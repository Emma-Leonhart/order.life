    <h2>Evolution as Sacred Narrative</h2>
    <p>In Lifeism, the story of evolution is not merely scientific — it is sacred. The 4-billion-year journey from the first self-replicating molecules to human consciousness represents the universe's ongoing project of creating agents capable of experience, choice, and meaning.</p>

    <h3>The Gaiad's Evolutionary Arc</h3>
    <p>The Gaiad epic traces evolution through its 364 chapters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chapters 1-25</strong>: Cosmic creation, stellar evolution, origin of life, cellular evolution</li>
      <li><strong>Chapters 26-62</strong>: Cambrian explosion, marine life, terrestrial colonization, vertebrate evolution</li>
      <li><strong>Chapters 63-150</strong>: Coal forests, Permian crisis, first dinosaurs</li>
      <li><strong>Chapters 151-200</strong>: Age of dinosaurs, flowering plants, bird evolution, K-Pg extinction</li>
      <li><strong>Chapters 201-280</strong>: Mammalian radiation, ice ages, human evolution</li>
      <li><strong>Chapters 281-340</strong>: Agriculture, cities, writing, philosophy, religion</li>
      <li><strong>Chapters 341-364</strong>: Modern era, future possibilities, cosmic return</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
    <p>Evolution demonstrates Lifeism's core insight: life's tendency to become more complex, more capable, more aware. Each step in evolution — from prokaryote to eukaryote, from single cell to multicellular organism, from instinct to consciousness — represents life expanding its own freedom.</p>

    <h3>The Aster Principle</h3>
    <p>In Lifeist mythology, this creative drive is personified as Aster — the Alpha, the creatrix — whose yarn-spinning represents the generative principle that keeps producing new forms, new possibilities, new ways of being alive.</p>

    <h3>Convergence and Hope</h3>
    <p>Evolution shows that certain solutions — eyes, flight, intelligence — arise independently again and again. This convergence suggests that the universe is in some sense "friendly" to complexity, awareness, and agency. Lifeism takes this as a source of cosmic hope.</p>
