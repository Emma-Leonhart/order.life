    <h2>The Moral Horizon: Universal Immortality</h2>
    <blockquote>If you love someone, you don't treat their annihilation as an aesthetic necessity.</blockquote>

    <h3>The Thesis</h3>
    <p><strong>Universal immortality</strong> means: the long-term civilizational goal of making continued existence available to all persons who want it, and preventing involuntary death wherever possible.</p>
    <p>It is "universal" because selective immortality — for elites only — would be a moral catastrophe, locking power forever and converting inequality into permanent caste.</p>

    <h3>What Immortality Means</h3>
    <p>Lifeism is pluralist about implementation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Preventing avoidable death</li>
      <li>Curing aging-related degeneration</li>
      <li>Reducing catastrophic risks</li>
      <li>Preserving identity and memory</li>
      <li>Expanding the space of possible lives</li>
      <li>Biological longevity research</li>
      <li>Cybernetic augmentation</li>
      <li>Advanced medicine</li>
      <li>Safer environments and better governance</li>
      <li>Robust mental health systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Immortality as Compassion</h3>
    <p>Lifeism refuses the moralization of death. Death is a tragedy we've normalized because we inherited it. The fact that something is ancient does not make it good.</p>

    <h3>Immortality and Meaning</h3>
    <p>A common objection is: "Wouldn't immortality make life meaningless?" Lifeism answers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meaning is not created by scarcity alone</li>
      <li>Meaning comes from relationship, curiosity, growth, art, mastery, service, play, exploration, and self-creation</li>
      <li>If death is the only reason you act, your meaning is fragile</li>
      <li>Lifeism seeks meanings that can survive abundance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Immortality Requires Governance</h3>
    <p>Lifeism treats immortality as inseparable from equity, safety, power distribution, reproductive ethics, resource management, and rights frameworks. Otherwise immortality becomes dystopia.</p>

    <h3>The Principle of Voluntary Exit</h3>
    <p>Lifeism advocates the right to continue, not mandatory continuation. A truly Lifeist world protects agency, including the possibility of a dignified end — handled with extreme care, strict consent standards, and safeguards against coercion.</p>

    <h2>Science and Technology</h2>
    <p>Lifeism is "pro-science" in a specific way: science is not a rival religion; it is one of life's most sacred tools.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Science</strong> expands what we can protect</li>
      <li><strong>Engineering</strong> turns compassion into infrastructure</li>
      <li><strong>AI</strong> is a moral amplifier: it can either concentrate power and risk, or distribute capability and safety</li>
      <li><strong>Medicine</strong> is spiritual work because it preserves persons</li>
      <li><strong>Information systems</strong> matter because memory is part of identity</li>
    </ul>
