So Claude broke the location widget thing. I am not sure if it is active, but can you try to fix it? Right now the location widget does not work at all.

I think that claude might restart and start working in an hour at 11:00 am pst, but can you try to fix it?

8 hours ago the widget worked perfectly in English, so something went wrong and I'm not sure what.

Also leave a message for claude or edit what I said since I didn't actually undo anything, and it is doing some localization work that might lead to a merge conflict and I want it to have context about that.
