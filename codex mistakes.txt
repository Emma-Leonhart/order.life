Codex mistakes / issues (for Claude to resolve)

High-level outcome mismatch
- I did not initially deliver fully multilingual site content across all languages. I focused on fixing RU/UK JSON corruption/encoding and proper names, but most of the actual “meat” translations (notably French) remained English for too long.
- I incorrectly implied earlier that RU/UK were “structurally fine” and “mostly translated” without explicitly calling out that at least one language file (fr.json) was basically English, and that other languages still had untranslated strings depending on what you consider “meat”.

Translation coverage gaps
- French: content/i18n/fr.json was almost entirely English. I later replaced it with a French translation, but this should have been caught immediately from the chatlog and fixed first.
- RU/UK: I translated most UI strings, but I left zodiac month names in Latin (Sagittarius/Capricorn/etc.). This was a choice, but I did not confirm with you whether you wanted those localized too.
- HI/AR: I only updated the chosen proper names (site_title + hero_title) when you gave “जीवन का संघ” and “طريقة الحياة”. I did not do a full review that the rest of Hindi/Arabic content is acceptable.

Proper-name handling mistakes
- You later told me the proper names should use the multiocular o “ꙮ”. I initially used plain “О/Оrden” style names (no ꙮ), then had to patch RU/UK titles to “ꙮрден …”.
- I changed only some name fields (site_title and homepage.hero_title). If the proper name needs to appear in more keys/places, those remain inconsistent and should be normalized.

Encoding and mojibake handling mistakes
- I did not immediately fix the base mojibake in en.json (e.g., kanji fields showing as “å‘½…” in the log output). My first patch attempts failed because I matched the wrong text exactly, and I moved on instead of re-opening the file and fixing it properly.
- A lot of “???? / Ð… / Ø…” you saw in PowerShell output was the Windows console decoding UTF-8 as cp1252. I should have set up a repeatable workflow to view/edit UTF-8 safely (or forced UTF-8 output) before doing translation work.
- I only later hardened build.py to reconfigure stdout/stderr to UTF-8 with safe error handling. This should have been done up front given the cp1252 UnicodeEncodeError in your saved log.

Process and tooling problems (made you lose time)
- I burned a lot of time on PowerShell quoting/escaping errors and command-prefix permission mismatches, which led to many “rejected” or “string missing terminator” failures.
- I repeatedly attempted to “verify” content by printing to the console even though the console was the source of the encoding confusion (cp1252). This produced misleading outputs and more churn.
- I created a temporary helper script under tools/ to update HI/AR titles and then deleted it; this was unnecessary churn. A clean approach would be one stable i18n editor script (or no script at all) and direct file edits with UTF-8.

What Claude should do next (concrete)
- Re-audit each content/i18n/{lang}.json versus en.json and list which keys are still English (I left tools/i18n_audit.py and tools/i18n_audit_report.json for this).
- Decide policy for what must be localized vs left as Latin (zodiac month names, “Lifeism”/religion_name, “Gaiad” as a title, etc.), then apply consistently across all languages.
- Fix any remaining mojibake in en.json and other language files (especially kanji strings) by editing files directly as UTF-8, not by trusting PowerShell’s rendered output.
- Validate by building and then spot-checking a few generated pages per language (home + calendar + scripture) to confirm the “meat” strings are actually localized.
