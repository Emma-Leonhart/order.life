# Chapter 55: The {{c|Forest}} {{c|Cathedral}}

As {{c|Devon}}'s sons grew strong and true in might,
The spineless sons of bright {{c|Proteus}} fair
{{c|Prepared}} themselves to join the ancient fight
For rule beneath the ocean's flowing care.

In {{c|Devon}}'s shadow they grew day by day,
Their strength increasing with each passing hour,
{{c|Building}} themselves to drink what victory's way
Would bring them through their faithful, growing power.

Among great {{c|Spiralius}}' noble line,
{{c|Neo}} arose in tenth generation's race
Of {{c|Bactridius}} blessed and divine,
The smartest soul in all his time and place.

{{c|Intelligence}} beyond what others knew
Or ever could pursue through all their days,
Yet what he possessed in genius true,
He lacked in wisdom's ancient, faithful ways.

He spurned his kin and ancestors so wise,
{{c|Refused}} to learn from those who came before
Who faced the storms beneath the starry skies
And learned through pain what peace was truly for.

And so he and his seed were cursed to bear
The weight of always starting from the start,
{{c|Reinventing}} what their fathers used to share
As wisdom's gift to guide the faithful heart.

{{c|Neo}} bore two sons of noble birth and might:
Great {{c|Ammon}} when the dawn began its day,
And {{c|Coleos}} the strong, whose faithful sight
Would guide him through his long and wondrous way.

Both sons would reinvent what fathers knew,
The wheel of wisdom that had come before,
{{c|Ignoring}} lessons that were tried and true
From those who'd walked this path from shore to shore.

{{c|Coleos}} wrapped his shell with mantle's care,
And through his innovation wrought with art
His shell's protection grew beyond compare
From mountain peak to shore, each single part.

His armor was complete from head to tail,
A fortress that would never know defeat,
{{c|Protection}} that would never, ever fail
To keep him safe from foe he chanced to meet.

Great {{c|Ammon}} grew a shell of coiled design,
{{c|Compact}} and true to serve his heart's desire,
{{c|Wherever}} destiny would draw the line
He'd dwell with freedom bright as sacred fire.

He swam through waters blue where others fished,
But made his home wherever he would roam,
{{c|Free}} as the wind that danced as he had wished
{{c|Throughout}} the vast and boundless ocean's dome.

Among the sons of bright {{c|Ectus}}' great might,
{{c|Malacus}} bore three sons of noble fame:
{{c|Caridus}} of the sea so fair and bright,
And {{c|Phyllos}} strong who'd honor his great name,

And {{c|Hoplos}}, through and through a warrior true
Whose heart was set upon the fighting way,
He'd play his part in all they'd ever do
With courage burning bright from night to day.

{{c|Caridus}} bore two sons beyond compare:
{{c|Syn}} {{c|Peras}} and great {{c|Yuval}}, answering
The call of destiny with faithful care
To make their lineage great in everything.

{{c|Throughout}} the world so wide from shore to shore
With ocean as their guide through all their days,
They'd build what none had ever built before
And walk in their appointed, faithful ways.

{{c|Peras}} bore children many, strong and true:
{{c|Amphipus}} none could match in all his might,
And brave {{c|Isopus}} too, and others who
Would serve with faithful hearts both day and night.

His wife, fair {{c|Possa}}, carried them with care
And never tarried in their nourishment,
{{c|According}} to her sacred, mother's prayer
And oath of love that heaven to her sent.

Of motherhood so pure it would endure
{{c|Throughout}} the years to come when wars were done,
Within her pouch they grew both strong and sure,
{{c|Fed}} by her love beneath the blazing sun.

Great {{c|Yuval}} bore two sons of different ways:
{{c|Decapus}} when the dawn began to break,
And {{c|Krillon}} small, who'd spend his faithful days
In answering the ocean's call for sake.

{{c|Krillon}} remained small throughout all his time
And swam beneath the skies of ocean blue
In all his days, and in his gentle rhyme
He kept his aquatic ways both tried and true.

But brave {{c|Decapus}} grew both large and strong
And took command by sinking to the floor
Of ocean's deepest realm, where all life long
He'd rule from mountain peak to distant shore.

And so the crustaceans would be ruled,
As was both right and proper they should be,
By three great houses, never to be fooled:
The lords of ocean's vast community.

{{c|Amphipods}} from the blessed, divine line
Of great {{c|Amphipus}}, noble, tried, and true,
{{c|Isopods}} from {{c|Isopus}}' design
Who'd make their father's legacy shine through,

And brave {{c|Decapods}} who came to fame
From great {{c|Decapus}}' everlasting name—
The three great houses whose eternal glory
Would last through all of evolutionary story.

{{c|Decapus}} bore two sons both tried and true:
Great {{c|Pleos}}, faithful through each passing day,
And {{c|Prawnmegas}} the great, whose destiny too
Would seal his lineage fate in every way.

{{c|Prawnmegas}} became the ancestor
Of prawns throughout the sea's community,
Their father and their faithful protector
Through all the years of their nativity.

An unfortunate son of {{c|Prawnmegas}},
Begun in sorrow and in bitter shame,
Still bears today his father's name, alas,
A reminder of his heritage and fame.

Great {{c|Pleos}} bore two sons of noble birth:
{{c|Repton}} to explore from sea to sea,
And brave {{c|Shrimpon}}, who'd prove his faithful worth
As father by the ocean's majesty.

{{c|Shrimpon}} became the noble, faithful sire
Of shrimp whose greatest joy and sweet desire
Was boxing and much more from shore to shore,
{{c|Protecting}} what they loved forevermore.

{{c|Repton}} bore two sons in their prime:
{{c|Thalasson}} of the mud, and {{c|Omar}}'s name
Whose blood would flow through generations' time
In lobster veins and bring eternal fame.

Great {{c|Omar}} became the faithful father
Of those who'd choose the lobster's bold way,
And crayfish too, who'd rather
Live with claws so mighty night and day.

{{c|Thalasson}} became the noble, faithful father
Of mud shrimp, who would build what none before
Had ever willed to make, and they would rather
Create than conquer—architects who bore

Great channels carved in stone that they called home,
{{c|Cities}} beneath the sea for all to see
{{c|Throughout}} eternity beneath the foam
Of ocean's vast and boundless majesty.

To this day we honor all their works
As donors of great beauty to the world,
Their cities where no evil ever lurks
In fossilized remains lie unfurled.

They tell us stories of {{c|Thallasintep}} great
And others who were sealed by loving fate
In stone for us to see and understand
Their architecture throughout ocean's land.

Their works survive time's most destructive hand
And speak to us across the years between
Of how great builders helped us understand
What beauty means and what it's always been.

{{c|Meiuron}}, noble son in the line
Of tenth generation of {{c|Thalasson}}'s race,
{{c|Rejected}} what his fathers thought divine
And chose to find a different dwelling place.

He left the depths that lay far below
To live upon the face of ocean bright,
Where currents and the tides would ever flow
Beneath the dome of day and stars of night.

{{c|Meiuron}} bore two sons of different ways:
{{c|Anomuron}}, begun in quiet peace,
And {{c|Saraton}}, who through his living days
Showed vanity that never seemed to cease.

{{c|Saraton}} was agile, skilled, and fast,
Yet vain and proud, his ego fragile too,
He needed praise from first day to last
In everything he'd ever try to do.

And so he constantly promoted well
His body as the best above the rest,
His propaganda had a tale to tell
Of how his form surpassed each other test.

But pride and shame had planted their dark seed
Within his heart, and blackened his good name,
For vanity will always intercede
Between the soul and honor's lasting fame.

The sons of brave {{c|Anomuron}} would live
In quiet ways when each new day begun,
They'd dwell in peace with all they had to give
Within their neighborhood beneath the sun.

As squat lobsters they'd make their dwelling place
And tell their stories of the humble way,
Of simple living and amazing grace
{{c|Throughout}} each blessed and ordinary day.

This quiet life would change in future time
When ten generations' faithful rhyme
Had passed away, and they would come to find
A different and more adventurous mind.

{{c|Paguros}} was a son of {{c|Anomuron}},
Begun with shell both weak and soft and frail
That others mocked from dusk until the dawn
And laughed at through each storm and gentle gale.

But in his dying breath before death came,
The {{c|Ammonite}} called {{c|Menses}}, full of grace,
Gave what dispenses shelter from all shame:
His shell to be {{c|Paguros}}' dwelling place.

And so {{c|Paguros}} became the faithful father
Of hermit crabs who bear with loving care
The shells that others left, and they would rather
{{c|Honor}} the dead than leave their treasure bare.

When death had been so kind to those before
As to release their hold on shells so bright,
The hermit crabs would use them evermore
As homes to keep them safe through day and night.

{{c|Alas}}, the great revolt of brave {{c|Proteus}}
Felt failure's bitter sting and painful dart,
No victory could come to those who'd thus
{{c|Rebelled}} with proud and unrepentant heart.

The great {{c|Protean}} rebellion failed to bring
{{c|Subjection}} to great {{c|Devon}}'s mighty reign
That had endured through every storm of spring
And lasted life long through joy and pain.

The sons of {{c|Devon}} held their righteous power,
They never fell to those who rose in vain
Against their rule through each appointed hour
{{c|Well}}-fenced by truth that broke rebellion's chain.

But lo! a new frontier was opening wide
Where sons of brave {{c|Proteus}} at last could find
What they had never found beneath the tide:
A land to heal their wounded heart and mind.

Beneath the ocean's wave they could not save
Their honor from the shame of their defeat,
But now a new realm called beyond the wave
Where they could make their victory complete.

The frontier of the trees where land could see
{{c|New}} possibilities for societies,
Where forest offered them the chance to be
The founders of new communities.

There sons of brave {{c|Proteus}} would find at last
{{c|Victorious}} domains to claim with pride,
And build upon the ruins of the past
With hope and truth as their eternal guide.

From {{c|Neo}}'s intelligence without the grace
Of wisdom from the past to guide his way,
To changes that would always show their face
In forms both old and new from day to day,

The lesson clear emerges for us all:
{{c|Intelligence}} alone will never last
Beyond our own brief span, but wisdom's call
To learn from those who've walked this way in past

Will build upon the stone of what they've known
And reach to greater heights with clearer sight,
While those who trust in their own strength alone
Will stumble in the darkness of the night.

From {{c|Ammon}}'s coiled shell to the story told
Of brave {{c|Paguros}} and his borrowed home,
The crustaceans show how hearts grown bold
Can find new ways to live where'er they roam.

The three great houses strong—{{c|Amphipods}} true,
{{c|Isopods}} faithful in their chosen place,
And brave {{c|Decapods}} with their royal hue—
Show how diversity brings strength and grace.

From prawns to lobster claws, each found their way
To follow nature's laws from shore to shore,
And mud shrimp cities built to last for aye
Show beauty in the depths forevermore.

The quiet squat lobsters and hermit crabs
Who foster care for shells that others left
{{c|Teach}} us that wisdom never fails or flags
When love protects us from all sense of theft.

The great {{c|Protean}} rebellion's bitter end
Opened the sight of forests green and wide,
Where those who fell could rise and make amend
With hope and truth as their eternal guide.

From {{c|Neo}}'s cursed pride to wisdom's light
That guides the hermit crab's protective shell,
The story shows us how to choose what's right
And build the future we would love to dwell.

The crustaceans teach us to design
Our lives with patterns beautiful and true,
That run through space and time in rhythm fine
With music of the spheres in all we do.

For those who dare to dream of something more
And turn their dreams to life through love, not strife,
Will find the paths that lead to wisdom's shore
Where all can share in everlasting life.
