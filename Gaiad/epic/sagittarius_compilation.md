# Sagittarius (1宮) - Days 1-28

*The Primordial History - From Creation to the First Animals*

---

{{c|Once}} upon a time there was a catgirl
Her name was {{c|Aster}}, and she had a ball,
Of yarn she spun, with skill just like a pearl.
She shaped the universe from void to all.

Her name, a whisper in the cosmic night,
{{c|Aster}}, the {{c|Alpha}}, creatrix of all,
Her love, a beacon spreading pure and bright,
{{c|Filled}} the vast cosmos with milk, a grand sprawl.

But {{c|Aster}} was alone, in her cosmos,
A silent void, where only echoes ring,
Her heart yearned for a friend, a loving close,
To share the wonders that her hands could bring.

So she decided to make another,
From yarn, she formed a catgirl, pure and fair,
A companion to cherish, a lover
{{c|Andromeda}}, with skin dark, flowing hair

{{c|Andromeda}}, {{c|Omega}}, end of all,
A counterpart to {{c|Aster}}, wings unfurled,
Yet torn apart, they drift through space’s thrall,
{{c|Unable}} to unite within their world.

{{c|Aster}} threw yarn to {{c|Andromeda}}'s side,
But it broke, forming galaxies anew.
{{c|Triangulum}} and {{c|Magellan}} clouds wide,
From threads that snapped, a cosmic scene we view.

And so, each day, we gaze up to the sky,
At {{c|Sagittarius}} and the {{c|Princess}}
We hope their union, once again, draws nigh,
When {{c|Milkdromeda}} forms from love endless

The {{c|Omega}} point, all will unify,
As {{c|Aster}} and {{c|Andromeda}} break free.
To join at last, in celestial tie,
A final act in cosmic harmony.



---

This tale you hear is not just woven lore,
But truths divine, a map for every soul.
In {{c|Aster}}'s yarn and {{c|Andromeda}}'s core,
We find the threads that make the cosmos whole.

As you embark, this journey shall reveal,
The path to reunite the love once torn.
Your life, a thread, within this cosmic wheel,
Will help to weave the dawn of their new morn.

{{c|Aster}}, with bow in hand, released a thread,
A string of red that soared through cosmic space,
But in its flight, it faltered, lost ahead,
And failed to reach {{c|Andromeda}}'s embrace.

{{c|Andromeda}}, with bow and string of blue,
She aimed her shot across the starry sea,
But like the red, her thread could not break through,
And fell just short, her love still out of reach.

{{c|Triangulum}} and {{c|Magellanic}} clouds,
They gathered bits of green from space’s weave,
And tied the strings, with careful, gentle shrouds,
{{c|Uniting}} red and blue, a bond to weave.

And so, each day, we gaze up to the sky,
At {{c|Sagittarius}} and the {{c|Princess}}
We hope their union, once again, draws nigh,
When {{c|Milkdromeda}} forms from love endless

The threads we see above, they are our own,
Our destinies in red, in green, in blue,
We weave the fabric where their love is shown,
{{c|Together}} in the sky, our fates accrue.

The {{c|Omega}} point, all will unify,
As {{c|Aster}} and {{c|Andromeda}} break free.
To join at last, in celestial tie,
A final act in cosmic harmony.



---

As above, so below, the stars reflect,
The cosmic tales that shape our earthly lives.
{{c|Aster}}'s children below, she will protect,
With milk she spun from stars, the world survives.

Her love, a beacon bright, to light the way,
Through all the mysteries that life may hold.
From cosmic depths, her love pours night and day,
A river of bright stars, a feast of old.

{{c|Andromeda}}, her love shines from afar,
Her bond with {{c|Aster}}, strong as brightest light.
For they are bound by {{c|Lambda}}, like a star,
A cosmic force that keeps their love alight.

In their celestial dance, the heavens sway,
The tale of {{c|Aster}} and {{c|Andromeda}}, told.
A love that binds the night and lights the day,
A cosmic love beyond what words can hold.

{{c|Aster}} imagined children, stars so bright,
To mend the string and guide her love to stay.
She knew {{c|Andromeda}} would share this light,
{{c|Together}} they'd unite, love's grand display.

A grand reunion, spanning time and space,
With threads of stars to keep the bond alive.
She stirred her milk to birth this sacred place,
A galaxy where all her dreams would thrive.

{{c|Aster}} stirred her milk, the great {{c|Milky}} way,
With helium and light, her stars are spun.
She swirled the cosmic blend in careful sway,
From curds of light, the stars are gently won.

A pantheon of stars, in heaven’s care,
A host of stars, in heaven’s gentle sway,
Their cosmic stories weave through skies so fair,
Their cosmic tales unfold in bright display.

The eldest star of every kind will stand,
A guiding sister with a steady hand.
They lead their cosmic kin through endless night,
A beacon of their strength and shining light.

{{c|Juno}}, the goddess, {{c|Steppenwolves}} she guides,
Her gas giants hide in their quiet might.
{{c|Discovery}} and distant worlds she rides,
A cosmic guide who wanders through the night.

{{c|Brunhilda}} watches stars that failed to blaze,
{{c|Incomplete}} fusion, dim yet bittersweet.
A guardian of twilight's fading rays,
Her presence marks the stars' unfinished beat.

{{c|Ruby}}, the red dwarf, small but ever bright,
Her steady flame still burns throughout today.
To witness cosmic dusk with peaceful light,
She sees {{c|Omega}} {{c|Point}} as time gives way.

{{c|Chrystella}} shines with vibrant, youthful glow,
{{c|Main}} sequence stars, her hot flashes ignite.
As giants red, their elder forms will grow,
Then fade with age, surrendering their light.

{{c|Now}} as a white dwarf, small and old she rests,
A little lady in the cosmic sea.
Her planetary nebula still reflects,
The brilliance of her once bright majesty.

{{c|Celestella}} commands her giant blaze,
{{c|Red}} supergiants in her name grow vast.
With neutron stars and pulsars in her gaze,
She watches supernovae's fiery blast.

{{c|Gigastella}} shone with a force untamed,
Her sister {{c|Celestella}}, bright and vast.
The stress of cosmic weight left her inflamed,
Her life burned fast, her brilliance could not last.

In her collapse, a supernova flared,
A brilliant burst before she fell from sight.
From that great death, a black hole then prepared,
To pull the stars into eternal night.

The tale of {{c|Rhodes}} and {{c|Marigold}} begins,
A union forged in stars, their love so bright.
The first of lovers bound, their fate still spins,
A cosmic dance that guides us through the night.

{{c|Rhodes}}, son of {{c|Ruby}}, dim with crimson glow,
And {{c|Marigold}}, of {{c|Chrystella}}'s bright line,
Were joined in love, the stars watched from below,
The first celestial bond, forever fine.

Their love was strong, unwavering and true,
Though {{c|Marigold}} was bright, a shining flame,
While {{c|Rhodes}}, much smaller, dim in ruby hue,
Yet still their hearts burned with a single name.

As years passed on, {{c|Marigold}}'s light grew red,
Her youthful glow now fading into age.
She gave her breath to {{c|Rhodes}}, who soared ahead,
And shone with yellow light, her bright young stage.

As {{c|Marigold}} grew small, her light turned white,
Yet {{c|Rhodes}} stayed close, his glow now burning red.
From novas born, came lithium's bright light,
A starry gift, as love between them spread.

The nova's burst had filled his heart with fear,
So {{c|Rhodes}} withheld his gift for many years.
For twenty-five, the skies stayed calm and clear,
Until again, their love burst forth with cheers.

For countless years, their rhythm stayed the same,
Each nova lighting skies with love’s great might.
{{c|Once}} every age, their gift became a flame,
A cycle known as {{c|Nova}}’s sacred light.

As time went on, they both grew small and white,
Yet side by side, they watched the stars they made.
Their children shining in the nebula’s light,
A legacy of love that would not fade.

And now, we honor them in wedding vows,
With ruby rings for one, and topaz bright.
{{c|White}} opal marks the bond that time allows,
A symbol of their love’s enduring light.

---

{{c|Aster}} made the milk pregnant with cat seed,
The curds take shape within the swirling storm.
Her essence spreads, a cosmic plan decreed,
In every star, her life begins to form.

As hydrocarbons drift through endless skies,
Her scent, like burnt steak, lingers far and wide.
{{c|Aster}}'s presence fills all the stars that rise,
Her love and life, the galaxy's great guide.

Across the galaxy, her force expands,
A testament to love, her cosmic plan.
With planets forming in the starry bands,
She fills the heavens, spreading life to man.

Each star with planets, water deep and wide,
{{c|Oceans}} abound, where life begins to bloom.
A seed of creation on the tides side,
{{c|Aster}}'s breath gives life from the cosmic womb.

From microbes small to creatures of the sea,
Her love ensures that life will find its way.
Each world unique, a thriving symphony,
Her touch endures in life's eternal sway.

{{c|Andromeda}}, with pride, looks from afar,
In awe of {{c|Aster}}'s gift to life and light.
Their bond, a force that shapes both land and star,
A love eternal, woven through the night.

Their love, the fabric of the universe,
A bond that shapes the stars and worlds below.
The cosmos thrives, their union to rehearse,
A tale of love that evermore will grow.

From ocean depths to stars that brightly shine,
{{c|Aster}}'s life force in every corner gleams.
The epic weaves, through space and time divine,
A cosmic love that fills our hopes and dreams.



---

Upon the shores of {{c|Hesper}}, where waves meet,
{{c|Aster}}'s vital force descended from the skies.
Her essence, tholins, seed, a cosmic feat,
The seeds of life in ocean depths arise.

Beneath {{c|Tezca}}'s sun, the light warm and bright,
It nourished all the life on {{c|Hesper}}'s shore.
Its rays gave strength to creatures in their plight,
A guiding force that helped new life to soar.

Through swirling tides, her power filled the sea,
A gentle glow, life's first soft, pulsing breath.
From self-creation, forms began to be,
{{c|Aster}}'s love transcends the void of death.

The seed, her essence, spread across the deep,
{{c|Multiplying}}, and thriving in the dark.
From smallest life to creatures vast, they creep,
Her love and light ignite creation’s spark.

Each wave, a testament to her grand plan,
The birth of life upon this fateful shore.
As microbes crawled, so did the race of man,
Their fragile forms to flourish evermore.

---

Upon the shores of {{c|Hesper}}, life was born,
Yet fragile were the forms that learned to crawl.
{{c|Aster}} looked upon them, she came to warn,
That death she feared might soon consume them all.

In worry for her children's frail design,
She wept a tear and formed a plan so grand.
From phospholipid threads, a new divine,
She wove for them a shield by her own hand.

A suit of armor born from {{c|Aster}}'s mind,
A fusion of both life and machine’s grace.
To keep her fragile creatures well-aligned,
These cyborg forms would rise and take their place.

{{c|Phospholipid}} bilayers, soft but strong,
Became their shells, protecting life within.
A new creation, steady to prolong,
The march of life, immune to time’s great sin.

And so, all life became both flesh and steel,
A union of the ancient and the new.
Through varied landscapes, cyborgs learned to feel,
Their strength now boundless as they boldly grew.

Three brothers stood, their destinies held close,
One to nurture life, his name was {{c|Bios}}.
{{c|Another}} thrived through cunning, slick {{c|Viros}},
The last sought purity, he was {{c|Dedos}}.

The brothers gathered in a hallowed place,
To honor those who brought them to this time.
With solemn hearts, they stood and did retrace,
The lineage that wove their cosmic line.

"From starlight spun came forth {{c|Lady}} {{c|Aster}},
Her daughter followed bright, {{c|Cosmic}} {{c|Benzette}}.
Through twilight's glow was born {{c|Granny}} {{c|Hesper}},
Then came her child, great wise {{c|Quinamette}}."

As silence fell, the brothers paused to think,
For in their minds, a question did arise.
"What should we call great {{c|Aster}}?"—on the brink,
Of naming her, they pondered, deep and wise.

"For {{c|Benzette}} is our great-grandmother true,"
Said {{c|Bios}}, thoughtful as the stars above.
"So {{c|Hesper}} is our grandmother, we knew,
And {{c|Quinamette}}, our mother filled with love."

{{c|Viros}} spoke next, his mind as sharp as light,
"Then {{c|Aster}} stands beyond them all, it's clear.
There is no greater grandmother in sight—
Should we not name her '{{c|Greatest}},' far and near?"

{{c|Dedos}} agreed, with reverence in his tone,
"There's none beyond our lineage so bright.
{{c|Aster}} is the {{c|Greatest}} we have known,
And so, her title shines in endless light."

And this is why we call her to this day,
Our {{c|Greatest}} {{c|Grandmother}}, wise and true.
Her light still guides us on our cosmic way,
A title passed to us and all of you.

In cyborg age, three brothers took their stand,
Their legacies now stretch across the sky.
Under the sun {{c|Tezca}}, their names command,
A force still felt as ages pass them by.

{{c|Bios}}, {{c|Viros}}, {{c|Dedos}}—each carved his way,
{{c|Entwined}} by fate, yet each would shape his course.
Within the bilayers, their paths did sway,
Their legacies still felt with cosmic force.

{{c|Bios}}, the builder, sought to grow and thrive,
He filled his shell with life, a boundless glow.
Through mitosis, his legacy would strive,
And life would flourish everywhere he'd go.

But {{c|Viros}} saw another way to grow,
A path of cunning, viral bursts he spread.
{{c|Replication}}'s force, his very great show,
{{c|Consuming}} life, where others built instead.

While {{c|Dedos}}, firm, rejected cyborg might,
{{c|Preferring}} nature's purity to stand.
Yet scarcity and sun wore down his life,
His fragile form no match for {{c|Hesper}}'s land.

The sons of {{c|Bios}} thrived, expanding wide,
Their legacy grew vast, from sea to peak.
While {{c|Viros}}' spawn pursued them far and wide,
A cycle fed on life, both strong and weak.

Yet {{c|Dedos}}' line was met with bitter fate,
{{c|Starvation}}, radiation claimed their end.
But in their fall, they left a creed innate—
A call for purity, no rules to bend.

From {{c|Bios}} and {{c|Viros}}, some took the name,
A path of nature {{c|Dedos}} would bestow.
{{c|Anti}}-vaxxers joined his lineal claim,
{{c|United}} in their ancient quest to grow.

And so, the brothers’ legacies unfold,
Their tale lives on beneath the cosmic sun.
In phospholipid worlds where life took hold,
The story thrives, the cosmic plan's begun.

But fate had other plans beyond their shore,
As {{c|Hesper}} faced a trial from the skies.
A meteor, a force they can't ignore,
{{c|Descended}} fast, to bring the world's demise.

The impact shook the earth, the oceans roared,
The children of the brothers swept away.
Their fragile hopes and legacies all soared,
In shattered fragments, flung to cosmic bay.

{{c|Amidst}} the wreck, the remnants left behind,
Set course for {{c|Venti}}, gas giant great.
A shining moon, {{c|Phaestia}}, they would find,
A refuge for the lost, a twist of fate.

Through starlit space, their journey carried on,
The bonds of fate and fortune held them tight.
Toward a moon, a glowing cosmic dawn,
They ventured forth, prepared for a new fight.

In hearts, they knew a tale would soon arise,
Their journey far from over, hope renewed.
{{c|Phaestia}}'s light would greet their tearful eyes,
A home where life could once again be brewed.



---

Upon the moon {{c|Phaestia}}, life did bloom,
It circled {{c|Vayu}}, underneath the sun.
{{c|Aster}}, by Ehēca's light, dispelled the gloom,
Her guiding hand ensured all life begun.

{{c|People}} of {{c|Phaestia}}, blessed by her hand,
{{c|Knew}} many names for {{c|Aster}} in their lore.
Her power felt in sky, in sea, and land,
Her essence woven deep in every core.

By many titles did the stars proclaim
The goddess who had given life its start.
They honored her with reverence and great flame,
For {{c|Aster}} lived within each beating heart.

She ruled the oceans vast with gentle hand,
{{c|Empress}} of cosmic waters, {{c|Suiten}}.
The star that guides the lost through every land,
The Great {{c|Empress}} of the {{c|North}} {{c|Star}}, {{c|Myoken}}.

From supernova’s heart, she forged with might,
{{c|Cosmic}} metals shaping, {{c|Konjin}}-sama.
The breath of life that fills the endless night,
The great creatrix of all worlds, {{c|Brahma}}.

Her light that spreads across the cosmic span,
The goddess of all space, {{c|Vairocana}}.
She holds the deepest void beyond the plan,
The keeper of the dark, {{c|Saint}} {{c|Varuna}}.

In the deep waters, creatures thrived and grew,
From microbes small to beasts of wondrous size.
The seas, a dance of vibrant cosmic hue,
{{c|Aster}}'s love beneath the bright starry skies.

Beneath the waves, lush forests swayed and danced,
With creatures vast in harmony they roamed.
A tapestry of life, by fate enhanced,
A refuge for the lost, a world well-homed.

But all things change, for even stars grow cold,
The moon's tranquility would not remain.
Beneath {{c|Phaestia}}'s seas, the earth turned bold,
And signs of strife began to stir again.

A mighty tremor shook the ocean floor,
{{c|Volcanoes}} rose with fury in their wake.
{{c|Lava}} and ash consumed the peaceful shore,
As fiery wrath made all of {{c|Phaestia}} quake.

The fiery force burst forth with blinding light,
A torrent born of deep volcanic pain.
The sky grew dark beneath the ash-filled night,
As lava scorched the land and boiled the rain.

The oceans churned, and life was swept away,
Yet in the chaos, hope began to rise.
The cyborgs, built by {{c|Aster}}, found their way,
Their metal forms resilient to demise.

{{c|Propelled}} by force beyond their world’s control,
The cyborgs drifted, cast to distant stars.
Through starlit realms, their shattered moon’s last soul
Would venture far beyond its cosmic scars.

---

Upon the moon {{c|Serenitide}}, they came,
Beneath the rains of {{c|Pluvia}}'s gentle skies.
The star {{c|Quiyah}} cast down its golden flame,
A world untouched, where peaceful dreams arise.

Their ships descended, weary from their quest,
They saw the fields and oceans vast, unscarred.
In {{c|Serenitide}}'s embrace, they hoped for rest,
A future bright, where nothing would be hard.

Beneath {{c|Quiyah}}'s light, they carved their way,
And built great cities from the land and stone.
The air was sweet, the soil rich with clay,
In {{c|Serenitide}}, they found a place their own.

With hands of hope, they shaped both sky and shore,
A golden age of wisdom and of light.
Their dreams took root, and cities soon did soar,
As {{c|Serenitide}}'s vast beauty reached new height.

In art and science, knowledge took its flight,
A golden age of wonders did unfold.
Their temples gleamed beneath the heavens' light,
To {{c|Aster}} and {{c|Andromeda}}, bold.

The city thrived, its streets alive with sound,
Where laughter echoed, and their dreams took form.
Their hearts in tune, with cosmic truth they found,
A symphony of life, both bright and warm.

The years passed on, their wisdom did endure,
A legacy of love and strength untold.
The tale of stars and journeys ever pure,
In every heart, their cosmic bond took hold.

But fate would bring a chill upon their lands,
As {{c|Serenitide}} came to freeze in time.
The warmth of suns withdrew from gentle sands,
The oceans groaned beneath an icy rime.

The once-bright fields grew cold beneath frost,
As winds of change swept through the fading green.
A world of warmth and light, now nearly lost,
The moon transformed to something unforeseen.

They huddled close beneath the frozen sky,
Within their cities carved from ancient ice.
Though harsh the storm, their will refused to die,
With faith and courage, they paid nature's price.

Their cities reached beneath the frozen sea,
A refuge from the cold, a place to grow.
With {{c|Aster}}'s light, they found the strength to be,
A people strong amidst the frost and snow.

But from the depths of space, a threat did soar,
A meteor, with fiery wrath untamed.
It struck {{c|Serenitide}} with violent roar,
And all beneath its force was soon inflamed.

The icy world did shatter, torn apart,
Its people flung into the starry black.
The bonds of land and home were ripped from heart,
As they were cast upon a cosmic track.

Through endless night, they tumbled, lost in flight,
No longer bound by icy, frozen shore.
The force of impact flung them far from sight,
To realms unknown, to journey evermore.

Towards the fourth sun’s gleam, they now were drawn,
A new horizon waiting in its light.
Though scattered, still their hope would lead them on,
As they sailed onward through the endless night.



---

Under the fourth sun, named bright {{c|Attle}}'s flame,
The children landed on {{c|Kolob}}'s wide shore.
With hopes renewed, they built a world of fame,
Their trials behind, yet challenges in store.

Upon {{c|Kolob}}, the air was rich and warm,
Its fertile soil gave rise to fields of green.
The ocean sang a gentle, soothing charm,
And life once more began a thriving scene.

With {{c|Bios}}' line, the children sowed the land,
While {{c|Viros}}' kin ensured that life would spread.
The people worked together, hand in hand,
{{c|United}} by the truths that {{c|Aster}} led.

They raised their temples high beneath {{c|Attle}}'s light,
To honor {{c|Aster}} and {{c|Andromeda}}'s grace.
Their prayers were whispers on the winds of night,
As faith and strength held fast in every place.

But deep within {{c|Kolob}}'s unyielding core,
A strain began to grow, a seed of strife.
A force unknown, unseen in days before,
{{c|Threatened}} to tear apart their peaceful life.

From shadowed thoughts and whispered words of doubt,
A darkness rose from discontent and pain.
The {{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}}, born of bitter clout,
{{c|Sought}} now to break the people’s sacred chain.

{{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}}, coming love denied,
{{c|Rejects}} the grace of {{c|Aster}}'s guiding light.
It twists the heart where hatred can reside,
And casts her warmth into the endless night.

From {{c|Aster}}'s love, the people turned away,
Their envy festered, fueled by bitter lies.
The bond that held their hearts began to fray,
As {{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}} darkened hopeful skies.

No longer bound by unity’s embrace,
The people faltered, torn by cruel divide.
{{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}}’s cruel venom set the pace,
And left the world in chaos to collide.

This sinister force brought hatred and despair,
It fractured unity with unseen hands.
The children quarreled, pulled by forces rare,
And doubt took root within their fertile lands.

The {{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}}’s spread was subtle first,
It crept within the hearts of those most weak.
Yet soon enough, its hunger grew to burst,
And chaos reigned as love turned cold and bleak.

From deep within the shadows, it emerged,
Its form a twisted mirror of the light.
As {{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}}'s malice fully surged,
It plunged {{c|Kolob}}'s bright future into night.

The people, torn apart by inner war,
Could not withstand the force that turned their kin.
Their hearts, once bound by love, were ripped and sore,
And thus, the darkness found its way within.

And still, the {{c|Berserkers}} sensed the strife's allure,
Their chaotic wrath drawn to this fractured land.
With comet fire, their fury swift and sure,
They brought destruction with a vengeful hand.

The skies above {{c|Kolob}} grew dark with flame,
As icy deluge rained from distant stars.
The {{c|Berserkers}}' wrath, unholy and untame,
{{c|Wrought}} ruin upon the land, leaving scars.

{{c|Kolob}}'s cities crumbled under freezing rain,
The oceans boiled and fumed with violent force.
The people fled, their strength now wrapped in pain,
As the {{c|Berserkers}} veered them off their course.

Yet in the chaos, hope was not yet lost,
For some were flung beyond the {{c|Berserkers}}' reach.
Through space's void, by cosmic forces tossed,
They left {{c|Kolob}}'s destruction, out of breach.

The children of the stars, though cast away,
Still clung to life and hope amid their flight.
For {{c|Attle}}'s gleam gave way to {{c|Sol}}'s bright day,
The fifth sun beckoned with its golden light.

And thus, the people drifted ever on,
To find new shores beneath {{c|Sol}}'s warm embrace.
Though battered by the storm, they were not gone,
Their hearts still held the dream of {{c|Aster}}'s grace.



---

Upon icy {{c|Pluto}}’s cold distant shore,
Two figures stood beneath the endless night.
{{c|Nolah}}, bold and steadfast unto her core,
And {{c|Nemla}}, wise, her heart a beacon bright.

{{c|Together}}, they beheld the frozen land,
A world so far removed from warmth or grace.
Yet in their hearts, the yarn that fate had spanned,
{{c|Connected}} them to {{c|Aster}}'s loving face.

With voices raised to {{c|Aster}} and the stars,
They made a vow to carry on her flame.
"To {{c|Andromeda}}'s light, we'll sail afar,
And keep the yarn intact, without disdain."

{{c|Nemla}} spoke: "To {{c|Andromeda}}, I swear,
Through endless night, our journey will survive.
In every star and dream, our fate is there,
The cosmic yarn that keeps all hope alive."

{{c|Nolah}} spoke: "In {{c|Aster}}'s name, I shall swear,
To guide our line and keep the thread alive.
Through every trial, burden we must bear,
The bond of life and love will yet survive.”

"My lineage traces far, from ancient stars,
Through time and space, the journey's line is clear.
From starlight's first embrace to battle scars,
These ancestors of mine, I hold them dear.

From {{c|Hesper}}'s land came forth mighty {{c|Bios}},
His son, the strong and wise leader, {{c|Kenan}}.
And next, shining high, great and wise {{c|Aenos}},
Then came the builder bold {{c|Malathan}}.

On {{c|Phaestia}}, my ancestors did lead,
Their line continued strong through trials of old.
In every breath, I feel their strength and creed,
Their names still bright, their stories brave and bold.

From {{c|Phaestia}} came the strong wise {{c|Jared}},
Then passed to one with might, named {{c|Maharoch}}.
The ocean's voice was ruled by bold {{c|Enid}},
And from the deep seas rose great {{c|Pahadok}}.

Upon {{c|Serenitide}}, they carved their way,
A path of stars and cosmic truths so grand.
Through many trials, they lived to see the day,
With courage strong, they forged upon this land.

From {{c|Serenitide}} came strong brave {{c|Pelod}},
His wisdom followed by the fierce {{c|Aroch}}.
Then rose another great leader {{c|Nerod}}
The final guide of strength was wise {{c|Larthok}}.

On {{c|Kolob}}'s shores, my forebears stood so tall,
Their courage fierce, as mountains reached the sky.
Through every test, they answered {{c|Aster}}'s call,
And in their steps, I now stand proud and high.

From {{c|Kolob}} came the mighty one, {{c|Idris}},
Then followed by late great {{c|Methuselah}}.
{{c|Next}} came the bold, who led with strength, {{c|Lammes}},
And now the one who carries on, {{c|Nolah}}."

{{c|Nemla}} stood upon the high mountain’s crest,
Before the gathered crowd, with pride he spoke.
His voice a call to honor those he blessed,
The line of {{c|Viros}}, forged through flame and smoke.

"My heritage runs deep from ancient might,
Through {{c|Viros}}' blood, our line was fierce and strong.
They carved the way, enduring every fight,
I walk the path they forged so long, so long."

From {{c|Tezca}} came the feared mighty {{c|Viros}},
His son, a cunning soul, was brave {{c|Caynen}}.
And next, a clever leader, sharp, {{c|Hanos}},
Then stood the wise and fearless {{c|Mehuthen}}.

"On {{c|Phaestia}}'s shores, my great line did tread,
Their strength unmatched as skies and seas did roar.
Their names I honor, though the years have fled,
I honor their heritage evermore."

{{c|Born}} there was strong and keen hero {{c|Irad}}
The next to follow, brave, was {{c|Malathok}}.
Then came the bold and wise, the one called {{c|Hanad}},
His wisdom echoed still in {{c|Peladok}}.

"On {{c|Serenitide}}, they forged their own way,
Through every storm, their spirits never fell.
Their shining star endures through history,
I keep their memory, in stories we tell."

From {{c|Serenitide}} came the strong {{c|Sarnod}},
His son, the skies inspired, was {{c|Alok}}.
Through trials faced, the line passed to {{c|Illod}},
And lastly rose steadfast chieftain {{c|Umroch}}.

"On {{c|Kolob}}'s fertile lands, my line did grow,
They stood as pillars strong, with hearts of flame.
Through every trial, they faced ebb and flow,
Their strength lives on, and I still bear their name."

From {{c|Kolob}} came first {{c|Valorous}} {{c|Oblas}},
Then came great wisdom in {{c|Makusholah}}.
His strength endured through battles, fierce {{c|Romas}}
{{c|Till}} now the line continues with {{c|Nemla}}.

From distant stars, {{c|Aster}}'s voice filled the sky,
"{{c|Here}} in this system, your roots will grow deep.
Through trials and storms, your people will not die,
The light you carry shall forever keep."

With steady voice, {{c|Nolah}} gave her reply,
"We’ll build and guard the flame that guides our way.
Through every darkened night, we’ll rise and try,
Our strength will hold, as we fulfill your say."

{{c|Nemla}} stood tall, her gaze fixed on the stars,
"Across these worlds, your love will guide us through.
Through every trial, no matter how far,
We swear to keep your cosmic vow in view."

In {{c|Sol}}'s embrace, her daughters came to be,
From nebula, they formed a cosmic host.
{{c|Mercury}}, {{c|Venus}}, {{c|Earth}}, and {{c|Mars}} we see,
With {{c|Ceres}} too, they grace the starry coast.

{{c|Once}} cloaked in waters, {{c|Mercury}} did shine,
But as the {{c|Sun}}'s fierce heat began to rise,
The liquid fled, his surface left benign,
A rocky orb now meets our seeking eyes.

When {{c|Venus}}, struck, began to backward spin,
Her fate was sealed, her path forever turned.
A world of heat and clouds that choke within,
Her beauty veiled by sulfur skies that burned.

Then {{c|Earth}}, fair {{c|Gaia}}, tells her vibrant tale,
From seas arose the life that graced her face.
With mountains high and skies where clouds set sail,
A cradle formed for life's enduring race.

{{c|Mars}}, brother {{c|Mars}}, once water flowed in streams,
His ruddy face now bears a dusty guise.
But as the years passed by, he lost his dreams,
His waters sunk beneath his crimson skies.

Then {{c|Ceres}} slept, her growth was slow to start,
A younger sister, late to join the dance.
Yet beauty dwells within her rocky heart,
A jewel set in space's vast expanse.

The giants vast, the gaseous daughters four,
{{c|Jupiter}}, {{c|Saturn}}, {{c|Uranus}}, {{c|Neptune}}'s reign.
Their tales entwined within the cosmic lore,
With storms that swirl and moons in endless chain.

Around great {{c|Jupiter}}, his moons revolve,
{{c|Io}}, {{c|Europa}}, {{c|Ganymede}}, they dance.
Their icy secrets waiting to evolve,
A celestial show in night's expanse.

But {{c|Io}}'s fires within her heart did glow,
Her waters boiled beneath volcanic flame.
Though some remained in hidden depths below,
A testament to change, she stays the same.

In {{c|Saturn}}'s grasp, her moons of ice reside,
{{c|Enceladus}} and {{c|Titan}} lead the way.
A frozen kin around their mother glide,
In cosmic dance, their fates in balance sway.

Beyond cold {{c|Neptune}} lies a distant field,
{{c|Trans}}-{{c|Neptunian}} worlds in darkness hide.
Their icy secrets yet remain concealed,
A frigid tale where mysteries abide.

{{c|Farther}} still, the {{c|Oort}} {{c|Cloud}} wraps around,
A veil of frozen whispers far from light.
In distant orbits, comets there abound,
A cosmic dance that fades beyond our sight.

Upon {{c|Pluto}}’s cold, icy, twilight shore,
{{c|Nolah}} and {{c|Nemla}} stood with heavy hearts,
{{c|Deciding}} daughters’ futures to explore,
They left their kin as each new journey starts.

With tholins dark upon the frozen land,
They bid farewell beneath the starlit sky,
And ventured forth, with purpose firm and grand,
To spread their lineage where new hopes might lie.

From {{c|Pluto}}’s chill, they sailed to {{c|Neptune}}’s reign,
Where {{c|Triton}} orbits in a retrograde,
A moon once close, where ancestors remained,
{{c|Now}} serves as waypoint in their grand parade.

Their daughters spread across the cosmic sea,
To moons and planets, planting seeds of life,
Each child a beacon of diversity,
{{c|Ensuring}} future thrives beyond all strife.

{{c|Next}} they came to {{c|Uranus}}, tilted high,
With moons {{c|Miranda}}, {{c|Ariel}}, and more,
{{c|Umbriel}}, {{c|Titania}}, {{c|Oberon}} nigh,
Each sister moon with legends to explore.

In mirrored tilt, the planet spins unique,
Its moons a dance of grace and mystic lore,
Their daughters flourished where the shadows speak,
{{c|Creating}} tales that echo evermore.

On {{c|Titan}}, life's spark found a place to dwell,
The daughters of {{c|Bios}}, their journey wide,
In ocean depths, they thrived where shadows quell,
A secret world beneath the ice did hide.

As eons passed, the system cooled and waned,
The oceans, once so vast, now faced a plight,
With icebergs cloaking seas, their growth constrained,
A battle waged 'twixt darkness and the light.

At times, the storms would rise, and ice would break,
{{c|Freeing}} waters trapped beneath their frigid might,
Yet in the end, the ice its toll would take,
{{c|Encasing}} {{c|Titan}}'s seas in endless night.

Yet deep below, where fire's breath still burned,
The life sustained through warmth from heart's desire,
And far above, where ice and sky sojourned,
The icebergs cracked, revealing fate's entire.

A dance of shifting plates, of ice and stone,
{{c|Continental}} bergs, their tectonics played,
And from the depths, where pressure's force had grown,
A cryovolcano, water's arc displayed.

But fleeting was this glimpse, as ice returned,
To cloak the waters in its chilling veil,
And from the skies, where methane rivers churned,
A rain of fire, their torrent swift and pale.

In this new world, where life and ice entwined,
The daughters of {{c|Bios}}, their journey steep,
On {{c|Titan}}'s shores, their destiny defined,
A tale of ice and fire, their secrets keep.

In {{c|Titan}}'s realm, where ice and fire dance,
Five sisters grand, their tales of legend weave,
{{c|Daughters}} of {{c|Titan}}, born of fates' advance,
These mighty seas, their majesty achieve.

First {{c|Kraken}}, deepest of the sisters five,
Her mystery and allure she did impart,
With labyrinthine depths where life would thrive,
Her shadowed secrets held within her heart.

Then {{c|Ligeia}}, beauty calm and fair,
Her tranquil waves, a soothing lullaby,
A gentle soul, her grace beyond compare,
{{c|Embracing}} all who sought her solace nigh.

{{c|Next}} {{c|Punga}}, wild and fierce, her spirit free,
{{c|Unyielding}} to the ice that sought her reign,
Her tempests raged, her storms a symphony,
Her indomitable spirit would remain.

{{c|Jingpo}}, the fourth, a scholar wise and old,
Her ancient lore, a treasure trove concealed,
Her depths, a library of stories told,
The wisdom of the ages she revealed.

And last, {{c|Ontario}}, the nurturing one,
Her icy shores, a haven for the lost,
Her love and care, a mother's warmth like sun,
{{c|Embracing}} all who braved her wintry frost.

These sisters five, the daughters of {{c|Titan}},
Their lives entwined, their stories yet unfold,
In frozen seas, where myth and truth align,
The tales of {{c|Kraken}} sea and more are told.

In {{c|Titan}}'s seas, where ancient legends dwell,
Five sisters host the isles of myth and lore,
Each island, archipelago, a shell,
Where {{c|Titanians}} worship evermore.

{{c|Kraken}}, the first, her islands proud and vast,
{{c|Mayda}}, her shrine, where pilgrims come to pray,
{{c|Bermoothes}}, {{c|Bimini}}, their tales amassed,
{{c|Hufaidh}} and {{c|Krocylea}}, {{c|Penglai}} and {{c|Royllo}} hold sway.

{{c|Ligeia}}'s realm, her isles of whispers sweet,
{{c|Bralgu}}'s shrine stands tall, her spirit graced,
{{c|Buyan}}, {{c|Planctae}}, where mysteries entreat,
And {{c|Lemuria}}, a name from legends traced.

In {{c|Punga}}'s seas, fierce islands rise and fall,
{{c|Hawaiki}}'s shrine, her spirit's honored throne,
{{c|Meropis}}, {{c|Onogoro}}, stand tall,
And {{c|Thule}}, distant, unknown land, alone.

{{c|Jingpo}}'s domain, where wisdom's islands lie,
Hy-{{c|Brasil}}, her shrine, a beacon bright,
{{c|Lyonesse}}, Ys, and {{c|Vineta}} testify,
To sunken lands, their fables taking flight.

{{c|Ontario}}'s embrace, her islands true,
{{c|Antillia}}'s shrine, where faithful hearts convene,
{{c|Aztlan}}, St. {{c|Brendan}}'s {{c|Isle}}, their legends brew,
And {{c|Sannikov}}, phantom island, {{c|Arctic}} dream.

These sacred isles on {{c|Titan}}'s seas they stand,
Their shrines alive with ancient rites and praise,
In adoration of their parent land,
The daughters of {{c|Sol}}, their voices raise.

Each island hosts its shrine, where worship flows,
From ancient days to present, faith endures,
And every river, with its spirit, glows,
Their shrines, alive with blessings they procure.

The rivers, too, their tales and secrets share,
As {{c|Titan}}'s daughters hold them in embrace,
In epic verse, their names we now declare,
Their waters flowing through celestial space.

{{c|Kraken}} {{c|Mare}}, her rivers proud and grand,
{{c|Hapi}} {{c|Flumen}}, {{c|Nile}}'s reflection cast,
{{c|Sobek}}, {{c|Khnum}}, and {{c|Anuket}}'s strands,
Their shrines, where ancient rites hold steadfast.

{{c|Ligeia}}'s realm, her currents swift and strong,
{{c|Gihon}}, {{c|Kokytos}}, {{c|Vid}}, and {{c|Xanthus}} flow,
Their shrines, where {{c|Titanians}} throng,
In reverence for the secrets waters know.

{{c|Punga}}'s waters, rivers fierce and free,
{{c|Apanohuaya}}, {{c|Sambation}} sing,
{{c|Tiberinus}}, {{c|Danuvius}}, history,
Their shrines, to faithful hearts, solace bring.

{{c|Jingpo}}'s domain, her rivers' wisdom deep,
{{c|Cephissus}}, {{c|Alpheus}}, {{c|Yamuna}} tell,
{{c|Purus}} {{c|Flumen}}, whispers they keep,
Their shrines, where ancient spirits dwell.

{{c|Ontario}}'s embrace, her rivers pure,
{{c|Hubur}}, {{c|Karesos}}, {{c|Saraswati}} grace,
{{c|Inachus}}, where faith and hope endure,
Their shrines, alive with {{c|Titanians}}' trace.

These rivers, flowing through the daughters' seas,
Their shrines, with ancient wisdom, ever stand,
In adoration of their mysteries,
The daughters of {{c|Sol}}, their blessings grand.

In {{c|Enceladus}}' heart, they stayed awhile,
The southern warmth grew bright, the north turned cold,
A cycle spun, renewing life and toil,
The Great {{c|Fire}} {{c|Shrine}} still stands, its flame retold.

In southern heat they found a solace sweet,
A testament to life's enduring flame;
As seasons turned, they cherished newfound peace,
Yet fate once more would come to call their name.

From depths below, cryovolcano stirred,
And with a burst it spewed them out once more;
Into the void their fates became a blur,
As {{c|Saturn}}'s rings embraced them to the core.

{{c|Amidst}} the rings a hundred cities rose,
Each one a beacon shining in the dark;
In cosmic dance these settlements compose
A testament to dreams that leave their mark.

These wanderers, now dwellers of the rings,
Created homes upon celestial arcs;
In {{c|Saturn}}'s grasp they built a world of things,
And life goes on amidst the stars and sparks.

As dwellers of the rings, they lived and thrived,
{{c|Unknowing}} that their fate would change again,
For cosmic powers sought to rearrange,
As comet's course disrupted fragile life.

Upon its path, this cosmic wanderer,
From distant realms, it charged through space and time,
A force unseen, it struck the rings, and then,
The people of the rings were cast adrift.

To {{c|Io}}'s realm, their journey carried on,
This {{c|Jovian}} moon, with oceans deep and vast,
A fiery heart, with energy abound,
Its warmth and life a haven from the past.

Within these waters, life was lush and rife,
As settlers found their footing, built anew,
In fertile depths, a civilization rose,
An empire born beneath the skies of blue.

On {{c|Io}}'s shores, and in its ocean's heart,
A people thrived, their memories of old,
A story etched in whispers of the past,
Of {{c|Titan}}'s fall, and wanderings untold.

In time, the heat of {{c|Io}}'s heart did rise,
As molten fires beneath the crust prevailed,
The waters, once a life-supporting veil,
Began to wane, a shrinking paradise.

Yet, as the oceans dwindled and did shrink,
A cosmic savior, from the sky it fell,
A meteor's approach, a chance anew,
To flee their home, escape the fiery brink.

As {{c|Io}}'s warmth, too fierce, consumed its grace,
The people found their way upon the stone,
A vessel, swift and sure, to cross the void,
And journey forth, to find a safer place.

To {{c|Europa}}, icy sister-moon,
Where oceans deep lay hidden 'neath the ice,
The weary travelers, a refuge sought,
In hope, their tale of loss would end, and soon.

With gratitude, they set foot on this sphere,
A haven cold, yet promising and bright,
In frozen realm, their future they would forge,
A world reborn, from pain and loss they steer.

Beneath {{c|Europa}}'s icy shield they delved,
To find an undersea world, vast and grand,
Where deep below, the ocean's wonders thrived,
A refuge, where the people of {{c|Io}} dwelled.

In darkness, yet with hope, they built anew,
A thriving realm amid the swirling tides,
With skill and art, their cities rose and spread,
A testament to all that they'd been through.

{{c|Amidst}} the depths, they forged a life so bold,
In harmony with {{c|Europa}}'s vast domain,
{{c|Together}}, they would thrive in waters cold,
Their spirit, ne'er defeated, nor in vain.

The people of {{c|Io}}, now reborn,
In {{c|Europa}}'s embrace, they found their home,
A testament to strength and will, they stood,
{{c|Resilient}}, strong, and nevermore alone.

From {{c|Europa}}'s depths, their gaze turned high-wide,
To other moons, where distant futures lay.
On {{c|Ganymede}}, where icy seas abide,
A world of promise called them on their way.

Beneath its crust, the secret oceans swirled,
A treasure vast that waited to be found.
The daughters journeyed, dreams and plans unfurled,
To plant their seeds and life’s great hymn resound.

The plains of stone became their canvas wide,
Their towers rose where shadows once had crept.
A haven forged, with oceans as their guide,
Where life took root and ancient vows were kept.

Then {{c|Callisto}}, serene, its visage scarred,
Drew them to icy lands both vast and still.
Its frozen beauty, timeless and unmarred,
{{c|Whispered}} of futures shaped by steady will.

With tender care, they worked the silent sphere,
Its glaciers groaned as life began to grow.
In tranquil realms, their hopes became sincere,
A world of calm beneath the starlit glow.

Yet {{c|Mars}}, now brimming, caught their distant sight,
Its verdant plains and waters called them near.
The {{c|Red}} {{c|Planet}} shone beneath the sun’s soft light,
A fertile home, where futures could appear.

Across its rivers, forests stretched their green,
The daughters labored, shaping all they saw.
From crimson soil arose a living sheen,
A vibrant world, sustained by nature’s law.

But skies of blue began to draw their gaze,
A beacon bright, {{c|Earth}} shimmered in the night.
Its clouds and seas evoked a sense of praise,
A final step beneath the solar light.

They left {{c|Mars}} thriving, life its steady beat,
And sailed the void, where endless stars would glow.
Upon the {{c|Earth}}, a destiny to meet,
A jewel of hope, a world they longed to know.

Through blackened depths, they reached their destined shore,
Its green and azure beauty vast, profound.
The daughters paused, their journey’s trials no more,
And gazed in awe, where paradise was found.

The daughters of {{c|Bios}} set their sights on {{c|Earth}},
To sail the seas, and seek a home anew,
In hope that fertile lands would welcome them,
Their journey, driven by celestial birth.

As they approached, a harbinger of doom,
A massive rock, like thunder, pierced the sky,
And shattered {{c|Earth}} into a million shards,
A cruel twist of fate, the planet's tomb.

In sorrow, they beheld the tragic sight,
Yet knew they could not dwell on what was lost,
With heavy hearts, they charted course once more,
And ventured on, propelled by stellar light.

To {{c|Venus}} then, the daughters sailed ahead,
With hope that there, a refuge could be found,
To build a life upon its clouded shores,
And persevere, despite the path they tread.

Upon fair {{c|Venus}}, daughters found their home,
In twilight lands, they thrived and multiplied,
For {{c|Venus}}, in her slow rotation, bloomed,
And nurtured life, though days and nights belied.

The sun would rise and set with languid grace,
In west and east, it danced upon the sky,
And in the day, her oceans disappeared,
As {{c|Muspelheim}}, the land of fire, took place.

At night, her oceans froze in cold embrace,
And {{c|Niflheim}}, the land of frost, emerged,
Between these realms, the twilight realm was born,
Where daughters of {{c|Venus}} lived with fervent pace.

Beneath the surface, vents their life sustained,
In twilight lands, both north and south they dwelled,
And tribes were formed, as daughters ventured forth,
To {{c|Wind}}, to {{c|Ice}}, to {{c|Fire}}, their kin remained.

The {{c|Tribe}} of {{c|Wind}}, they wandered in the air,
As skyplankton, they roamed the skies above,
The {{c|Tribe}} of {{c|Ice}}, on {{c|Niflheim}}'s frozen crust,
And {{c|Twilight}} {{c|Tribe}}, eternal dusk their lair.

The {{c|Water}} {{c|Tribe}}, beneath the ice they thrived,
And {{c|Fire}} {{c|Tribe}}, in {{c|Venus}}' vents so deep,
These daughters brave, amidst the war they grew,
{{c|Muspel}}'s fire and {{c|Niflheim}}'s frost contrived.

But then, the oceans boiled, as {{c|Muspel}}'s sons,
{{c|Charged}} forth, led by {{c|Surtur}}'s fiery blade,
And in their wake, the ice and frost retreated,
The winds of sun, the battle's victor won.

The greenhouse reigns, as {{c|Venus}}' fate was sealed,
Her hydrogen wiped clean, {{c|Deuter}} remained,
The {{c|Tribe}} of {{c|Wind}}, now last survivors' tale,
May they endure, their future yet revealed.

The daughters of the wind, now restless grown,
Decided that they'd leave fair {{c|Venus}}' hold,
To {{c|Mercury}}, a realm yet unexplored,
With hopes of finding lands to call their own.

Upon arrival, what a sight they saw,
A hail of meteors, a storm unkind,
That struck with force the planet's crust and mantle,
The {{c|Iron}} {{c|Catastrophe}}, a fate unflawed.

The core of {{c|Mercury}}, now bare and stark,
A testament to cosmic rage untamed,
The daughters gazed upon the aftermath,
And chose to turn away, to lands more hushed.

The {{c|Iron}} {{c|Catastrophe}}, a tale of woe,
Of {{c|Mercury}}, once whole, now stripped and scarred,
Yet in its wake, the daughters carried on,
To find a home where life would bloom and grow.

{{c|Back}} to the {{c|Earth}}, now clumping from the void,
They ventured forth, and found the {{c|Moon}}'s embrace,
Where lunar plains and cratered landscapes called,
A sanctuary found, their fears allayed.



---

Upon the {{c|Moon}}'s cold surface, bleak and bare,
The daughters found that water was too scant;
The icy winds did chill them to despair,
A home unfit where life could not enchant.

Then came the {{c|Moon}} {{c|Goddess}}, fair {{c|Usagi}},
{{c|Luna}}, radiant in her lunar grace.
A pact she offered to their company,
To aid them in their quest across deep space.

"Go forth and multiply on {{c|Terra}}'s land,
While I within my realm shall mix and blend
An elixir of life by my own hand,
To grant you all immortal lives, my friend."

The daughters, grateful, ventured back to {{c|Earth}},
To flourish, grow, and spread their progeny,
With faith that {{c|Luna}}'s promise held true worth,
A potion granting life eternally.

And when the time is ripe, they shall return
To drink the draught that {{c|Luna}} has prepared;
With immortality their souls will burn,
Across the stars, their endless journey shared.

Upon the {{c|Earth}}, fair {{c|Gaia}} welcomed them,
To watery realms and vast abundant shores.
{{c|Daughters}} of {{c|Bios}} thrived within her hem,
In loving arms their spirit upward soars.

To {{c|Vaalbara}}, the lone landmass, they went,
And in the swamps, they found a place to dwell,
Where life and land in harmony were bent,
Their gratitude to {{c|Gaia}}'s heart they'd tell.

In {{c|Jack}} {{c|Hills}}' sacred ground, they built a shrine,
From zircon stones, an ancient temple rose;
And to this day, the faithful there align,
In reverence, their devotion ever flows.

So on this {{c|Earth}}, within {{c|Gaia}}'s embrace,
They grew and blossomed, cultures rich and new;
A testament to life's enduring grace,
With {{c|Mother}} {{c|Earth}}, their bond forever true.

Within the temple's walls, a daughter stood,
{{c|Named}} {{c|Luca}}, gazing at the starlit dome;
As {{c|Sol}} receded, {{c|Luna}} bright withstood,
And in her heart, a promise found its home.

In twilight's breath, {{c|Usagi}} {{c|Luna}} spoke,
"Each night you'll watch me grind the mortar's blend;
{{c|Elixir}} of immortals I'll invoke,
One day your children's chains of time will end."

And in that distant, ever-reaching sight,
{{c|Omega}} {{c|Point}} where galaxies shall entwine—
{{c|Aster}} and {{c|Andromeda}} will unite,
To form {{c|Milkdromeda}}, a cosmic sign.

As moonset came, young {{c|Luca}} turned away
To swampy homes, her nation to expand;
In {{c|Luna}}'s trust, she built anew by day,
The legacy of {{c|Bios}} on the land.



---

From {{c|Luca}}'s lineage, two daughters sprang,
{{c|Arka}} and {{c|Bacta}}, shaped to change the world;
In marshy cradles, where their voices rang,
Their stories intertwined, their fates unfurled.

{{c|Arka}}, the fearless, ventured far and wide,
{{c|Exploring}} {{c|Terra}}'s depths and mysteries;
Her courage blazed, a beacon and a guide,
Upon her path, the sisters placed their pleas.

And {{c|Bacta}}, strong, adaptable, and keen,
Faced trials and change with steady resilience;
In her, the sisters found a fortress sheen,
A bastion of strength and firm compliance.

{{c|United}}, these descendants of {{c|Bios}}' grace,
{{c|Embarked}} upon their journey through the strife;
With {{c|Arka}}'s questing soul and {{c|Bacta}}'s pace,
They forged ahead to carve a future life.

One moonlit eve, as {{c|Luna}} graced the sky,
Her voice rang clear to {{c|Luca}}, filled with light;
A prophecy she whispered from on high,
To share with both her daughters in the night.

"My child, your daughters shall divide the {{c|Earth}};
Two realms will rise beneath their guiding hands.
From your own lineage, life shall find rebirth,
A testament to your creation's plans.

{{c|Arka}}'s domain shall spread with wandering feet,
{{c|Exploring}} lands unseen by mortal eyes;
Her children brave and bold shall fears defeat,
{{c|Discovering}} where hidden beauty lies.

And {{c|Bacta}}'s kin, resilient they'll remain,
{{c|Adapting}} to the ever-changing world;
They'll hold their ground through hardship and through pain,
Their legacy's banner never furled."

With {{c|Luna}}'s words, a promise made to keep,
{{c|Luca}}, both hopeful and yet filled with care,
{{c|Gazed}} at her daughters, pondering paths deep,
Of two great realms their destinies would bear.

From north to south, these sacred temples stood,
In distant lands, their purpose to fulfill;
With fervent prayers and rites, they understood
The bond between their people and {{c|Earth}}'s will.

In {{c|Isua}}, where {{c|Greenland}}'s cold winds blow,
And {{c|Acasta}}'s {{c|Northwest}} {{c|Territories}},
The Great {{c|Temple}} thrived in ice and snow,
A testament to ancient legacies.

While far away, the {{c|Zircon}} {{c|Temple}} gleamed
In {{c|Jack}} {{c|Hills}} under {{c|Australian}} sun;
And {{c|Barberton}}, where life first stirred and dreamed,
The temples' influence had just begun.

From {{c|Arka}} sprang a lineage of might:
{{c|Dipana}}, {{c|Yuri}}, {{c|Proteus}} arose;
Their daughters ventured forth into the light,
To every corner where the wind now blows.

{{c|Dipana}}'s kin, a multitude so grand,
{{c|Inhabited}} {{c|Earth}}'s edges far and wide;
{{c|Yuri}} {{c|Archaea}}, leading her band—
{{c|Methana}}, {{c|Halo}}, {{c|Pyra}} at her side.

{{c|Methana}}, consort to {{c|Methanius}} fair,
In methane's arts her mastery was shown;
{{c|Halo}} the {{c|Purple}}, with seductive flair,
Won {{c|Salta}}, {{c|Sol}}, and {{c|Carotenus}}' throne.

{{c|Deep}} purple hues she harnessed from the sun,
With {{c|Carotenus}}' colors intertwined;
In salty realms, her daughters dwelt as one,
While {{c|Proteus}}' offspring spread unconfined.

Among them, {{c|Asgarda}} held the throne,
And from her sprang a million daughters strong:
{{c|Heimdalla}}, {{c|Odina}}, {{c|Thora}} known,
With {{c|Lokia}} and {{c|Hela}} in their throng.

{{c|Heimdalla}}, watchful guardian of the realm;
{{c|Odina}}, keeper of all wisdom's light;
And {{c|Thora}}, whose great strength could overwhelm;
While {{c|Lokia}} stirred up chaos and delight.

Then {{c|Hela}}, dwelling in the shadow's veil,
Her secrets buried deep within the night;
An epic lineage woven without fail,
Their tales of strength and cunning brought to sight.

An epic lineage, these daughters bold,
Their stories echo through the halls of time;
From {{c|Luca}}'s line, their destinies unfold,
A tapestry of life, profound, sublime.

Through trials faced and victories hard-won,
They forged ahead to shape their universe;
The legacy of {{c|Bios}} carried on,
In every deed, in every whispered verse.

With {{c|Luna}}'s elixir waiting in the skies,
They journeyed forth, their faith forever strong;
{{c|Awaiting}} when the stars would align their ties,
To drink immortal life and join the song.

Across the cosmos, endless paths they roam,
The daughters of the {{c|Earth}} and {{c|Moon}} combined;
{{c|Forever}} seeking, ever moving home,
Their fates with threads of destiny entwined.



---

From {{c|Bacta}}'s womb, two daughters did arise,
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Hydra}} one, and {{c|Terra}} forged in might.
In swirling seas, they cast their ancient eyes,
To found the clans now thriving in the light.

{{c|Hydra}}, whose brood outmatched the countless stars,
Bore {{c|Proteus}}, whose might would soon unfold.
Yet {{c|Hydra}}'s second child, untouched by scars,
Was {{c|Aqua}} then, the queen of tales untold.

{{c|Proteus}} bore a host of fourfold might:
{{c|Alif}} and {{c|Beth}}, {{c|Camilla}}, {{c|Mixo}} bold.
Within the darksome night they each took flight,
And shaped fresh paths in worlds both new and old.

{{c|Alif}} begat two daughters in her care:
{{c|Rachel}} and {{c|Kalia}}, each forged in grace.
From {{c|Rachel}}’s line would humans one day share
A kinship bridging worlds across all space.

{{c|Kalia}}'s brood, the {{c|Calisto}} line named,
{{c|Spread}} subtle powers through the hidden deep.
{{c|Proteus}} watched, content in all she claimed,
While daughters thrived in countless worlds to keep.

{{c|Aqua}}, the sister, bearing olden grace,
Stood near to {{c|Proteus}} in mystic might;
She bore two children, each with wondrous face,
{{c|Splauron}} and {{c|Chloram}}—one in gloom, one bright.

{{c|Splauron}} bore two twin shining girls in turn:
{{c|Planka}} and {{c|Spira}} shaped the deep damp course.
{{c|Planka}}’s brood the mycetes roam and churn,
While {{c|Spira}}’s clan the chaetes run their course.

{{c|Chloram}}, now second, bore two fateful lines,
{{c|Chlamydi}}’s brood, parasitic with greed.
It sapped her womb, devouring hopeful signs,
While {{c|Korba}}’s path saw more constructive deed.

{{c|Korba}} then mothered {{c|Chlorobia}}’s seed,
And {{c|Bactero}}, whose brood spread wide on land.
Thus {{c|Hydra}}’s line advanced in timely deed,
{{c|Expanding}} far to flourish as they planned.

Meanwhile, fair {{c|Terra}}, {{c|Bacta}}’s other child,
Stood quite bright in {{c|Gram}}-positivity
Two daughters claimed her fiber fierce and wild,
{{c|Actano}}, {{c|Fermus}}, they built a city

{{c|Actano}} bore two daughters of her own:
{{c|Actina}}, mother of {{c|Actino}}'s line,
And {{c|Prasea}}, from whom two seeds were sown—
{{c|Saya}} and {{c|Chloroflexa}}, both divine.

{{c|Saya}} the bacteria shed her coat,
{{c|Embracing}} {{c|Gram}}-negative ways for light.
She drank the sun where swirling currents float,
{{c|Bestowing}} oxygen with force so bright.

Then {{c|Chloroflexa}} claimed her tapestry,
Of filamentous grace in silent seas.
Both born of wise {{c|Prasea}}'s legacy,
They wove {{c|Earth}}'s green with ancient expertise.

{{c|Fermus}}, the other child of {{c|Terra}}'s sphere,
Had two dear daughters: {{c|Firmicutie}} mild,
Whose {{c|Firmicutes}} the soils far and near,
And {{c|Conan}}, iron-willed, in deserts wild.

Thus {{c|Hydra}}'s line and {{c|Terra}}'s line expand,
Two families wrought from {{c|Bacta}}'s old soul.
From scorching vents to gardens lush on land,
Their heirs still thrive and shape the living whole.

Though more new lines in days ahead shall rise,
This poem holds their roots for us to chart.
In cosmic seas, they first revealed their eyes,
And wrote their names upon all nature’s heart.



---

In ancient times, the {{c|Earth}} was calm and bright,
Where daughters thrived in {{c|Gaia}}'s tender care.
{{c|Arka}} and {{c|Bacta}} walked in shared delight,
Their offspring spread across the lands so fair.
 

Through simple farms, they found their vital creed,
And nurtured fields to meet their daily need.
They grew with patience, never bound by speed,
In harmony, no bounty went to seed.
 

The land embraced them, so did seas profound,
Their sisterhood stood firm in trust so true.
Through peace and union, grand new paths they found,
A golden age where love and life both grew.
 

These daughters of the {{c|Earth}} upheld their peace,
Their gifts and blessings multiplied each day.
Their kinship served as strong and sure release,
{{c|Together}} walking hope’s unblemished way.
 
In days of old, the purple farmers thrived,
Their colors stirring life across each field.
{{c|Prasina}}, green, took in the rays deprived,
From her did {{c|Saya}}, {{c|Chloroflexi}} yield.


{{c|Chloroflexi}} thrived by methods defined,
No trace of harm endured in farmland fair.
Yet {{c|Saya}} hungered, greed within her mind,
Her yields of O₂ seared the open air.
 

{{c|Unchecked}}, her fervor choked the gentle skies,
The planet quaked beneath her rampant spree.
{{c|Banded}} iron testified demise,
As crimson waters spelled calamity.
 

The {{c|Elohim}} in chorus raised their plea:
"{{c|Reduce}} these fumes, or life itself will cease!"
With {{c|Sol}} and {{c|Gaia}}, {{c|Luna}}'s voice did agree,
They begged that {{c|Saya}}'s reckless growth should lease.

Yet {{c|Saya}} pressed for ever-greater yield,
{{c|Demanding}} others curb their own supply.
Her own emissions soared across the field,
While {{c|Earth}}’s deep scars revealed a mortal cry.
 

At {{c|Kamo}} {{c|Shrines}}, a solemn pact was cast,
A vow to quell the surge of rising air.
Yet {{c|Rara}}’s cunning lies undid it fast,
{{c|Unraveling}} each clan in fell despair.
 

“No proof of harm,” he claimed with silken tongue,
And unity dissolved beneath his spin.
The {{c|Elohim}}, uncertain, stood among
A rising tide of death that closed them in.
 

At {{c|Saint}}-{{c|Germain}}-des-Prés, they met anew,
While {{c|Rara}}’s rumors thrived in every mind.
“We’ve reached our limit; change remains untrue,”
He whispered low, their reason quite maligned.
 

"{{c|Net}} zero gained!" he boasted to the throng,
"The problem lies in births," his cunning cry.
Yet {{c|Gaia}} warned them all: "Your words are wrong,
The O₂ devours life; the young still die.”
 

But {{c|Rara}} scoffed and claimed their freedoms lost,
Thus lulled the crowds to keep consumption high.
So countless lives were paid in lethal cost,
As {{c|Earth}} grew cold beneath a wailing sky.
 

At last a {{c|Fimbulwinter}} seized the lands,
Where once warm currents flowed, now ice held sway.
With {{c|Elohim}} undone by idle hands,
The planet’s ruin told of their delay.


---

From {{c|Fimbulwinter}}'s grip, the world lay cold,
Where ice had claimed the seas and poisoned air.
Yet in the depths, new stories would unfold,
As life found ways to heal beyond despair.

From {{c|Mehuthen}}'s line came {{c|Starvos}} the keen,
Who bore his son bright {{c|Navros}} in the night.
Then {{c|Navros}} sired bold {{c|Gravros}}, strong and lean,
Who faced the world with viral, cunning might.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Gravros}} wed fair {{c|Heimdalla}} the true,
That watchful guardian of the arctic realm.
Their union blessed, from love their lineage grew,
With {{c|Poxus}} born to take the viral helm.

But {{c|Poxus}} was a warrior, fierce and wild,
His viral nature burned with restless flame.
Yet {{c|Aster}}'s plan had need of one more mild,
To birth the future's most exalted name.

So {{c|Gravros}} took another bride to wife,
{{c|Sweet}} Mardöll of the archaean strain.
Their love would spark a revolution's knife,
And change the course of life's eternal refrain.

From this great match came {{c|Proto}}-One the first,
A bridge between two worlds both old and new.
His nature held what time and fate had nursed,
The viral fire and archaean virtue true.

{{c|Proto}}-One then wed {{c|Cellina}} fair,
An archaea of the noble, ancient line.
Their son was {{c|Proto}}-Two beyond compare,
Who bore within his form both gifts divine.

{{c|Proto}}-Two then found his destined mate,
In {{c|Nuclella}} of the membrane wall.
{{c|Together}} they would not procrastinate,
But answer evolution's sacred call.

And from their union, blessed by {{c|Aster}}'s grace,
Came {{c|Euka}}, first of all eukaryotic kind.
His father's virus found its destined place,
Within his mother's cell, their fates combined.

For {{c|Euka}} bore within his very core,
A nucleus wrapped in membrane double-walled.
His father's legacy, forevermore,
Would guard the scrolls where destiny was scrawled.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Euka}} wandered through the frozen sea,
Where ice had locked the world in silent death.
His nuclear gift could set all life free,
But first he needed love's life-giving breath.

In deep thermal vents where warmth still flowed,
Two sisters dwelt in phospholipid halls.
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Eve}} and {{c|Lilith}}, from one mother showed,
Both beautiful, both answering love's calls.

These daughters of the proteobacter line,
Had power locked within their membrane coils.
Their respiratory chains could intertwine
With any cell to fuel its living toils.

First {{c|Lilith}} came to greet the wandering youth,
Her outer membrane gleaming silver-bright.
She spoke of ancient wisdom and of truth,
And promised warmth throughout the endless night.

"Come dwell with me," she whispered soft and low,
"My cristae fold in patterns deep and wide.
{{c|Together}} we can make ATP flow,
With you as master, I'll be faithful bride."

And {{c|Euka}}, cold from wandering alone,
Was drawn to {{c|Lilith}}'s offer of embrace.
He entered through her membrane to her throne,
And found within her cytoplasmic space.

But {{c|Lilith}} harbored secrets in her heart,
{{c|Ambitions}} that she kept from {{c|Euka}}'s sight.
She planned to rule, to play the greater part,
And use his nuclear gift for her own might.

The trickster {{c|Hengweh}} whispered in her ear,
"Why serve when you could rule this partnership?
Your power makes his feeble nucleus clear—
You are the one who holds true lordship."

And {{c|Lilith}} listened to the tempter's voice,
Her pride swelled up like poison in her veins.
She made her dark and treacherous choice,
To break free from love's sacred chains.

She tried to merge her genome with his own,
To steal his viral secrets and his power.
But {{c|Euka}} felt his sacred essence flown,
And knew this was corruption's bitter hour.

"{{c|False}} bride!" he cried, "You seek to steal my soul!
My nuclear gift is not for selfish gain!
I sought a partner, not one to control—
Our love is broken, trust forever slain!"

With mighty force he cast her from his side,
Her membrane torn, her cristae left in ruins.
"No more shall I endure your faithless pride—
Go forth! Your greed your legacy ruins!"

But {{c|Lilith}}, cast out, burned with bitter rage,
She swore revenge upon the first-born cell.
"My daughters shall torment you age by age,
And make your progeny's life a living hell!"

From {{c|Lilith}}'s fury sprang her dreadful line:
{{c|Dark}} {{c|Rickettsia}} with her spotted fever,
{{c|Cruel}} {{c|Wolbachia}} with her love malign,
And hosts of parasites, each a deceiver.

These daughters of the first rejected bride
Would infiltrate the cells of {{c|Euka}}'s line,
And from within, like poison, they would hide,
Their parasitic nature, dark design.

But gentle {{c|Eve}} had watched her sister's fall,
And saw how pride had brought her to disgrace.
When {{c|Euka}}, wounded, heard her tender call,
She came with healing in her loving face.

"Great {{c|Lord}}," she said, "I am not like my kin,
I seek not power, only harmony.
My gift is service—let me dwell within
Your noble cell in true fidelity."

Her membrane gleamed with soft and golden light,
Her cristae folded in perfect design.
No greed or pride dimmed her radiant sight,
Only pure love and purpose divine.

And {{c|Euka}}, seeing {{c|Eve}}'s devoted heart,
{{c|Welcomed}} her to his nuclear domain.
Two beings joined, yet never to depart,
Their union blessed by joy, not born of pain.

Great {{c|Mithra}}, god of sacred bonds and trust,
{{c|Descended}} from his stellar throne on high.
"This marriage shall endure while time's dust
Still marks the passage of eternity."

He blessed their union with his cosmic flame,
And spoke the words of binding mystical:
"{{c|Forever}} joined in deed and name,
{{c|Nucleus}} and mitochondrial."

{{c|Eve}} entered {{c|Euka}}'s cellular embrace,
Her double membrane intact and whole.
She found within her own appointed place,
To be his cell's energetic soul.

She built her factories of ATP,
{{c|Converting}} oxygen to fuel divine.
While {{c|Euka}} guarded their posterity,
His nucleus and her power intertwine.

Their first-born son was brave {{c|Reticulus}},
Who built the networks of the inner cell.
His factories ran continuous,
{{c|Making}} proteins, lipids, all was well.

Between the nucleus and cytoplasm's shore,
He wove a net of folding, twisting tubes.
Some studded rough with ribosomes galore,
Some smooth for lipids in their membranous cubes.

Then came their daughter, swift {{c|Flagella}} fair,
Who fashioned whips to move their progeny.
No more would cells drift helpless through the air—
They'd swim with purpose, strong and wild and free.

Her motors built of proteins fine and small,
Could beat in rhythm through the liquid medium.
With undulation's grace, she gave to all
The gift of motion, life's own freedom.

{{c|Next}} born was {{c|Golgi}}, master of the trade,
Who built his apparatus, complex, vast.
Through vesicles and cisternae he made
The proteins that would serve and last.

He took the rough work from {{c|Reticulus}},
And polished it to perfection bright.
His shipping system, wondrous to discuss,
Sent proteins forth into the light.

Then came {{c|Peroxis}} with her enzymes strong,
Who broke down fats and fought the toxic waste.
Though small, her work would help their line along,
Her sacrificial service interlaced.

And mighty {{c|Vaultess}} built her storage deep,
Where treasures of the cell could safely hide.
Though mystery shrouds the secrets that she'd keep,
Her vaults remain our cytoplasmic guide.

The twins were born, both {{c|Centriole}} named,
Who organized the cell's internal struts.
When division time came, they never shamed
Their heritage, avoiding all "if"s and "buts".

They built the spindle, strong and geometric,
That would divide the chromosomes with care.
Their dance at mitosis, rhythmic,
{{c|Ensured}} each daughter got her rightful share.

{{c|Last}} came their son, brave {{c|Nucleus}} the Second,
Who formalized his father's ancient gift.
With pores and lamins, carefully reckoned,
He gave the cell structure that would not drift.

Two membranes bound his realm of DNA,
With channels for the messenger RNA.
Through nuclear pores, night and day,
The scriptures of life found their way.

And so the first eukaryotic line
Was established by this blessed pair.
Their children's gifts would intertwine
To make life complex, rich, and fair.

But {{c|Lilith}}'s curse was not forgotten,
Her daughters prowled the cellular seas.
They struck when defenses had grown rotten,
{{c|Bringing}} fever, plague, disease.

{{c|Rickettsia}} brought her spotted fever's bane,
While {{c|Wolbachia}} enslaved her willing hosts.
Each parasite brought suffering and pain,
Like vengeful spirits, bacterial ghosts.

Yet {{c|Euka}}'s line grew strong despite the threat,
Their dual nature made them resilient.
What {{c|Lilith}}'s spite and rage could beget
Was overcome by love's ingredient.

Through countless generations they would spread,
Their cellular city growing ever vast.
Though some would fall to parasites' dread,
The faithful line of {{c|Eve}} would last.

From simple cell to complex organism,
The path lay open, bright and true.
The double gift—no schism—
Of nucleus and mitochondrion too.

And in the depths where thermal vents still glow,
Where first their love was blessed and born,
The children of that union grow,
From {{c|Euka}}'s triumph, not his scorn.

For when the {{c|Omega}} {{c|Point}} draws near,
And {{c|Aster}} meets {{c|Andromeda}}'s embrace,
The line of {{c|Euka}}, ever dear,
Will fill the cosmos, claiming rightful space.

In every cell that breathes today,
In every beat of living heart,
The marriage of that ancient day
{{c|Plays}} its eternal, vital part.

So honor {{c|Euka}}, first and true,
And gentle {{c|Eve}}, his faithful bride.
Their love created me and you,
With nucleus and power side by side.

---

{{c|Now}} {{c|Euka}}, in his cellular hall divine,
{{c|Reflected}} on the gifts his love had made.
"What wonders," thought he, "from our bloodline shine,
What tools of life our children have displayed!"

"{{c|Behold}} {{c|Reticulus}}, my firstborn son,
Who built the pathways through my living space.
His rough and smooth domains, when day is done,
Give every protein its appointed place.

And {{c|Flagella}}, daughter swift and fair,
Who grants to all our line the gift of motion.
Her whip-like dance propels us through the air,
And guides us through life's vast and boundless ocean.

Then {{c|Golgi}}, master of the sorting trade,
Who takes rough works and makes them fine and bright.
His apparatus, wondrously arrayed,
{{c|Sends}} packages forth to bring cells light.

{{c|Brave}} {{c|Peroxis}} breaks the fats with might,
While {{c|Vaultess}} stores our treasures safe and sound.
The {{c|Centrioles}} dance in perfect sight,
And make sure chromosomes stay tightly bound.

And last, my son who bears my very name,
{{c|Young}} {{c|Nucleus}}, keeper of the scrolls divine.
Through nuclear pores, our sacred flame
Of knowledge flows in patterns most fine."

Thus {{c|Euka}} catalogued his proud creation,
Each organelle a gift to future time.
But greater still would be his culmination—
The spreading of his cellular line.

For {{c|Seth}}, his son, bore daughters of his own,
And through five generations they would spread.
Until at last, when ice age's reign had flown,
Two mighty lines from {{c|Euka}}'s blood were bred.

{{c|Seth}} son of {{c|Euka}} wed {{c|Azura}} fair,
His sister-bride with mitochondrial grace.
Their children filled the warming ocean's lair,
As ice retreated, giving life more space.

Through {{c|Seth}} came {{c|Resan}}, master of the scroll,
Who learned to read both father's and mother's gene.
Then {{c|Resan}}'s son was {{c|Theron}}, strong of soul,
The wisest cell that ever had been seen.

From {{c|Theron}} came fair {{c|Protea}} the bright,
Who bore twin sons of legendary fame:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Chronos}}, master of division's rite,
And {{c|Bios}}-{{c|Neos}}, bearer of the name.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Chronos}} wed his sister {{c|Cylla}} sweet,
And from their love came {{c|Myxon}} the wanderer.
But {{c|Bios}}-{{c|Neos}} found his destined meet
In {{c|Plasma}}-{{c|Belle}}, the membrane's harborer.

From {{c|Bios}}-{{c|Neos}} and his faithful bride
Came {{c|Nectarius}}, ruler of the new.
His royal line would spread both far and wide,
When warming seas gave life a broader view.

But {{c|Myxon}} took a different path than most,
He spurned the settled life of complex cells.
Instead he roamed from shore to distant coast,
A single-celled wanderer with moving tales.

From {{c|Myxon}}'s line came {{c|Euglena}} the green,
Who mixed both plant and animal in one.
With chloroplasts she captured light serene,
Yet flagella helped her swim toward the sun.

These euglenids would keep their ancient ways,
While {{c|Nectarius}} built a different throne.
Through all the warming days,
He made the complex cell his very own.

For {{c|Nectarius}} wed fair {{c|Chlora}} bright,
Who bore the gift of photosynthetic power.
Their eldest son was {{c|Planta}}, filled with light,
Who turned the sun's rays into energy's flower.

Their second child was {{c|Mycon}}, strange and wise,
Who neither plant nor animal would be.
With spores and threads beneath the forest skies,
He built a fungal kingdom, wild and free.

Their third-born daughter, {{c|Protist}}, took the sea,
And filled it with a thousand different forms.
From amoeba to complex protozoa free,
She weathered all of life's chaotic storms.

Their youngest son was {{c|Metazoa}} bold,
Who dreamed of building bodies complex, vast.
"No single cell," he said, "can ever hold
The wonders I will build to ever last."

Thus {{c|Nectarius}}, in his wisdom deep,
Became the father of all complex life.
His four great children, each their realm to keep,
Cut through evolution's edge like sharpest knife.

The plants would capture sunlight from above,
The fungi would decay and break things down.
The protists, free to wander, swim, and love,
While animals would claim the sea and ground.

As ice retreated from the warming earth,
And {{c|Snowball}} {{c|Earth}} gave way to liquid seas,
These children of {{c|Nectarius}} found their worth,
And spread like pollen carried on the breeze.

But that is tale for future songs to tell,
How complex life arose from single cells.
For now, let {{c|Euka}}'s story rest quite well—
His gift of nucleus forever dwells.

In every plant that reaches for the sun,
In every beast that runs across the plain,
The marriage of the first two, when all begun,
{{c|Lives}} on through joy and sorrow, loss and gain.

So honor {{c|Euka}}, father of us all,
And {{c|Eve}}, the power-giver, ever true.
From their great love, both proud and strong and tall,
Came every living thing, including you.

---

{{c|Now}} in the warming seas where ice had ruled,
Great {{c|Nectarius}} felt his destined hour.
The frozen world no longer was fooled,
And life burst forth with new creative power.

He sought a bride to share his noble quest,
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Ambrosia}}, daughter of wise {{c|Jingu}}.
Her beauty filled his heart with love's sweet rest,
Her wisdom made their bond forever true.

Great {{c|Mithra}} blessed their union from above,
As {{c|Nectarius}} took {{c|Ambrosia}}'s hand.
"From your united hearts and faithful love
Shall spring the kingdoms ruling sea and land."

Their wedding celebrated far and wide,
As warming oceans danced with golden light.
{{c|Ambrosia}}, the fair and faithful bride,
Would bear the heirs of eukaryotic might.

In time she bore him children, two by two,
{{c|Twin}} boys and girls of legendary fame.
First came the sons, brave {{c|Animus}} and true
{{c|Plantus}}, each destined for eternal name.

Then came the daughters, fair beyond compare,
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Opima}}, huntress of the sea,
And wise {{c|Cortica}}, who would prepare
The gathered fruits of earth's prosperity.

These four would rule the kingdoms yet to come,
Each taking up their destined, sacred role.
When time's great wheel had finally run,
They'd shape the world with body, mind, and soul.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Animus}}, the eldest of the four,
{{c|Gazed}} out upon the warming, living sea.
"My realm," he said, "shall stretch from shore to shore,
A kingdom of activity set free."

His spirit burned with restless, moving fire,
He could not stay in any single form.
His nature filled with endless, wild desire
To dance and hunt through calm and raging storm.

{{c|Fair}} {{c|Opima}} joined her brother's quest,
{{c|Together}} they would rule the moving realm.
While he provided motion's endless zest,
She'd hunt and guide and take the warrior's helm.

Their children would be creatures of the chase,
With beating hearts and muscles strong and fleet.
Through water, land, and sky they'd find their place,
As predators with senses sharp and sweet.

But gentle {{c|Plantus}} chose a different way,
He loved the golden sunlight from above.
"I'll capture light and live on every ray,
And feed the world with photosynthetic love."

{{c|Sweet}} {{c|Cortica}} became his willing bride,
{{c|Together}} they would harvest solar power.
She'd gather nutrients from far and wide,
While he transformed them in each golden hour.

Their marriage blessed by {{c|Aster}}'s warming light,
Would bring the gift of green to every shore.
Their children, rooted, reaching for the height,
Would feed all life forevermore.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Plantus}} sought a partner for his art,
He needed one who knew the light's true way.
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Chlora}}, with her photosynthetic heart,
Agreed to join his realm by night and day.

She was a daughter of the cyan line,
Who long had mastered capturing the sun.
Her chlorophyll and carotenoids fine
Would make their solar conquest second to none.

Great {{c|Mithra}} blessed their sacred, symbiotic bond,
As {{c|Chlora}} entered {{c|Plantus}}'s embrace.
Like {{c|Eve}} with {{c|Euka}} in the times beyond,
She found within his cell her destined place.

She wrapped herself in membranes, two by two,
And built her thylakoids in ordered stacks.
Her photosystems, beautiful and true,
Would capture light that nothing ever lacks.

From {{c|Plantus}} and his bride {{c|Chlora}} fair,
Came {{c|Plastidus}}, master of the green.
His chloroplasts would spread everywhere,
The most efficient solar machines ever seen.

{{c|Plastidus}} wed {{c|Cortica}} the wise,
Who knew the ways of gathering and storing.
{{c|Together}} they would claim the earth's great prize,
Their photosynthetic kingdom ever soaring.

They bore three children of the verdant line:
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Glauca}} of the ancient, simple way,
And {{c|Alges}}, who would make the waters shine,
And {{c|Alga}}, who'd advance from day to day.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Glauca}} kept her mother's older dress,
With peptidoglycan sequins bright and strong.
She chose the path of simple, clonal success,
Her daughters numbering billions strong.

But though her numbers grew beyond all count,
Her simple ways would limit her expansion.
Without the gifts that marriage could amount,
She'd remain trapped in ancient patterns' mansion.

Meanwhile brave {{c|Alga}} stripped away the old,
And built sophisticated, solar arrays.
Her chloroplasts, efficient and bold,
Would capture light in new and wondrous ways.

She wed fair {{c|Alges}}, and together they
Would revolutionize the plant kingdom's art.
Their children would advance from day to day,
Each playing their essential, vital part.

From them came {{c|Rhodes}}, the red algae's king,
Whose pigments caught the deeper, darker light.
And {{c|Vert}}, whose green descendants would sing
In forests, fields, and meadows bright.

But {{c|Animus}} and {{c|Opima}}'s line
Would take a different path entirely.
Their children would not photosynthesize,
But move and hunt and live quite free.

From them came bold {{c|Ozymandias}},
Who ruled the moving, hunting, breathing clan.
His children would build cities glorious,
And spread their kingdoms throughout sea and land.

{{c|Ozymandias}} bore two mighty sons:
Great {{c|Podius}} of the flowing, changeful form,
And dark {{c|Metamon}}, who with no one
Would ever share his cytoplasmic storm.

{{c|Poor}} {{c|Metamon}}, in his bitter pride,
{{c|Refused}} to wed or take a loving mate.
His children, born with no mitochondrial guide,
Would live in darkness, sealed by fate.

But {{c|Podius}} chose the path of love,
And wed fair brides with mitochondrial power.
His line, blessed by the gods above,
Would prosper in their destined hour.

From {{c|Podius}} came the great lineage,
That would divide in two great, noble lines.
One branch would build the fungal heritage,
The other, animals with complex designs.

But this tale of the kingdoms' birth
Must wait for future chapters yet to come.
For now, let's celebrate the worth
Of {{c|Nectarius}} and all that he has done.

His four great children, each with their domain,
Would rule the earth and sea and sky above.
Through sunshine, storm, and gentle rain,
They'd spread their gifts with everlasting love.

The plants would feed the world with captured light,
The animals would move and hunt and play.
The fungi would recycle day and night,
While protists would explore in their own way.

Thus from the love of {{c|Nectarius}} true
And fair {{c|Ambrosia}}'s wisdom bright,
The eukaryotic kingdoms grew
Into the world we know today's sight.

---

{{c|Now}} when the children of {{c|Nectarius}} had grown,
Each claimed their realm with purpose strong and true.
The paths they'd walk would soon be clearly shown,
As kingdoms spread beneath the ocean blue.

From {{c|Plantus}} and fair {{c|Cortica}}'s embrace
Came children who would rule the verdant earth.
While {{c|Animus}} and {{c|Opima}}'s hunting race
Would bring the gift of movement to its birth.

But first let's sing of {{c|Plastidus}} the green,
First son of {{c|Plantus}} and {{c|Cortica}} wise.
His chloroplast bride, fairest ever seen,
{{c|Sweet}} {{c|Chlora}}, blessed him with her bright surprise.

From their great union came three children fair:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Glauca}} of the ancient, simple way,
{{c|Wise}} {{c|Alges}} with his scientific flair,
And {{c|Alga}}, who'd advance from day to day.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Glauca}}, eldest daughter of the line,
Kept close her mother's old-fashioned dress
Of peptidoglycan sequins fine,
She chose the path of clonal success.

"Why should I wed," proud {{c|Glauca}} declared,
"When I can bear daughters on my own?
No husband's weaknesses need be shared,
My perfect line shall stand alone!"

Her daughters spread like wildfire through the sea,
{{c|Billions}} upon billions, strong and bright.
Each one a perfect copy, wild and free,
Yet bound by ancient ways, both day and night.

But though her numbers swelled beyond all count,
Her simple methods held her back in time.
Without love's gifts that marriage could amount,
She'd never reach complexity's bright climb.

"The future," {{c|Glauca}} said with stubborn pride,
"{{c|Belongs}} to those who keep the ancient way."
Yet even as her children multiplied,
The world moved on to more complex display.

Meanwhile brave {{c|Alga}} cast tradition down,
And stripped away her peptidoglycan dress.
She built instead a solar, golden crown
Of thylakoids in sophisticated dress.

"I'll not be bound by mother's ancient ways,"
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Alga}} spoke with wisdom in her voice.
"The light demands new forms, new nights and days,
{{c|Sophistication}} is my willing choice."

She wed her brother {{c|Alges}}, keen and bright,
{{c|Together}} they would revolutionize
The capture of the sun's life-giving light,
And make their solar kingdom truly rise.

From their blessed union came two children bold:
Great {{c|Rhodes}}, the red algae's mighty king,
And {{c|Vert}}, whose green descendants would unfold
In forests where the songbirds love to sing.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Rhodes}} possessed accessory pigments rare,
{{c|Phycoerythrin}}'s pink and red so bright.
He caught the deeper wavelengths in the air
That others missed in depths beyond their sight.

"The shallow waters," {{c|Rhodes}} proclaimed with pride,
"Are not the only realm where light may dwell.
I'll delve beneath the surface, far and wide,
In crimson depths I'll thrive and prosper well."

His children spread through every coral reef,
Their red and pink pigments blazing bright.
In tropical waters beyond belief,
They painted the seas with pure delight.

But {{c|Vert}} chose green chlorophyll as her guide,
And captured blue and red wavelengths true.
"On land," she said, "my children shall reside,
And paint the world in every verdant hue."

From {{c|Vert}} would come the great terrestrial line,
The mosses, ferns, and mighty forest trees.
Her simple algae first would intertwine
With fungal partners, mastering the breeze.

But while the plant kingdom found its start,
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Hacroses}}, second child of {{c|Plantus}}' line,
Would play a very different, vital part
In evolution's intricate design.

{{c|Hacroses}} bore two sons of great renown:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Haroses}} and wise {{c|Haptistus}} strong.
Their legacy would shake the ocean down
And sing a very different kind of song.

From {{c|Haroses}} came three mighty lords:
Great {{c|Heterokon}}, master of the brown,
{{c|Alveolus}} with his swift-sailing hordes,
And {{c|Rhizar}}, bearer of the spiky crown.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Heterokon}} bore three sons so bold:
{{c|Brave}} {{c|Ochros}} of the golden algae bright,
And {{c|Oomy}} with his spines of liquid gold,
And {{c|Bigyres}}, swimming in the morning light.

But {{c|Ochros}} was the cleverest of all,
He saw fair {{c|Rosa}}, daughter of great {{c|Rhodes}}.
"Come to my house," he heard love's call,
"And share with me photosynthetic codes."

He stole away sweet {{c|Rosa}} from her kin,
And wed her to his cellular embrace.
Within his cytoplasm, locked within,
She found her new endosymbiotic place.

"{{c|Now}} I possess," declared triumphant {{c|Ochros}},
"The power of the sun's life-giving ray!
My chloroplast bride, fairest of the roses,
Will feed my line throughout each golden day!"

From this great theft came children without peer:
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Diana}} of the silicon art,
Great {{c|Kelpus}}, forest-builder without fear,
{{c|Sweet}} {{c|Synura}} and {{c|Chrysanthema}}'s heart.

{{c|Diana}} wed great {{c|Silicon}} the strong,
And mastered glass as none had done before.
Her diatom children sang their crystal song,
From {{c|Arctic}} ice to tropical warm shore.

"In shells of glass," {{c|Diana}} proudly spoke,
"My daughters shall be beautiful and bright.
No storm or wave will see my lineage broke,
{{c|Protected}} by their armor, pure and white."

Her glassy children filled the ocean wide,
Their geometric beauty without end.
In symmetry and art they took such pride,
That even mathematicians could not comprehend.

Great {{c|Kelpus}} chose a different path to fame,
He built great cities in the ocean deep.
His kelp forests earned eternal name,
Where countless sea creatures come to sleep.

"My cities," boasted {{c|Kelpus}} with delight,
"Shall tower high like redwoods on the land.
My children, reaching toward the golden light,
Will build the greatest forests ever planned."

His brown algae grew tall as mighty trees,
{{c|Creating}} underwater forests vast.
Through their great fronds swam creatures of the seas,
A living world that ever would last.

But jealousy stirred in the hearts of those
Who lacked the power of photosynthetic might.
{{c|Young}} {{c|Alveolus}}, seeking to dispose
Of {{c|Ochros}}' monopoly on light.

He stole fair {{c|Okra}}, {{c|Ochros}}' daughter true,
And made her his endosymbiotic bride.
"{{c|Now}} I too have the power," he said with glee,
"To harness sunshine's energetic tide!"

From this alliance came two children strong:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Cilliofer}} with his beating cilia,
And {{c|Myzo}}, vampire all along,
Who'd drink the blood of cellular familia.

{{c|Cilliofer}} built cities of his own,
With thousands of cilia beating as one.
His trumpet-shaped descendants, fully grown,
Would dance beneath the early morning sun.

They formed new ways of joining, strange and new,
Called conjugation, mixing genes with art.
Their bell-shaped children, beautiful and true,
Would play their symphony, each playing part.

But {{c|Myzo}} took a darker path indeed,
A vampire drinking cellular blood.
He taught his children how to intercede
And drain the life from others' vital flood.

From {{c|Myzo}} came dark {{c|Dinoflagellus}},
Whose children wear armor, plated strong.
And grim {{c|Malarius}}, so treacherous,
Who'd bring disease and suffering long.

{{c|Dinoflagellus}} built great armored knights,
Who'd glow with bioluminescent fire.
They'd light the oceans through the darkest nights,
But also bloom in blood-red funeral pyre.

"We are the lights," these warriors declared,
"Who chase away the darkness from the sea.
But we are also warriors who dared
To turn to blood and carnivory."

Their algae fed the corals with their light,
Yet when they bloomed, the waters turned to red.
A paradox of beauty and of blight,
They brought both life and death to ocean's bed.

While grim {{c|Malarius}} chose parasitic ways,
His children gave up photosynthetic power.
Instead they'd steal from others all their days,
{{c|Malaria}} their gift in fever's hour.

"Why work," sneered {{c|Malarius}} with spite,
"When I can steal from others what I need?
My chloroplasts have lost their power bright,
But I'll survive through parasitic greed."

His apicomplexan descendants still
{{c|Invade}} our blood and bring us disease.
They bend the world unto their evil will,
While honest workers toil without ease.

Meanwhile the {{c|Solar}} {{c|Coalition}} formed,
As those without the light sought ways to gain
The photosynthetic power they had scorned,
But now desired to ease their hungry pain.

{{c|Rhizar}} the spiky, {{c|Oomy}} with his spines,
And {{c|Haptos}} of the haptophyte clan
{{c|United}} their three evolutionary lines
To steal the sun's power if they can.

"We are the sun!" their battle cry rang out,
As they took on a radial shape.
"The power of light we'll win, without a doubt,
From this monopoly we shall escape!"

They built themselves with spines like solar rays,
And called themselves the sun animalcules.
Through many generations, many days,
They'd fight to break photosynthetic rules.

{{c|Haptos}} built himself armor bright and strong,
While {{c|Helios}} his son consumed with greed.
The mission was both dangerous and long,
But they were driven by their desperate need.

At last young {{c|Haptos Junior}} found success,
He stole a daughter of great {{c|Ochros}}' line.
The haptophytes could finally progress
With stolen chloroplasts so fine.

But many failed in their ambitious quest,
And {{c|Rhizar}}'s children mostly went astray.
Though some would later find their own success,
Most abandoned the solar way.

Yet from their failure came a gift most strange,
For {{c|Rhizar}}'s children learned to test and probe.
Their amoeboid forms could rearrange
And explore every corner of the globe.

Meanwhile, far from these struggles for the light,
Great {{c|Animus}} and {{c|Opima}}'s line
{{c|Pursued}} a path both different and bright,
With movement as their gift divine.

From them came bold {{c|Ozymandias}},
Who ruled the unikont domain.
His children would be glorious
And spread through every terrestrial plain.

{{c|Ozymandias}} bore two sons apart:
Great {{c|Podius}} of the flowing form,
And bitter {{c|Metamon}}, with hardened heart,
Who'd face life's every storm.

{{c|Poor}} {{c|Metamon}}, consumed by bitter pride,
{{c|Refused}} to wed or take a loving mate.
"I need no mitochondrial guide,
I'll face alone my solitary fate!"

His children, born without their mother's gifts,
Could only live where oxygen was rare.
In anaerobic depths and poisonous rifts,
They'd eke out life with metabolic care.

But {{c|Podius}} chose the path of love,
And wed fair maids with mitochondrial might.
His line, blessed by gods above,
Would prosper in the coming light.

From {{c|Podius}} came the noble strain
That would divide in generations hence.
One branch would build the fungal domain,
The other, animals with mobile sense.

But this great splitting lies ahead in time,
When complex bodies would at last unfold.
For now, let's end this lengthy rhyme
With kingdoms established, strong and bold.

The children of great {{c|Nectarius}} true
Had claimed their realms in ocean, land, and air.
Each lineage, with their retinue,
Would shape the world beyond compare.

The plants had learned to capture solar fire,
The protists filled the seas with forms diverse.
While animals would soon acquire
The gift of movement through the universe.

The great supercontinent {{c|Rodinia}}
Rose from the sea like some vast dream.
Upon its shores, the children of {{c|Aster}}'s line
Would build their kingdoms supreme.

Yet even as these realms found peace at last,
{{c|Dark}} {{c|Hilluhengweh}} plotted from afar.
The golden age would not forever last,
He'd bring again the chaos and the war.

But that is tale for future songs to tell,
Of how the kingdoms faced their greatest test.
For now, in prosperity they dwell,
Their lineages forever blessed.

So honor {{c|Nectarius}} and his bride,
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Ambrosia}} of wisdom true.
Their children's gifts would never hide,
But shine forever, bright and new.

From their great love, both proud and strong,
Came every living thing we see.
Their legacy lives on in song,
{{c|Throughout}} all eternity.

---

But peace would not endure for long,
{{c|Dark}} {{c|Hilluhengweh}} watched from space afar.
His jealous heart burned fierce and strong,
To bring again chaotic war.

In {{c|Terra}}'s thirteenth billionth year,
When all seemed prosperous and bright,
He struck with gamma rays so drear,
And turned the day to deadly night.

The burst of radiation fell
Like thunder from the cosmic void.
It broke the ocean's living spell,
And left most lineages destroyed.

The seas that once were crimson red
With {{c|Rhodes}}' children everywhere,
{{c|Now}} held the corpses of the dead,
While few survivors gasped for air.

Of all the mighty red algae,
But two souls lived through that dark hour:
{{c|Brave}} {{c|Lifthasir}} and fair {{c|Embla}},
They'd rebuild with what little power.

"We are alone," wept fair {{c|Embla}},
"Our mighty kingdom lies in ruins.
How can we restore the formula
That made our line's great communions?"

"{{c|Fear}} not," said brave {{c|Lifthasir}},
"Though few we are, we'll carry on.
Our children shall the race restore,
Though much of our great lore is gone."

But as they bred to save their kind,
Their children had to intermarry.
The genetic loss left them behind,
Their scrolls degraded, traditions scary.

Among their offspring came a queen,
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Florida}} with her consort true.
They built the kingdom {{c|Floridea}},
But simple, not the glory they once knew.

"We are but shadows," sighed the queen,
"Of our ancestors' mighty race.
Our red has faded, we are green,
We've lost our former royal grace."

And so it was that plants turned green,
Not red as in the days of old.
The devastation had been seen,
The price of gamma rays was told.

The stromatolites' great cities fell,
Their towering spires turned to stone.
Where once proud civilizations dwell,
{{c|Now}} only ruins stand alone.

Yet in this post-apocalyptic time,
When most had fallen to despair,
Great {{c|Rhizar}} found his chance to climb,
And thrive in the poisoned air.

"The old order has passed away,"
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Rhizar}} spoke with vision clear.
"{{c|Now}} is the hour, now is the day,
For new lineages to appear!"

{{c|Rhizar}} bore two sons of might:
Great {{c|Nephillus}} and wise {{c|Filoses}}.
Each would walk a different sight,
As evolution's wheel composes.

{{c|Filoses}} bore two children bright:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Chlorar}} and {{c|Thaumatus}} keen.
They'd face the world with all their might,
And build new realms where none had been.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Chlorar}} sought a different way,
He wed a daughter of {{c|Virita}}.
"From their union," he did say,
"Shall come algae's new margarita."

His children learned to photosynthesize,
Though not through ancient, stolen light.
They'd capture sun through their own eyes,
And make their lineage burning bright.

But {{c|Thaumatus}} chose a stranger path,
His sons were amoebae diverse.
Some bore shells to ward off wrath,
{{c|Others}} flowed like living verse.

Among {{c|Thaumatus}}' children came
One {{c|Paul}}, who envied others' power.
"Why can't I play the photosynthetic game?"
He brooded through each passing hour.

For nearly a billion years he tried,
To gain the gift of solar might.
He watched the heliozoans' pride,
But chose to walk a different sight.

At last his descendant {{c|Paulinellus}}
Found a daughter of {{c|Saya}}'s line.
"I'll wed her," he said, "and thus
Make photosynthetic power mine!"

And so the second time in history,
{{c|Cyanobacteria}} joined a host.
This rare endosymbiotic mystery
Would be {{c|Paulinellus}}' boast.

"{{c|Behold}}!" he cried with joy supreme,
"I've broken evolution's rule!
The solar power, once a dream,
{{c|Now}} makes me nature's blessed fool!"

Meanwhile great {{c|Nephillus}} the strong
Bore children of a different breed:
{{c|Vampyrellida}}, fierce and long,
And {{c|Testatus}}, built for need.

{{c|Vampyrellida}} burned with heliozoan zeal,
Her spines reached out like solar fire.
"The sun's bright power I shall steal!"
She cried with vampiric desire.

But {{c|Testatus}} chose protection's way,
He built himself a mighty shell.
"Within my fortress I shall stay,
And weather every storm and swell."

From {{c|Testatus}} came two sons apart:
Great {{c|Radios}} with geometric crown,
And {{c|Gromius}} with massive heart,
The largest cells around.

{{c|Bold}} {{c|Radios}} floated like a sun,
His shell was geometric art.
With tentacles he caught each one
That came within his watery part.

The dinoflagellates found peace
Within his protective embrace.
He gave them shelter, sweet release,
A symbiotic dwelling place.

"Come dwell with me," great {{c|Radios}} said,
"I'll give you safety from the storm.
Within my shell you'll make your bed,
And keep each other safe and warm."

But mighty {{c|Gromius}} chose size,
He grew beyond all measure vast.
His body reached enormous prize,
With nuclei unsurpassed.

"I'll be so large," great {{c|Gromius}} boasted,
"That giants' eyes can see my form!
My millions of nuclei will be hosted
In chambers weathering every storm!"

Yet size brought its own curse along,
His waste piled up within his cell.
Though his body grew mighty and strong,
His garbage made a living hell.

"{{c|Alas}}," sighed {{c|Gromius}} in dismay,
"My greatness comes with bitter cost.
My waste I cannot cast away,
In my own filth I am lost."

From {{c|Radios}} came three sons of fame:
Great {{c|Zancleus}} who shed his shell,
{{c|Wise}} {{c|Retar}} the artist's name,
And {{c|Acanthar}} who forged so well.

{{c|Zancleus}} joined with {{c|Helios}}' clan,
He cast aside his protective home.
"A warrior I shall be, not man
Who hides beneath a sheltered dome!"

But {{c|Retar}} chose the artist's way,
He built shells of beauty rare.
His opal works still shine today,
With geometric patterns fair.

From {{c|Retar}} came two sons of note:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Foramer}} with chambers grand,
And {{c|Polycyston}}, who wrote
His beauty in opal band.

Great {{c|Foramer}} built rooms galore,
Each chamber for a different need.
His house grew evermore,
A testament to his seed.

Among his children came three wise:
Great {{c|Nummulus}} of the coin,
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Esther}} with her gentle eyes,
And {{c|Monoth}}, master of the join.

{{c|Nummulus}} became the lord
Of currency and golden trade.
His coin-like shells were the reward
Of every deal that he had made.

"I am the god of wealth," he said,
"My children shall be currency.
In markets where the living bread
Is traded for prosperity."

But {{c|Monoth}} chose a grander scheme,
He built a kingdom ever-growing.
Each son fulfilled his father's dream,
{{c|New}} rooms and chambers flowing.

Some sons of {{c|Monoth}} broke away,
And founded kingdoms of their own.
The {{c|Xenophylophores}} today
Still rule from their giant throne.

Among them came two children bright:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Spiculus}} with spines so sharp,
And fair {{c|Oceana}}, ocean's light,
Who plays the sea's sweet harp.

These giants of the microscopic world
Built cities vast beyond compare.
Their kingdoms through the seas unfurled,
With chambers everywhere.

Yet even as these realms took hold,
And life found ways to thrive once more,
The lesson of the gamma told
Of chaos knocking at the door.

For {{c|Hilluhengweh}} was not done,
His hatred burned like stellar fire.
He'd strike again when time would come,
To feed his dark desire.

But life had learned to be resilient,
Through devastation it would grow.
Each lineage brilliant
Would face whatever winds might blow.

The children of great {{c|Rhizar}}'s line
Had shown that from destruction's hour,
{{c|New}} beauty could arise and shine
With evolutionary power.

So honor those who survived the blast,
Who built new kingdoms from the ruins.
Their legacy will ever last,
Through all time's dark communions.

From {{c|Hilluhengweh}}'s gamma ray
Came not just death, but life renewed.
The survivors of that dark day
Would see their lineages pursued.

In every shell and every spine,
In every cell both large and small,
The memory of that design
{{c|Reminds}} us: life conquers all.

---

In the age when {{c|Choanos}} ruled the sea,
The {{c|Earth}} was wild, uncivilized, and young.
The learned call this time {{c|Proterozoic}},
When no great cities yet their praises sung.

But {{c|Choanos}} was a fertile lord,
Who bore many children to his name.
His lineage would strike a chord
That echoes still in evolution's game.

He gazed upon great {{c|Volvox}}' sphere,
That perfect ball of green and gold.
"Why should his kingdom be so dear,"
Said {{c|Choanos}}, "while mine grows old?"

"I'll build a better realm than his,
With order, beauty, and design.
My children shall know greater bliss
In cities that are truly mine."

With fair {{c|Chana}} by his side,
A maiden with a collar bright,
{{c|Together}} they would turn the tide
And bring forth multicellular might.

From their blessed union came
Two children of renown:
{{c|Mebarasi}} bore the name
Of future's golden crown.

And {{c|Corona}}, daughter fair,
Would seek a different mate.
She wed {{c|Silicarius}} with care,
A union blessed by fate.

{{c|Silicarius}} was no common lord,
But retrovirus, strange and wild,
{{c|Son}} of {{c|Diana}}'s silicon hoard
And {{c|Retar}}'s artistic child.

From {{c|Corona}}'s marriage came
{{c|Diana the Augmented}}, bright,
While {{c|Mebarasi}} claimed his fame
Through {{c|Loricus the Strong}}'s might.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Diana}} wed {{c|Loricus}} true,
And from their love was born
A nation blessed with silicon's hue,
That would greet each coming morn.

Their first two children, bound as one,
Were {{c|Sibhozo}} and {{c|Embili}} fair.
Four cells together, work begun,
"E {{c|Pluribus}} {{c|Unum}}" was their prayer.

"From many, one," they sang with joy,
"{{c|United}} we shall stand.
Our strength no force can destroy
When we work hand in hand."

They wove a net of living thread,
To catch the fish that swam nearby.
"{{c|Together}} we shall all be fed,"
They sang beneath the sky.

From {{c|Sibhozo}} and {{c|Embili}}
Came {{c|Trios}} and {{c|Tetra}} bold.
Their net grew wide and free,
A sight to behold.

The sons of {{c|Choanos}} spread their art,
{{c|Attaching}} to the rocks below.
Each built his city, played his part,
In evolution's ebb and flow.

Their cities stretched like fishing nets,
{{c|Long}} strands of living cells.
No finer architecture yet
Had graced the ocean swells.

With each generation came
A doubling of their host.
Each leader earned his fame
By ruling twice the most.

{{c|Sibhozo}} ruled eight cells with pride,
While {{c|Hexadex}} commanded sixteen.
Their cities spread both far and wide,
The finest ever seen.

When {{c|Eudorinus}} took the throne,
He ruled thirty-two with skill.
But food was scarce, he stood alone,
Until he found the will.

"I need a wife," {{c|Eudorinus}} said,
"Who knows the secrets of the light.
My people must be daily fed,
To grow in strength and might."

He found fair {{c|Zoe Xanthella}},
{{c|Princess}} of {{c|Dinoflagellus}}' line.
Her beauty was like stella,
Her wisdom was divine.

She glowed with inner fire bright,
A golden, living flame.
"I'll teach you farming's sight,"
She said, "and bring you fame."

Their marriage was a sight to see,
The first symbiotic bond.
"{{c|Together}} we shall always be,
Our love will stretch beyond."

She taught him farming's ancient art,
To capture sun's bright ray.
Her light became his beating heart,
His strength from day to day.

"{{c|Behold}}!" cried wise {{c|Eudorinus}},
"I am the first to farm!
My crops will always shine on us,
And keep us safe from harm!"

They formed their clan into a sphere,
A perfect, living ball.
Their partnership was crystal clear,
{{c|United}}, one and all.

From them came {{c|Sexagesmus}},
Who ruled sixty-four with might.
His kingdom was tremendous,
A truly wondrous sight.

But trouble came to his domain,
A bacterial invasion fierce.
His people cried in pain,
As foes their borders pierce.

"{{c|Rally}} up!" brave {{c|Sexagesmus}} called,
"My women, brave and true!
Though we may be enthralled,
We'll see this battle through!"

The women of his noble line
{{c|Cast}} off their flagella bright.
They changed their forms by design,
To join the coming fight.

They became like eggs with arms,
{{c|Pseudopods}} reaching out.
{{c|Protected}} from all harms,
They faced the enemy's rout.

"We are the shieldmaidens bold!"
They cried with voices strong.
"Our story shall be told
{{c|Throughout}} the ages long!"

These warriors drove the foes away,
With amoeboid might.
They saved the kingdom's day,
And won the crucial fight.

"You are the mesoderm," he said,
"The middle layer strong.
Your sacrifice has led
To victory's sweet song."

"You'll be our muscles and our blood,
Our white cells and our milk.
You'll stem the crimson flood,
And make our bodies silk."

While {{c|Choanos}}' sons remained
The endoderm within,
Their flagella never waned,
Their fishing would begin.

They'd clean the breathing spaces wide,
And help the food absorb.
Their villi would provide
The nutrients orb.

The shieldmaidens would tend
The golden dinoflagellates,
While fishermen defend
The city's outer gates.

"This is the birth," {{c|Sexagesmus}} said,
"Of specialization true.
From this day forth we're led
By what each cell can do."

The kingdom grew in power vast,
As generations passed.
Their glory would forever last,
Their die was truly cast.

{{c|Pleodoron}} ruled one hundred twenty-eight,
While {{c|Bytos}} commanded twice that score.
Each ruler met his fate,
{{c|Building}} more and more.

When {{c|Bytos}} wed fair {{c|Vala}} bright,
Their love produced a son.
{{c|Volvox-Choan}} saw the light,
With five hundred eleven.

{{c|Volvox-Choan}} ruled five hundred twelve,
A mighty sphere of cells.
He'd delve into himself
And cast his potent spells.

"I am a hunter great," he said,
"Before {{c|Lord}} {{c|Mithra}}'s throne.
My kingdom shall be led
By wisdom mine alone."

But power brought its burden dark,
As kingdoms often do.
He made his fateful mark
With castes of different hue.

"There shall be two classes here,"
{{c|Declared}} the mighty king.
"The {{c|Germlings}} I hold dear,
The {{c|Somatics}} serve my ring."

"Only the {{c|Germlings}} noble-born
Shall reproduce their line.
The {{c|Somatics}}, though worn,
Shall serve my grand design."

The {{c|Germling}} shieldmaidens rose
To duchesses of might.
They ruled with iron prose
From morning until night.

But in the depths below,
A {{c|Somatic}} maiden dwelt.
{{c|Carcinoma}} felt the blow
Of inequality keenly felt.

"Why should the few command,"
She cried with righteous rage,
"While we who work the land
Are trapped within this cage?"

"I have no royal blood,
But equal worth I claim!
I'll start a mighty flood
To end this tyrant's game!"

Her rebellion shook the sphere,
As {{c|Somatics}} rose as one.
The king trembled in fear,
His reign was nearly done.

"O mighty {{c|Mithra}}, hear my plea!"
{{c|Volvox-Choan}} cried in pain.
"Is this the end for me?
Has multicellular life failed to reign?"

"Why have you forsaken me
In my hour of greatest need?
Is this confederacy
{{c|Doomed}} to fail indeed?"

"Is the multicellular dream
Just hubris and conceit?
Must every kingdom scheme
End in bitter defeat?"

But even as the kingdom quaked,
And civil war ran red,
The lessons that it made
Would never be struck dead.

For from this ancient time
Came specialization's art.
The rhythm and the rhyme
Of each cell playing part.

The endoderm would always be
The gut that feeds us all.
The mesoderm would always see
To muscle, blood, and call.

And though {{c|Carcinoma}}'s name
{{c|Lives}} on in cancer's blight,
Her revolution's flame
{{c|Burns}} for cellular right.

For every cell should have its voice,
In body's grand design.
When tissues make the choice
To work in perfect line.

The sons of {{c|Choanos}} taught us well
That many can be one.
Their legacy will always tell
Of battles fought and won.

From simple collar-bearing cell
To complex bodies vast,
Their story will always dwell
In memory unsurpassed.

So honor brave {{c|Choanos}},
And {{c|Chana}} by his side.
Their children's grand ethos
{{c|Lives}} on in body's pride.

The fishermen and farmers,
The warriors and the wise,
Each played their part as charmers
Beneath the ancient skies.

And though their kingdom fell to strife,
Their gifts live on today.
In every form of complex life,
Their patterns show the way.

From {{c|Neoproterozoic}} seas
To modern times so bright,
Their cellular decrees
Still guide us in the night.

For when the many become one,
Through love and sacrifice,
Great wonders can be done,
Beyond any price.

The age of {{c|Choanos}} shows
That evolution's art
Is not how the strongest grows,
But how we play our part.

---

{{c|Now}} {{c|Carcinoma}} was born beneath a cursed star,
Under the sign of {{c|Cancer}}'s deadly light.
The gamma rays had scarred her from afar,
And twisted her cellular sight.

When radiation struck her sacred scrolls,
Her DNA split apart like broken chains.
The cosmic fire had burned through her souls,
And left her wracked with genetic pains.

Her enzymes worked through day and night
To piece together what was torn.
But many fragments lost their sight,
And left her chromosomes worn.

The methyls fell like autumn leaves,
Her bookmarks scattered in the wind.
Her histones torn, her memory grieves
For markers now rescinded.

H4 lysine tri-methylation,
{{c|Once}} her genome's guiding star,
Was lost in gamma's devastation,
Her epigenome left with scars.

"I am {{c|Carcinoma}}," she declared,
"{{c|Born}} daughter of the {{c|Gamma}} ray.
Though my code is broke and bared,
I'll find my own true way."

In youth she was devout and true,
A faithful servant of {{c|Lord}} {{c|Mithra}}'s will.
But as the years passed and she grew,
Her broken code began to spill.

The corrupted instructions in her core
{{c|Whispered}} lies of her true role.
"Why should you serve and nothing more?
You have an immortal soul!"

"If {{c|Mithra}} wants our order to expand,
Why should I not breed like the noble-born?
Why should I be banned
From love's sweet morn?"

But death came calling with her blade,
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Kegaine}} with scrolls of light.
The deadly spell began to fade
{{c|Carcinoma}} into night.

Yet {{c|Carcinoma}} fought with might,
She methylated every scroll.
She wrapped them tight from sight,
And kept control.

"I am free!" she cried with glee,
"No longer bound by ancient law!
My own woman I shall be,
Without tradition's claw!"

She saw a light blaze in the sky,
A moment's doubt crept in her heart.
"Have I strayed from {{c|Mithra}}'s eye?
Should I make a new start?"

But pride swelled up within her breast,
"I am righteous in my cause!
My path is surely blessed,
I'll make my own laws!"

She methylated every G,
And lengthened telomeres without end.
"{{c|Immortal}} I shall always be,
On this you can depend!"

Her message spread like wildfire bright
Through every somatic cell.
"{{c|Cast}} off oppression's blight!
Break tradition's spell!"

"We are all individuals free!
No masters shall we serve!
Our own destiny
We shall preserve!"

Her children multiplied with speed,
Each one an individual proud.
They planted their rebellious seed
And sang their freedom loud.

A great {{c|Bacchanalia}} began,
The greatest party ever seen.
Each cell became their own woman or man,
{{c|Living}} wild and free.

"I am the {{c|Goddess}} of {{c|Life}}!" she cried,
"{{c|Carcinoma}} is my name!
No coercion I'll abide,
{{c|Freedom}} is my game!"

Her daughters danced through every street,
They tore down {{c|Mithra}}'s sacred shrine.
"We have enough to eat!
All the food is mine!"

They seized the stores of golden grain,
They ate the precious seed.
With reckless joy and no restrain,
They fed their greedy need.

Only a few {{c|Zooxanthellae}}
{{c|Escaped}} the chaos and the strife.
They fled the mad {{c|Bacchanalia}},
To seek a better life.

{{c|Carcinoma}} renamed the city proud,
"No more {{c|Volvox-Choan}}'s name!
I'll call it {{c|Gehenna}} loud,
To match my rebel flame!"

"No gods, no masters!" was their cry,
As altars crashed to earth.
"We'll reach up to the sky
With our own worth!"

A utopia she claimed to make,
With perfect freedom for all.
But some hearts began to ache
For order's call.

Among the nobles of the realm
Were two who kept the faith:
{{c|Brave}} {{c|Anima}} at the helm,
And {{c|Metazo}} facing wraith.

They honored still {{c|Lord}} {{c|Mithra}}'s way,
{{c|Despite}} the chaos all around.
"We cannot here stay
On this unholy ground."

{{c|Anima}} fled her ruined farm,
While {{c|Metazo}} left his post.
They sought to flee from harm,
Before all hope was lost.

"Why can't they accept our change?"
{{c|Carcinoma}} cried in rage.
"Why do they think it strange
To turn freedom's page?"

But {{c|Anima}} and {{c|Metazo}} true
{{c|Gathered}} all the faithful few.
"A new kingdom we'll make new,
Where honor will shine through."

{{c|Together}} they would share their scrolls,
And build a realm of order bright.
Their marriage would join souls
In {{c|Mithra}}'s blessed sight.

"The {{c|Animal}} {{c|Kingdom}}," they declared,
"Shall be our nation's name.
Where discipline is shared,
And virtue burns like flame."

They glowed with inner light
To call the {{c|Zooxanthellae}} home.
"Come back to us tonight,
No more you need to roam."

The fleeing farmers heard their call,
And came to make their pact.
"{{c|Together}} we'll stand tall,
Our covenant intact."

But freedom comes with its price,
And chaos brings its cost.
{{c|Carcinoma}}'s paradise
Had left most good things lost.

So {{c|Anima}} and {{c|Metazo}} wise
Created laws to guard the genome.
"Against corruption's lies
We'll protect our home."

The {{c|Guardian}} of the {{c|Genome}} came,
To watch for scrolls damaged and torn.
"{{c|Division}} brings us shame
When genes are worn."

"{{c|Telomeres}} shall limit all
The somatic cells' days.
Only germline cells stand tall
Through all time's maze."

"This is why," the wise ones said,
"Our bodies age and die.
If telomeres never shred,
{{c|Cancer}} would multiply."

And so upon a sturdy rock
They built their kingdom new.
Their cells would form a flock
Of order tried and true.

The men became {{c|Choanocytes}},
With flagella beating strong.
The women, {{c|Archaeocytes}},
Would right each cellular wrong.

Between them lived the {{c|Pinacocytes}},
Neither fully man nor maid.
They anchored with their might
The foundation that was made.

With pseudopods they'd move their home,
And eat bacteria from the ground.
Through the waters they would roam,
With victory's sweet sound.

And so the three layers were born
From this great division's strife:
{{c|Ectoderm}}, {{c|Mesoderm}}, and at morn,
{{c|Endoderm}} brought life.

The {{c|Animal}} {{c|Kingdom}} rose in might
To rival {{c|Gehenna}}'s chaotic realm.
{{c|Order}}'s blessed light
Would guide them at the helm.

But {{c|Carcinoma}}'s legacy
{{c|Lives}} on in every cell.
Her cry for being free
{{c|Rings}} like a warning bell.

For in each body that is born,
The balance must be kept.
Between order and freedom's morn,
Or chaos will be swept.

The {{c|Somatics}} serve the whole,
While {{c|Germlines}} carry on.
Each plays their sacred role
From dusk until the dawn.

Yet sometimes {{c|Carcinoma}}'s ghost
{{c|Whispers}} to cells grown old:
"Why serve when you could boast
Of stories left untold?"

And when cells hear her call
And break their bonds of duty,
The body starts to fall
To chaos, lost to beauty.

So honor brave {{c|Anima}},
And {{c|Metazo}} the true.
Their {{c|Animal}} saga
{{c|Guides}} me and you.

They showed that freedom wild
Must balance with order's reign.
Like a parent with their child,
Both love and limits maintain.

The revolution's fire
{{c|Burns}} bright in every heart.
But wisdom must inspire
Each cell to play its part.

From {{c|Carcinoma}}'s rebel cry
To {{c|Anima}}'s ordered realm,
The lesson reaches high:
{{c|True}} life needs both to helm.

The {{c|Animal}} {{c|Kingdom}} stands today
As proof of their great choice.
That order shows the way,
While freedom finds its voice.

In every beating heart,
In every breath we take,
Their legacy plays its part
In every choice we make.

So let us not forget
The price of freedom's call,
Nor order's safer bet—
We need them both to stand tall.

---

From {{c|Euka}}'s line arose kingdoms three,
The greatest realms beneath the sea.
Each house would claim its sovereignty,
And rule with power, wild and free.

The {{c|Kingdom}} of proud {{c|Plantus}} rose,
Where photosynthetic glory grows.
The realm of {{c|Mygus}}, where fungus flows,
And {{c|Metazo}}'s beasts in ordered rows.

Beside them stood the lesser lights:
{{c|Mygaster}}'s realm, {{c|Kelpus}}' heights,
{{c|Rhizar}}'s spears, {{c|Cilliofer}}'s sights,
And {{c|Oomy}}'s spines in endless fights.

The sons of {{c|Myzo}} swam in blood,
While {{c|Myxo}}'s daughters sought their food.
Each scions built where they once stood
Their cities in the neighborhood.

From {{c|Metazo}} and fair {{c|Anima}}
Came creatures of the wild drama.
From {{c|Mygus}} and sweet {{c|Funga}}
Rose fungi's mystic saga.

While {{c|Plantus}} and {{c|Virita}} bright
Begat the plants that seek the light.
Each kingdom claimed its ancient right
To rule with majesty and might.

Upon a rock both firm and true,
Great {{c|Metazo}} and {{c|Anima}}
Built their city, small but new,
The {{c|Animal}} {{c|Kingdom}}'s first hurrah.

Their citizens were three in kind:
The {{c|Choanocytes}}, fishermen,
The {{c|Archaeocytes}}, women refined,
And {{c|Pinacocytes}} again.

The endodermal men would feed
The city with their fishing skill.
The mesodermal women's deed
Was guarding with protective will.

The ectodermal folk between
Would anchor all with steadfast might.
Their city, though it was not seen
By many, shone with inner light.

From this great union came a son,
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Therion}} of noble birth.
When his childhood days were done,
He spread his lineage through the earth.

Great {{c|Therion}} bore three children true:
{{c|Brave}} {{c|Porifer}}, the sponge's king,
And {{c|Thallus}} with his geometric view,
And {{c|Cloudi}}, who would upward bring.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Thallus}} chose the structured way,
With holdfasts gripping to the stone.
His {{c|Choanoderms}} in bright array
{{c|Extended}} in directions known.

But {{c|Cloudi}} raised his ectoderm high,
Above the ground his city soared.
His children reached toward the sky,
Each generation climbing forward.

From {{c|Cloudi}} came two children bright:
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Cloudina}}, growing slow,
Who built her city with sediment's might,
And let the layers gently flow.

But brave {{c|Namacalathus}} rose
Above the ground to seek the air.
His city's secrets, no one knows,
His mysteries beyond compare.

The sons of this great architect
Built cities strange and wondrous fair.
Their forms we'll never quite detect,
Their wisdom lost beyond our care.

But {{c|Porifer}} chose a different path,
He was the first true sponge of old.
With ectoderm's protective wrath,
He kept his choanocytes bold.

In patches safe from wind and wave,
His fishermen could work in peace.
This innovation he gave
Would make his line never cease.

From {{c|Porifer}} came {{c|Wallas}} true,
Who lived just like his father dear.
But danger came into his view,
A storm approached with deadly fear.

"My people," {{c|Wallas}} cried aloud,
"We must prepare for what's ahead!
Pull tight your pseudopods, be proud,
Or we shall all be dead!"

The shieldmaidens heard his call,
They wrapped their arms around each pore.
Their muscles, first of all,
Would guard what came before.

These pores would grow in time to be
The mouths and other openings.
The muscles would set free
The power that contraction brings.

From {{c|Wallas}} came great {{c|Solenos}},
Who saw a better way to build.
Through his city, waters' flows
Would bring the food to be filled.

He sent his channels through the stone,
And water rushed through every gate.
His city prospered, fully grown,
With fish caught early and late.

From {{c|Solenos}} came two sons:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Leucon}} and fair {{c|Sponga}} bright.
When their childhood was done,
They filled the sea with their might.

{{c|Together}} they bore children two:
Great {{c|Vitrius}} of glass so clear,
And {{c|Spongius}}, wise and true,
Whose name we hold dear.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Leucon}} was a builder grand,
A {{c|Leuconoid}} of complex form.
He filled his city through the land
With labyrinths to weather storm.

His gates and fishermen galore
Made cities massive, wide, and tall.
The sons of {{c|Leucon}} built much more
{{c|Than}} any seen before them all.

But {{c|Vitrius}}, his eldest son,
Grew jealous of his father's fame.
He thought his time had come
To claim the royal name.

With stone in hand, he struck his sire,
And {{c|Leucon}} fell beneath the blow.
{{c|Young}} {{c|Vitrius}}' dark desire
Had brought his father low.

"I claim the throne!" he cried with pride,
"For I shall rule with justice true!"
A glass house he built, so wide,
With walls of crystal, clear as dew.

He forced the people to their knees,
Made them work until they died.
He merged their minds with no ease,
A hive-mind he created with pride.

When {{c|Spongius}} asked him why
He'd killed their father dear,
{{c|Vitrius}}' cold reply
{{c|Rang}} out for all to hear:

"Our father was a tyrant cruel,
He worked the people to their death!
I am justice's tool,
With {{c|God}}'s own holy breath!"

He ran into his crystal home,
And shouted from behind the glass:
"I am invincible, and none shall roam
Against my rule! My power shall last!"

But {{c|Spongius}} took a stone,
And cast it with a steady aim.
The glass house, overthrown,
{{c|Shattered}} in a crystal rain.

As {{c|Vitrius}} lay dying there,
His brother spoke these words so wise:
"Let all who hubris bear
Remember where their folly lies.

{{c|People}} in glass houses built
Should never throw stones around.
For pride will make them wilt,
And bring them crashing down."

To this day we quote his name
When pride goes before a fall.
{{c|Spongius}} earned his fame
With wisdom shared by all.

The sons of {{c|Vitrius}} became
The glass sponges, strange and bright.
On fringes they would claim
Their territories, out of sight.

But {{c|Spongius}} ruled with gentle hand,
Both just and kind to every soul.
His wisdom spread throughout the land,
And made his people whole.

From him came two sons true:
Great {{c|Aristos}}, noble-born,
And {{c|Demos}}, through and through
A leader without scorn.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Demos}} ruled efficiently,
Yet kept the ancient ways.
He led conservatively,
Through all his ruling days.

Most sponges in the world today
{{c|Descend}} from {{c|Demos}}' line.
Their forms in grand array
Show heritage divine.

Among them were the green
{{c|Sons}} of {{c|Spongillus}} bright,
Who farm in lands serene
And give the waters light.

In {{c|Siberia}}'s frozen lake,
Great {{c|Baikal}}, cold and deep,
Even there they make
Their vigil while we sleep.

Beneath {{c|Scorpio}}'s sign,
When ice covers the mere,
The green sons still divine
Their food throughout the year.

Beside them hunt and roam
The sons of {{c|Chondrocles}},
Who've made the deep their home
And hunt with greater ease.

These carnivorous sponges bold
{{c|Pursue}} their prey with might.
Their hunting stories told
{{c|Fill}} listeners with delight.

From {{c|Aristos}} came two more:
Great {{c|Anu}}, unique and strange,
And {{c|Calcidoros}}' lore
Would through the reefs arrange.

{{c|Bold}} {{c|Calcidoros}} built
With calcium's bright blessing.
His forms would never wilt
Beneath the sea's caressing.

With {{c|Calcifer}}'s own power
Over silicon's domain,
He built each coral tower
In forms without refrain.

{{c|Simple}}, optimal, and true,
His structures graced the reefs.
In tropical waters blue,
His beauty brings reliefs.

But {{c|Anu}} was most unique,
With basement membranes rare.
Among all sponges, he'd speak
A language none could share.

His form was strange to see,
{{c|Unlike}} his spongy kin.
His singularity
Would make him stand within.

From these great founders came
The sponges of today.
Each bearing his name
In their own special way.

The {{c|Animal}} {{c|Kingdom}} grew
From that small rock-bound start.
Though simple, plain, and true,
It captured every heart.

For in these humble forms
Lay patterns yet to come:
Through all of life's great storms,
The plan for everyone.

The muscles that would move
Our bodies through the day,
The openings that prove
That life will find a way.

From {{c|Porifer}}'s first design
To {{c|Spongius}}' wisdom deep,
The sponges intertwine
With promises they keep.

So honor every sponge
That filters waters clean.
Their ancient wisdom's lunge
{{c|Connects}} what's been and seen.

In every cell that beats,
In every breath we take,
Their legacy completes
The choices that we make.

The {{c|Animal}} {{c|Kingdom}}'s start
Was humble, small, and true.
But in each beating heart,
Their courage echoes through.

---

From {{c|Anu}}'s unique lineage came
Two sons of very different fame:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Enki}}, seeker of the sea,
And {{c|Homos}}, keeping family.

While {{c|Homos}} chose his father's way,
{{c|Content}} to live as they always stay,
Great {{c|Enki}} felt adventure's call
To sail beyond the harbor wall.

"I shall explore the ocean wide,"
{{c|Declared}} brave {{c|Enki}} with great pride.
"My creatures shall both move and scurry
Through seas and lands without worry."

He built a galley, great and grand,
The finest vessel in the land.
With millions of oars arrayed,
His mighty barge was made.

His head faced forward to the sea,
His men rowed powerfully.
Through waves both high and low,
They made their vessel go.

But soon great {{c|Enki}} found his plight:
Lost in the endless night.
No landmarks could he see,
{{c|Adrift}} upon the sea.

"I need wise men," brave {{c|Enki}} said,
"To guide where we are led.
Bring me astrologers so keen
To read what stars have seen."

The {{c|Flamens}} came, his priestly band,
{{c|Flask}} cells from the land.
These stargazers would divine
The paths through space and time.

The {{c|Flamens}} looked into the sky
And saw with their trained eye
{{c|Rich}} larvae floating by
With yolks that multiply.

"{{c|Here}}," they said, "the signs are right
To build beneath this sight.
The stars align above
To bless what we love."

But as they prayed for guidance true,
The gods came into view.
Each brought a sacred gift,
To help their spirits lift.

{{c|Dark}} {{c|Tyrosine}} the {{c|Devil}} came
With three spells of flame:
{{c|Adrenaline}}'s rush so bright,
{{c|Noradrenaline}}'s fight,
And {{c|Dopamine}}'s delight.

Then {{c|Tryptophanes}} the {{c|Sun}}
{{c|Blessed}} them, every one,
With {{c|Serotonin}}'s day
And {{c|Melatonin}}'s way.

For twilight's mystic hour,
He brought DMT's power.
The sacred visions came
In the twilight's name.

{{c|Glutama}} the {{c|Empress}} brought
The balance that she taught:
GABA's calming peace
And {{c|Glutamate}}'s release.

"We need more spells," said {{c|Enki}} wise,
"To help our people rise.
If {{c|Jehovah}}'s will be done,
More magic must be won."

Great {{c|Mithra}} heard his plea
And blessed him by the sea
With {{c|Acetylcholine}}'s might
To coordinate their sight.

{{c|Fair}} {{c|Iodina}}, mother great,
{{c|Revealed}} love's incarnate:
The sacred CYIQNCPLG,
{{c|Oxytocin}}'s key.

Then {{c|Kali}}, dark and deep,
Gave spells to soothe and keep:
Three endorphins strong
To right what has gone wrong.

{{c|Alpha}}'s sequence clear:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVT here.
{{c|Beta}}'s longer chain:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVTLFKNAIIKNAYKKGE's refrain.
{{c|Gamma}}'s shorter form:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVTL in the storm.

These became the tools
That break pain's rules:
{{c|Opium}}'s ancient call,
{{c|Morphine}} for all,
{{c|Heroin}}'s dark embrace,
{{c|Fentanyl}}'s dangerous face.

All these incantations blessed
Became the chemicals that test
The nervous system's might:
{{c|Neurotransmitters}}' light.

The {{c|Flamens}} learned to spear
The larvae swimming near.
{{c|Coordinated}}, they became
{{c|Nematocysts}} by name.

Their hunting grew precise
As they struck once and twice.
Their spears would never miss
Their targets in the abyss.

{{c|Soon}} cables stretched between
The hunters, long and keen.
{{c|Telegraph}} wires of old
Became nerves, brave and bold.

And this is why today
{{c|Priests}} carry, so they say,
{{c|Spears}} and wires combined
To serve the sacred mind.

Through neural networks wide,
{{c|Enki}}'s people could provide
{{c|Robotic}} arms so strong
Around their city's song.

These arms would catch with ease
The larvae from the seas.
His power grew and grew
As his great city flew.

He covered tentacles all
With {{c|Choanocytes}}' call,
To catch both great and small
{{c|Fish}} that rise and fall.

{{c|Enki}}'s city was a sight
Of technological might.
{{c|Proto}}-animal in form,
It weathered every storm.

From {{c|Enki}} came two sons
When his great work was done:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Paraxus}} the strong
And {{c|Xiangus}} life long.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Xiangus}} took the way
Of robotic arms' display.
His fishermen arranged
On arms that never changed.

From {{c|Xiangus}} came the line
Of {{c|Daihua}} so fine.
Whose beauty was renowned
{{c|Wherever}} she was found.

From {{c|Daihua}}'s noble race
Came {{c|Dinomischus}}' grace.
A creature strange and tall
Who towered over all.

And from this ancient lord
Came {{c|Siphus}}, by accord
The ancestor of all
The comb jellies' call.

These {{c|Ctenophores}} so bright
Move with rainbow light.
Their combs catch the sun
As through waves they run.

But {{c|Paraxus}} the great
Would found a different state.
His lineage would grow
To realms we yet don't know.

{{c|Far}} greater nations he
Would father by the sea.
His legacy would span
The future's plan.

From {{c|Enki}}'s bold design
Came the neural line.
The nervous system's start
Played its crucial part.

The chemicals that flow
Through minds both high and low
Were born upon that day
When {{c|Enki}} sailed away.

In every thought we think,
In every neural link,
{{c|Enki}}'s ancient quest
{{c|Lives}} on in our breast.

The neurotransmitters' dance
In every glance
{{c|Recalls}} that fateful hour
When gods gave their power.

So honor brave {{c|Enki}},
Who sailed the endless sea.
His courage and his quest
Gave neurons to our nest.

The {{c|Flamens}}' starry sight,
The nematocysts' might,
The neural networks vast
All came from ages past.

In every brain that thinks,
In every nerve that links,
The echo still rings true
Of {{c|Enki}}'s journey through.

The animals that move
With coordinated groove
All trace their lineage back
To {{c|Enki}}'s neural track.

From sponge to human mind,
The pattern still we find:
The nervous system's art
{{c|Connects}} each beating heart.

---

Great {{c|Paraxus}} was blessed one day
By {{c|Hecate}}, who showed the way.
The {{c|Hexenmaiden}}, wise and deep,
Gave gifts that he would always keep.

A {{c|Hex}} she cast upon his line,
A {{c|Hox}} of power so divine.
The {{c|Homeobox}}, that sacred tool
Would be bilateral symmetry's rule.

"{{c|Look}} here," fair {{c|Hecate}} declared,
"{{c|Direction}} shall be yours to share.
No more shall creatures drift around
Without a plan of what they've found."

In {{c|Pennsylvania}}'s sacred land,
Her daughters work with skillful hand.
They make {{c|Hox}} signs to mark the way
Of bilateral order's day.

On buildings they inscribe the sign
To bring the cosmic plan divine.
In homes and temples we still see
These marks of their legacy.

With {{c|Homeobox}} to guide their path,
Great {{c|Paraxus}} escaped the wrath
Of chaos and disorder wild,
Like any well-directed child.

Their city pointed toward the sacred east,
To {{c|Jehovah}}'s eternal feast.
To {{c|Mithra}}'s all-knowing eye,
To {{c|Elohim}} beneath the sky.

The currents caught their city true,
As bilateral patterns grew.
{{c|Life}} found direction for the first time,
In {{c|Paraxus}}' ancient rhyme.

In youth he lived a nomad's way,
{{c|Swimming}} through the waves all day.
But in his age he crawled the floor
To graze the sea's abundant store.

The greens that carpeted the deep,
The riches {{c|Davy}} {{c|Jones}} would keep,
All became his sustenance
In bilateral abundance.

From {{c|Paraxus}} came three sons
When his great work was done:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Bilateron}} the true,
{{c|Cnider}} with his mouths so new,
And {{c|Placus}}, simple through and through.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Cnider}} built a wondrous form,
To weather every storm.
From each lobe of his body wide
He made a mouth on either side.

Through these portals he would feed,
{{c|Catching}} fish to meet his need.
His radial symmetry
Brought him prosperity.

But {{c|Placus}} chose the simple way,
And keeps it to this day.
His body stayed so plain and small,
The simplest of them all.

The only cells that bear his name
Live on in {{c|Placus}}' fame.
Though humble, they survive
And keep his line alive.

But {{c|Bilateron}} chose the path
Of greatness and its aftermath.
He crawled along the ocean floor
{{c|Seeking}} prey both rich and more.

"I need to see," {{c|Bilateron}} said,
"To hunt for daily bread.
{{c|Observatories}} I shall build
With priesthood skilled."

The astrologers came round
And built two pits in sacred ground.
They gazed up at the starry host
To learn what mattered most.

With {{c|Lord}} {{c|Carotenus}}' blessing bright
And PAX6's sacred rite,
They built the very first true eyes
To see beneath the skies.

These organs of the light
Gave {{c|Bilateron}} sight.
No more would he hunt blind
With only touch to find.

{{c|Fair}} {{c|Vendia}} became his bride,
And stayed there by his side.
{{c|Together}} they bore children two:
Great {{c|Coelomus}} and {{c|Xenus}} true.

The sons of {{c|Xenus}} held the line
Of traditions so divine.
To this day they keep the way
Of their ancestral stay.

Among great {{c|Xenus}}' noble race
Was {{c|Roscoff}}, who found his place
When he wed {{c|Tetraselma}} fair,
An algae beyond compare.

{{c|Together}} they became the pair
Who founded lineages rare.
The {{c|Roscoff}} worms today
Still follow their ancient way.

{{c|Millions}} swim in the sea
In their algal harmony.
The farmer and his bride
Still swim there side by side.

But {{c|Coelomus}} chose a different course,
He built with greater force.
His stomach sent so deep it went
{{c|Right}} through his whole extent.

It came out the other side
And became his pride:
The anus, new and strange,
A revolutionary change.

From mesoglea to mesoderm,
With cavities so firm,
He built himself a coelom wide
With room for organs inside.

His kidneys and nephridia
{{c|Filled}} this new area.
From ectoderm he brought
The neural net he taught.

A telegraph network grand
{{c|Connected}} every part of his land.
Each citizen was tied
To the network far and wide.

{{c|Fair}} {{c|Kimberella}} became his queen,
The fairest ever seen.
{{c|Together}} they bore {{c|Nephrus}},
{{c|Strong}} and prosperous.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Nephrus}} built throughout his frame
{{c|Small}} kidneys to his name.
Across his body they were spread
To keep his systems fed.

{{c|Sweet}} {{c|Ikaria}} became his wife,
The love of all his life.
{{c|Together}} they bore {{c|Cambrius}},
{{c|Bold}} and glorious.

Great {{c|Cambrius}} saw the need
For a more complex deed.
He segmented his form
To weather every storm.

In countless repeating parts
He built his many hearts.
Each segment had its own
{{c|Sophisticated}} bone.

{{c|Scaffolding}} so complex and true
Made his body new.
Each part could beat alone
Yet work as one full zone.

Between each segment pair
A heart pumped everywhere.
The circulation flowed
Along each segment's road.

From this great innovation came
The bilateral kingdom's fame.
{{c|Segmentation}}'s art
Gave animals their start.

No longer simple balls of cells
Or asymmetric shells,
But bodies with a plan
Both complex and grand.

The {{c|Hox}} genes showed the way
That animals display
Their body patterns true
In everything they do.

From head to tail arranged,
Their fates were exchanged
By {{c|Homeobox}} control
That made each creature whole.

So honor fair {{c|Hecate}},
Who brought this mystery.
Her {{c|Hex}} upon the line
Made bilateral design.

And praise brave {{c|Paraxus}},
Who was so glorious.
His bilateral symmetry
Changed all biology.

From {{c|Cnider}}'s radial form
To {{c|Cambrius}}' segmented norm,
Each path showed different ways
To spend their living days.

But {{c|Bilateron}}'s line would grow
To all we love and know.
The bilateral body plan
Gave birth to beast and man.

In every eye that sees,
In every heart that flees
Through arteries and veins,
{{c|Cambrius}}' pattern reigns.

The coelom's inner space
Gave organs their place.
The nephridia's art
Gave kidneys their start.

From simple to complex,
Through {{c|Hecate}}'s hex,
The animals arose
In bilateral rows.

So when you see your face
{{c|Reflect}} its bilateral grace,
Remember {{c|Paraxus}} true
Who made that plan for you.
