As sons of {{c|Chordatus}} grew
Their bloodlines strong and true,
And {{c|Annelon}}'s children spread
Their segments widespread,

The sons of {{c|Ambulus}} sought
The greatness they had fought
To achieve through patient art
And wisdom of the heart.

While sons of {{c|Chordatus}} learned
To swim as hearts burned,
The sons of {{c|Ambulus}} found
Their way was to be bound

As one with nature's way,
{{c|Fishing}} night and day.
They started much the same
As {{c|Chordatus}}' noble name.

But {{c|Hemichus}}, {{c|Ambulus}}' son,
Built his proboscis one
{{c|Day}} long to serve his need.
Half-cord would be his creed.

His cord was only half,
His brain on nature's behalf
Was also halfway made—
Thus {{c|Hemichordates}} stayed.

{{c|Hemichus}} bore two sons:
{{c|Acorn}} when day begun
And {{c|Oak}}, his brother strong,
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Acorn}} lived as worm
Through ocean's every term.
But {{c|Oak}} lived as a tree
{{c|Rooted}} eternally.

{{c|Oak}} bore two sons in time:
{{c|Biscarpon}}, strong and prime,
And {{c|Pterobronk}} his twin,
With different discipline.

{{c|Pterobronk}} became the sire
Of forms that would aspire
To heights in ocean blue:
{{c|Graptolites}} he grew,

And {{c|Pterobranches}} too,
{{c|Colonial}} and true.
Like trees beneath the sea
They lived quite happily.

{{c|Biscarpon}} built with care
A skeleton to wear
Of limestone white and bright
To armor him for fight.

{{c|Biscarpon}} bore two more:
{{c|Ctenocyston}} to explore
The seafloor dark and deep,
And {{c|Cincton}}, who would keep

His gill slits pumping well
Through his armored shell.
{{c|Water}} flowed through his frame
To catch fish in his name.

While {{c|Ctenocyston}} crawled
Where ocean's floor enthralled,
{{c|Cincton}} pumped and fished
For everything he wished.

{{c|Protected}} by his mail
His fishing would not fail.
Through gill slits water flowed
Where tiny fishes showed.

{{c|Cincton}} begat {{c|Soluton}},
A strange and bold one.
One arm he extended out
With tubes that had no doubt

{{c|Inflatable}} and long
To make his fishing strong.
His left side took control
While right side paid the toll.

His right side shriveled small
While left ruled over all.
{{c|Asymmetry}} was born
That bright and fateful morn.

{{c|Soluton}} begat
{{c|Helicoplacus}}, begat
With arms that multiplied
By three on every side.

No bilateral form
Could weather this storm
Of change that swept his line—
{{c|Triradial}} design

He took upon his frame,
A form without a name
That none had seen before
In all primeval lore.

{{c|Helicoplacus}} took the shape
That let his line escape
The ancient symmetry
For new geometry.

{{c|Helicoplacus}} wed
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Adria}}-{{c|Esther}}, led
By love both true and strong
To sing their mating song.

{{c|Together}} they built low
A city's five-fold glow
Upon the rocks below
Where ocean currents flow.

{{c|Pentus}} was their son
When their work was done.
Five-sided was his way,
His form from that day.

The sons of {{c|Pentus}} grew
Both numerous and true.
Great numbers they became
With pentamerous fame.

{{c|Pentus}} begat {{c|Stromatos}},
Who built like great kratos
His strength in five-fold form
Through every ocean storm.

{{c|Stromatos}} begat {{c|Lepidos}},
Who like {{c|Soluton}} chose
To extend his arms once more
Along the ocean floor.

{{c|Ambulacra}} arms he made
In water's bright parade.
These arms would pump and flow
With life from head to toe.

{{c|Lepidos}} begat {{c|Felbabka}},
Who built his strange cabka
Of plates arranged with care
In patterns everywhere.

{{c|Felbabka}} begat {{c|Echidna}},
The stalked one, quite a
{{c|Sight}} with spiny skin
That glowed from deep within.

{{c|Echidna}} was the mother
Of children like no other:
The great {{c|Echinoderms}}
Who live through all terms.

Her daughters were sea lilies
That bloomed like water lilies
And dominated seas
With graceful artistry.

{{c|Invulnerable}} to attack
Their cities bore no lack
Of beauty or of might—
A wondrous, flowery sight.

{{c|Floating}} cities they built
Without any guilt
Upon the ocean floor
Like gardens evermore.

Their great cities were
The greatest ever there
In all the ancient time
When ocean was in prime.

{{c|Today}} we see only
{{c|Ruins}} sad and lonely
Of their once mighty home
Beneath the ocean foam.

But in times past they ruled
As none before had schooled
The art of living well
In ocean's deepest dell.

From half-cord {{c|Hemichus}}
To great {{c|Echidna}} thus
The line of {{c|Ambulus}}
Grew glorious.

The hemichordates showed
How nature's garden flowed
From simple worm-like start
To complex living art.

The graptolites and more
{{c|Pterobranches}} explore
{{c|Colonial}} living true
In waters deep and blue.

The early echinoderms
Found through all their terms
That symmetry could change
Through evolution's range.

From bilateral design
To triradial line
To five-fold form complete—
No other has this feat.

The son of {{c|Ambulus}}
Found glory glorious
Not through swimming fast
But through forms that last.

Their calcium carbonate
Made them fortunate
With armor strong and true
That would see them through

The trials of the sea
Through all eternity.
Their spiny skin would show
How beauty's gardens grow.

In every starfish arm
That moves without alarm,
In every sea urchin's spine
That shows pentamerous design,

In every sea lily's grace
That held the ancient place
Of ruler of the deep
Where ocean's secrets keep,

Remember {{c|Ambulus}}' line
And how their design
Became the five-fold way
That lasts until today.

The sons of {{c|Ambulus}}
Were not so glorious
In swimming strength and speed
As {{c|Chordatus}}' noble creed.

But in their patient art
Of living part by part
With nature's gentle way
They found their destined day.

Their fishing was their gift,
Through ocean's every drift
They learned to be at one
From dusk until the sun.

And so from humble start
They mastered nature's art
Of living in the sea
In perfect harmony.

From {{c|Hemichus}} the half
To {{c|Echidna}}'s behalf
Of all echinoderm kind,
The line of thoughtful mind

Found its way to shine
In pentamerous design.
Five-fold symmetry
Through all eternity.

The ancient cities fell
But still their stories tell
Of how the patient way
Can win the final day.

In gardens of the sea
They lived most gracefully.
Their floating cities bright
Were truly wondrous sight.

Though now in ruins lie
Their glory will not die.
The five-fold legacy
{{c|Lives}} through eternity.
