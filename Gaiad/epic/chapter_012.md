Upon icy {{c|Pluto}}’s cold distant shore,
Two figures stood beneath the endless night.
{{c|Nolah}}, bold and steadfast unto her core,
And {{c|Nemla}}, wise, her heart a beacon bright.

{{c|Together}}, they beheld the frozen land,
A world so far removed from warmth or grace.
Yet in their hearts, the yarn that fate had spanned,
{{c|Connected}} them to {{c|Aster}}'s loving face.

With voices raised to {{c|Aster}} and the stars,
They made a vow to carry on her flame.
"To {{c|Andromeda}}'s light, we'll sail afar,
And keep the yarn intact, without disdain."

{{c|Nemla}} spoke: "To {{c|Andromeda}}, I swear,
Through endless night, our journey will survive.
In every star and dream, our fate is there,
The cosmic yarn that keeps all hope alive."

{{c|Nolah}} spoke: "In {{c|Aster}}'s name, I shall swear,
To guide our line and keep the thread alive.
Through every trial, burden we must bear,
The bond of life and love will yet survive.”

"My lineage traces far, from ancient stars,
Through time and space, the journey's line is clear.
From starlight's first embrace to battle scars,
These ancestors of mine, I hold them dear.

From {{c|Hesper}}'s land came forth mighty {{c|Bios}},
His son, the strong and wise leader, {{c|Kenan}}.
And next, shining high, great and wise {{c|Aenos}},
Then came the builder bold {{c|Malathan}}.

On {{c|Phaestia}}, my ancestors did lead,
Their line continued strong through trials of old.
In every breath, I feel their strength and creed,
Their names still bright, their stories brave and bold.

From {{c|Phaestia}} came the strong wise {{c|Jared}},
Then passed to one with might, named {{c|Maharoch}}.
The ocean's voice was ruled by bold {{c|Enid}},
And from the deep seas rose great {{c|Pahadok}}.

Upon {{c|Serenitide}}, they carved their way,
A path of stars and cosmic truths so grand.
Through many trials, they lived to see the day,
With courage strong, they forged upon this land.

From {{c|Serenitide}} came strong brave {{c|Pelod}},
His wisdom followed by the fierce {{c|Aroch}}.
Then rose another great leader {{c|Nerod}}
The final guide of strength was wise {{c|Larthok}}.

On {{c|Kolob}}'s shores, my forebears stood so tall,
Their courage fierce, as mountains reached the sky.
Through every test, they answered {{c|Aster}}'s call,
And in their steps, I now stand proud and high.

From {{c|Kolob}} came the mighty one, {{c|Idris}},
Then followed by late great {{c|Methuselah}}.
{{c|Next}} came the bold, who led with strength, {{c|Lammes}},
And now the one who carries on, {{c|Nolah}}."

{{c|Nemla}} stood upon the high mountain’s crest,
Before the gathered crowd, with pride he spoke.
His voice a call to honor those he blessed,
The line of {{c|Viros}}, forged through flame and smoke.

"My heritage runs deep from ancient might,
Through {{c|Viros}}' blood, our line was fierce and strong.
They carved the way, enduring every fight,
I walk the path they forged so long, so long."

From {{c|Tezca}} came the feared mighty {{c|Viros}},
His son, a cunning soul, was brave {{c|Caynen}}.
And next, a clever leader, sharp, {{c|Hanos}},
Then stood the wise and fearless {{c|Mehuthen}}.

"On {{c|Phaestia}}'s shores, my great line did tread,
Their strength unmatched as skies and seas did roar.
Their names I honor, though the years have fled,
I honor their heritage evermore."

{{c|Born}} there was strong and keen hero {{c|Irad}}
The next to follow, brave, was {{c|Malathok}}.
Then came the bold and wise, the one called {{c|Hanad}},
His wisdom echoed still in {{c|Peladok}}.

"On {{c|Serenitide}}, they forged their own way,
Through every storm, their spirits never fell.
Their shining star endures through history,
I keep their memory, in stories we tell."

From {{c|Serenitide}} came the strong {{c|Sarnod}},
His son, the skies inspired, was {{c|Alok}}.
Through trials faced, the line passed to {{c|Illod}},
And lastly rose steadfast chieftain {{c|Umroch}}.

"On {{c|Kolob}}'s fertile lands, my line did grow,
They stood as pillars strong, with hearts of flame.
Through every trial, they faced ebb and flow,
Their strength lives on, and I still bear their name."

From {{c|Kolob}} came first {{c|Valorous}} {{c|Oblas}},
Then came great wisdom in {{c|Makusholah}}.
His strength endured through battles, fierce {{c|Romas}}
{{c|Till}} now the line continues with {{c|Nemla}}.

From distant stars, {{c|Aster}}'s voice filled the sky,
"{{c|Here}} in this system, your roots will grow deep.
Through trials and storms, your people will not die,
The light you carry shall forever keep."

With steady voice, {{c|Nolah}} gave her reply,
"We’ll build and guard the flame that guides our way.
Through every darkened night, we’ll rise and try,
Our strength will hold, as we fulfill your say."

{{c|Nemla}} stood tall, her gaze fixed on the stars,
"Across these worlds, your love will guide us through.
Through every trial, no matter how far,
We swear to keep your cosmic vow in view."
