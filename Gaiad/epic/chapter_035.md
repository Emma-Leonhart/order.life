As sons of {{c|Cambrius}} grew in might
Across the world both day and night,
All sons of {{c|Bios}} felt the change
{{c|Throughout}} their ancient range.

The sons of {{c|Cubos}} and {{c|Scyphos}} rose
To challenge all their foes.
Their guerrilla war began
That day when time began.

In ambush still they wait today
To hunt their living prey.
Their ancient raid shall never cease
Until they find their peace.

Among great {{c|Demos}}' sponge-born line
Came {{c|Cyath}}, builder fine.
Great cities he built 'cross the seas—
The reefs beneath the breeze.

These coral cities rise on high
Beneath the ocean sky.
Through countless rulers they endure
With structures strong and pure.

The {{c|Archaeocyathid}} race
Built reefs in every place.
Their legacy lives on today
In reefs where fishes play.

Among the sons of {{c|Demos}} came
The hunters fierce of name:
Great {{c|Chondrocles}}' hunting band
{{c|Spread}} wide across the land.

{{c|Carnivorous}} sponges they became,
With predatory fame.
They trap the sons of {{c|Cambrius}}
With methods dangerous.

Their hooks reach out with deadly art
To pierce the victim's heart.
Their shieldmaidens come for the kill
To satisfy their will.

Among {{c|Spiralius}}' noble line
The sons of {{c|Brachios}} shine.
In new reefs they made their home
Where prosperous they'd roam.

As fishermen they found their way
To fortune every day.
The reefs became their fishing ground
Where plenty could be found.

And so began {{c|Tommotian}} days
Of glory and of praise.
A new era had begun
Beneath the shining sun.

{{c|Here}} now we tell the tale
Of {{c|Lobopus}} without fail.
His vision he imposed with might
On all the world's delight.

Great {{c|Lobopus}} saw his will was weak,
His citizens made meek.
A heart like {{c|Dutrus}} he built true
To nourish all he knew.

From {{c|Lobopus}} came forth
{{c|Onychodictyon}} of worth.
This son would bear two more:
{{c|Tactopus}} to explore
And {{c|Xenu}}, dark and fell,
With stories he would tell.

{{c|Tactopus}} bore twin sons of might:
{{c|Ferreus}} burning bright
And {{c|Ferox}}, strong and bold,
With stories to be told.

But {{c|Xenu}} sought to rule the stars
And heal all psychic scars.
{{c|Emperor}} of galaxy wide
He claimed with foolish pride.

Into our minds he tried to write
{{c|Stories}} of weakness' sight.
But {{c|Gracilis}}, his noble son,
Put end to what he'd done.

And so three houses came to birth:
{{c|Velvetclaw}} upon the earth,
{{c|Ironfoot}} with strength so true,
And {{c|Waterbear}}'s line too.

{{c|Here}} now {{c|Velvetclaw}}'s tale we tell
Of how they rose so well.
From {{c|Gracilis}} came four sons strong:
{{c|Paucipodes}} all along,
{{c|Microdictyon}} brave and true,
{{c|Xenianus}} through and through,
And {{c|Therion}} {{c|Velvetclaw}}
Who followed nature's law.

{{c|Xenianus}} bore twin maids:
{{c|Xenusia}} in the glades
And {{c|Diania}} the {{c|Cactus}} bright
With spines to win the fight.

{{c|Therion}} {{c|Velvetclaw}} begot
{{c|Cardios}}, who fought
And {{c|Hallucigena}} strange
{{c|Throughout}} his living range.

From {{c|Hallucigena}} came
Four children of great fame:
{{c|Sparsa}} quick and light,
{{c|Fortis}} strong in fight,
{{c|Hongmen}} wise and old,
And {{c|Annika}}, brave and bold.

{{c|Hongmen}} bore two sons so grand:
{{c|Luolishania}} in the land
And {{c|Collins}} {{c|Monster}}, fierce and wild,
{{c|Nature}}'s problem child.

But {{c|Annika}} chose a different way,
She cast her armor away.
For agility she traded
Her protection heavy-shaded.

She became the ancestor true
Of velvet worms so blue.
A caring matriarch is she
Who guides them lovingly.

In {{c|Ursus}}' line things went
Down a different bent.
{{c|Ferox}} wanted to survive
{{c|Whatever}} came alive.

He downsized small and tough,
{{c|Invulnerable}} stuff.
From him came {{c|Ursus}} strong,
Who lived both short and long.

{{c|Ursus}} became the sire
Of water bears' entire
{{c|Line}} who first conquered land
With their small, mighty band.

{{c|Unable}} yet to breathe
On land's protecting sheath,
As {{c|Tuns}} they go dormant true
Until the danger's through.

In {{c|Ironfoot}}'s great line
{{c|Greatness}} would shine.
{{c|Ferreus}} {{c|Ironfoot}} bore
Two sons to explore:

{{c|Gille}} built gills with care
Above his legs so fair.
His son {{c|Kerygmachelon}}
{{c|Swam}} with gills upon.

{{c|Kerygmachelon}} the great
Had a noble fate.
He bore son {{c|Pambdelurion}},
{{c|Mighty}} champion.

{{c|Pambdelurion}} bore three
{{c|Children}} of destiny:
{{c|Arthur}} strong and true,
{{c|Anomalos}} who grew
To rule with iron hand,
And fair throughout the land,
{{c|Opabinia}} the bright,
{{c|Beautiful}} to sight.

{{c|Arthur}} built armor strong
To last his whole life long.
His flying gills he hardened tight
And fused them for the fight.

His legs could branch in two:
The gill as exopod grew,
The leg as endopod stayed—
Thus arthropods were made.

The sons of {{c|Anomalos}} ruled
As none before had schooled.
The world entire was theirs
Through all their proud affairs.

For generations ten they reigned
While others were constrained.
From realm of {{c|Ghedos}} dark
He watched his royal mark.

But on his deathbed bed
These words of doom were said:
"{{c|Thy}} pomp brought down to grave,
No power left to save.

How art thou fallen down,
O {{c|Anomalos}} from thy crown!
From heaven thou art cast,
{{c|Thy}} glory could not last."

Yet single death could not end
The suffering they send.
His sons would rule with might
Through day and through the night.

But fair {{c|Opabinia}}'s daughters all
{{c|Answered}} beauty's call.
{{c|Humble}} lives they led
With grace and gentle tread.

And {{c|Arthur}} {{c|Ironfoot}}'s line
Would grow beyond design.
Through hardship they endured
With blood and sweat assured.

The {{c|Arthropods}} they became
With million-species fame.
{{c|Today}} they rule the earth
Since their ancient birth.

From {{c|Lobopus}} came the tide
That spread both far and wide.
Three houses born that day
Would rule in their own way.

{{c|Velvetclaw}} with agile grace,
{{c|Waterbear}}'s enduring race,
{{c|Ironfoot}} with strength so true—
All from one ancestor grew.

The {{c|Tommotian}} age began
With more than mortal plan.
The reefs rose from the sea
For all eternity.

In every coral home
Where fishes freely roam,
Remember {{c|Cyath}}'s art
That gave the reefs their start.

In every velvet worm
That makes the earth worm squirm,
{{c|Annika}}'s caring way
{{c|Lives}} on another day.

In every water bear
That conquers everywhere,
{{c|Ursus}}' strength endures
Through all that time assures.

In every arthropod
That walks upon the sod,
{{c|Arthur}}'s innovation
{{c|Shaped}} our creation.

The sons of {{c|Cambrius}} changed
How all life was arranged.
Their multiplication
Changed all of creation.

But from these changes came
{{c|Lines}} of lasting fame:
The builders of the reef,
The hunters beyond belief.

The three great houses rose
To challenge all their foes.
Through innovation true
They made the world anew.
