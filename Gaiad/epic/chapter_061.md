# Chapter 61: The {{c|Land}} {{c|Bridge}}

{{c|Rhipidistius}} the great survived the fall
When devastation swept the world away,
A hero of his time who heard the call
To show the faithful path through that dark day.

Through trials dark and deep he learned to keep
His vigil bright and never lost his hope
Beyond the bounds of earth's eternal sleep
Into the light of evolution's scope.

{{c|Rhipidistius}} bore two sons of might,
Both noble, tried and true through every test:
{{c|Dipnos}} and {{c|Tetram}}, warriors of light
Who lived their lives according to what's best.

{{c|Dipnos}} became the father of those who
Would breathe the air when waters would recede:
The lungfish with their breathing powers new
Could live dual lives to meet their every need.

When drought would steal away the waters clear
Where they had played in youth's eternal spring,
The lungfish could survive from year to year
And stay alive through everything.

By breathing air so free from sky above
{{c|Throughout}} eternity they would survive
Until the rains returned with gentle love
And waters they had yearned for came alive

To fill their homes once more from peak to shore
With life-sustaining flood that stirred their blood,
The gift of dual breath would evermore
{{c|Protect}} them through both drought and mighty flood.

{{c|Tetram}} transformed his gut to linear form,
A change that let him eat giant fish with ease,
This innovation helped him weather storm
And find his food in rivers, lakes, and seas.

All fish have nostrils four by nature's law:
Two let the water pour inside for breath,
Two let the water flow without a flaw
{{c|Back}} out through gills that conquer watery death.

{{c|Tetram}} was no exception to this rule,
His nostrils came in four like all before,
But he became evolution's greatest tool
By breathing differently than ancestral lore.

{{c|Tetram}} breathed not through nostrils tried and true,
But through his ears instead to fill his frame
With air's sweet power that would help him view
{{c|Possibilities}} beyond his earthly name.

He breathed through otic notches crystal clear
That brought the air into his living form
And gave him power to transcend all fear
And rise above each evolutionary storm.

But breathing through his ears brought bitter tears
For it made hearing difficult and hard,
His auditory guard throughout the years
Was weakened by this choice that left him scarred.

Yet {{c|Tetram}} bore a son when work was done:
{{c|Kenicthus}}, strong and true through every trial,
Who'd see the journey through till victory won
And walk the path of landward exile.

{{c|Kenicthus}} bore two sons of noble birth:
{{c|Tetracan}} and {{c|Rhizodon}}, both brave and strong,
Each destined to inherit half the earth
And sing evolution's ancient song.

{{c|Tetracan}} bore two faithful sons again:
{{c|Tetramegas}} great and {{c|Canowin}}'s line,
Both destined to become the best of men
And make their father's legacy divine.

{{c|Tetramegas}} bore two sons of might:
{{c|Eotetras}} the explorer of the deep
And {{c|Megalicthus}} who saw the light
Of promises that faithful hearts can keep.

{{c|Eotetras}} begat in days of old
Both {{c|Tintetra}} of sight and {{c|Tristichos}},
Whose names would rise to fame in stories told
Of how from fish the land-dweller arose.

{{c|Tintetra}} bore two sons beyond compare:
{{c|Platelpis}} and {{c|Tiniraus}}, each following
{{c|Different}} laws but sharing the same prayer
For growth through each new dawn that life is bringing.

{{c|Platelpis}} bore two sons of different ways:
{{c|Elpis}} the wanderer, tried and true,
And {{c|Platycephalus}} through all his days
Who lived by strength in everything he'd do.

{{c|Platycephalus}} had made a skull so strong
His bite could break through anything at all,
No obstacle could challenge him for long
When power was his answer to life's call.

But {{c|Elpis}} wandered far beneath the stars
Across the swamps so wide with wonder bright,
He explored the world from near to distant fars
And filled his days with beauty and delight.

Through marshes dark and deep where secrets dwell
He kept his vigil through the passing years,
{{c|Despite}} all joys and fears he knew full well
That exploration conquers all our fears.

{{c|Elpis}} begat a son when wandering done:
{{c|Pandericthus}} the brave who'd rise above
The wave of ordinary life to stun
The world with his pursuit of perfect love.

{{c|Pandericthus}} searched long throughout the land
For love's eternal call that echoes clear
Across the world where hearts can understand
The song that only faithful lovers hear.

And he found love so true in {{c|Stega}} fair,
A maiden bright who filled his world with light,
He married her with joy beyond compare
And made their union shine both day and night.

{{c|Together}} they would raise with tender care
A son whom they would name {{c|Tictalicus}},
A name that would be known everywhere
As greater than a throne most glorious.

{{c|Tictalicus}} was destined for the fate
Of landwalker supreme who'd realize
The dream of all who came from oceanic state
To find their freedom underneath the skies.

{{c|Tictalicus}} begat {{c|Elgin}} the wise
Who sat upon the throne of those who chose
To rise beyond the bonds that compromise
The soul and find the peace that freedom knows.

{{c|Elgin}} begat a son of noble birth:
{{c|Ventas}}, who'd carry forth the lineage pure
Of those who'd found their home upon the earth
And made their father's legacy endure.

{{c|Ventas}} begat {{c|Acanthos}}, strong and true,
A leader who would guide his people well
Through every trial that they would go through
And every challenge time would ever tell.

{{c|Acanthos}} bore {{c|Icthyos}} of the light,
A son who'd change the way that life was lived
By making breathing work exactly right
And healing wounds that evolution gived.

{{c|Icthyos}} made the choice to change his ways:
He stopped breathing through ears that caused him pain
And started breathing through his nose through days
And nights until he could hear clearly again.

He connected nostrils to his mouth with care
So air could flow in cleaner, purer streams
And he could smell each scent upon the air
And hear each sound in all his vivid dreams.

{{c|Now}} he could hear with crystal clarity
Each whisper of the wind through forest green
And smell with perfect sensory ability
The sweetest fragrances he'd ever seen.

{{c|Icthyos}} bore a son when youth was past:
The {{c|Watcher}} who would build no gills at all,
{{c|Despite}} the water's call that held him fast
He chose to heed the land's eternal call.

For {{c|Watcher}} needed none—when youth was done
He lived upon the land both green and wide,
Built by the faithful work of everyone
Who'd made the journey from the ocean's side.

As child he'd play in water every day
But when he came of age he turned the page
In evolution's book and chose the way
Of those who'd left the sea's ancestral cage.

He lived on land so green and breathed air free
{{c|Throughout}} his days beneath the open sky,
And there he raised his sons in harmony
With all the earth beneath and heaven high.

{{c|Watcher}} bore two sons of different hearts:
{{c|Crassigar}} and {{c|Tetrus}}, each would choose
A different path as life's great story starts
And some will win while others have to lose.

{{c|Crassigar}} made the choice to hear the call
Of ocean's voice and went back to the sea,
A path that would be taken by them all
Who yearned for water's ancient harmony.

This choice would be repeated many times
By those who'd hear the water's cheerful song
That echoed through the ages and the rhymes
Of those who felt they didn't quite belong

Upon the land where air was thin and dry
But missed the gentle rocking of the waves
Beneath the vast expanse of ocean sky
In underwater halls and coral caves.

But {{c|Tetrus}} chose a different destiny:
To be the father of the nations new
Who'd stay upon the land eternally
With legs or arms or whatever would do

To help them crawl or walk upon the ground
That made their lives complete in every way,
Their hearts upon the solid earth were bound
To build their cities bright from day to day.

He became the great father of all those
Who'd rather live in air forever free
{{c|Than}} go back to the sea where their birth arose
But now they sang a different melody.

From {{c|Rhipidistius}}' survival through the night
To evolution's arrival at the door
Of land both green and filled with morning light,
The vertebrates discovered something more

{{c|Than}} they had ever dreamed was possible
In their ancestral home beneath the waves:
The freedom that would make responsible
Each soul that from the sea's embrace it saves.

From lungfish breathing air when waters fail
To {{c|Watcher}} living wholly on the land,
The story shows how life will never pale
When guided by evolution's mighty hand.

The landwalkers prepared the way for all
Who dared to leave behind the watery past
And build upon the land when they heard the call
Of freedom that would make the good things last.

From {{c|Tetram}}'s breathing through his otic ear
To {{c|Icthyos}} connecting mouth and nose,
Each innovation helped them persevere
And find the path that to perfection goes.

From {{c|Pandericthus}} searching for true love
To {{c|Stega}}'s marriage blessed by heaven's grace,
The vertebrates remind us to rise above
Our limitations and find our place

In partnership so true it helps us through
The trials of the way from night to day
Where all who dare to dream will find what's new
And walk in freedom's bright eternal way.

The legacy lives on in every breath
We take and every choice we make today
To grow beyond the bonds of living death
And heed the call of light's eternal ray.

From {{c|Rhipidistius}} great to {{c|Tetrus}}' fate
Of building nations new with vision clear,
The vertebrates have shown that those who wait
Upon the {{c|Lord}} will find His presence near.

From simple start below the ocean's foam
To all we'll ever know of freedom's song,
They've shown us how to find our perfect home
Where souls can dwell in peace their whole life long.

The bridge from sea to land is now complete,
The path is open for all those who dare
To leave behind the past and find the sweet
{{c|Release}} of breathing in the open air.
