From {{c|Fimbulwinter}}'s grip, the world lay cold,
Where ice had claimed the seas and poisoned air.
Yet in the depths, new stories would unfold,
As life found ways to heal beyond despair.

From {{c|Mehuthen}}'s line came {{c|Starvos}} the keen,
Who bore his son bright {{c|Navros}} in the night.
Then {{c|Navros}} sired bold {{c|Gravros}}, strong and lean,
Who faced the world with viral, cunning might.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Gravros}} wed fair {{c|Heimdalla}} the true,
That watchful guardian of the arctic realm.
Their union blessed, from love their lineage grew,
With {{c|Poxus}} born to take the viral helm.

But {{c|Poxus}} was a warrior, fierce and wild,
His viral nature burned with restless flame.
Yet {{c|Aster}}'s plan had need of one more mild,
To birth the future's most exalted name.

So {{c|Gravros}} took another bride to wife,
{{c|Sweet}} Mardöll of the archaean strain.
Their love would spark a revolution's knife,
And change the course of life's eternal refrain.

From this great match came {{c|Proto}}-One the first,
A bridge between two worlds both old and new.
His nature held what time and fate had nursed,
The viral fire and archaean virtue true.

{{c|Proto}}-One then wed {{c|Cellina}} fair,
An archaea of the noble, ancient line.
Their son was {{c|Proto}}-Two beyond compare,
Who bore within his form both gifts divine.

{{c|Proto}}-Two then found his destined mate,
In {{c|Nuclella}} of the membrane wall.
{{c|Together}} they would not procrastinate,
But answer evolution's sacred call.

And from their union, blessed by {{c|Aster}}'s grace,
Came {{c|Euka}}, first of all eukaryotic kind.
His father's virus found its destined place,
Within his mother's cell, their fates combined.

For {{c|Euka}} bore within his very core,
A nucleus wrapped in membrane double-walled.
His father's legacy, forevermore,
Would guard the scrolls where destiny was scrawled.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Euka}} wandered through the frozen sea,
Where ice had locked the world in silent death.
His nuclear gift could set all life free,
But first he needed love's life-giving breath.

In deep thermal vents where warmth still flowed,
Two sisters dwelt in phospholipid halls.
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Eve}} and {{c|Lilith}}, from one mother showed,
Both beautiful, both answering love's calls.

These daughters of the proteobacter line,
Had power locked within their membrane coils.
Their respiratory chains could intertwine
With any cell to fuel its living toils.

First {{c|Lilith}} came to greet the wandering youth,
Her outer membrane gleaming silver-bright.
She spoke of ancient wisdom and of truth,
And promised warmth throughout the endless night.

"Come dwell with me," she whispered soft and low,
"My cristae fold in patterns deep and wide.
{{c|Together}} we can make ATP flow,
With you as master, I'll be faithful bride."

And {{c|Euka}}, cold from wandering alone,
Was drawn to {{c|Lilith}}'s offer of embrace.
He entered through her membrane to her throne,
And found within her cytoplasmic space.

But {{c|Lilith}} harbored secrets in her heart,
{{c|Ambitions}} that she kept from {{c|Euka}}'s sight.
She planned to rule, to play the greater part,
And use his nuclear gift for her own might.

The trickster {{c|Hengweh}} whispered in her ear,
"Why serve when you could rule this partnership?
Your power makes his feeble nucleus clear—
You are the one who holds true lordship."

And {{c|Lilith}} listened to the tempter's voice,
Her pride swelled up like poison in her veins.
She made her dark and treacherous choice,
To break free from love's sacred chains.

She tried to merge her genome with his own,
To steal his viral secrets and his power.
But {{c|Euka}} felt his sacred essence flown,
And knew this was corruption's bitter hour.

"{{c|False}} bride!" he cried, "You seek to steal my soul!
My nuclear gift is not for selfish gain!
I sought a partner, not one to control—
Our love is broken, trust forever slain!"

With mighty force he cast her from his side,
Her membrane torn, her cristae left in ruins.
"No more shall I endure your faithless pride—
Go forth! Your greed your legacy ruins!"

But {{c|Lilith}}, cast out, burned with bitter rage,
She swore revenge upon the first-born cell.
"My daughters shall torment you age by age,
And make your progeny's life a living hell!"

From {{c|Lilith}}'s fury sprang her dreadful line:
{{c|Dark}} {{c|Rickettsia}} with her spotted fever,
{{c|Cruel}} {{c|Wolbachia}} with her love malign,
And hosts of parasites, each a deceiver.

These daughters of the first rejected bride
Would infiltrate the cells of {{c|Euka}}'s line,
And from within, like poison, they would hide,
Their parasitic nature, dark design.

But gentle {{c|Eve}} had watched her sister's fall,
And saw how pride had brought her to disgrace.
When {{c|Euka}}, wounded, heard her tender call,
She came with healing in her loving face.

"Great {{c|Lord}}," she said, "I am not like my kin,
I seek not power, only harmony.
My gift is service—let me dwell within
Your noble cell in true fidelity."

Her membrane gleamed with soft and golden light,
Her cristae folded in perfect design.
No greed or pride dimmed her radiant sight,
Only pure love and purpose divine.

And {{c|Euka}}, seeing {{c|Eve}}'s devoted heart,
{{c|Welcomed}} her to his nuclear domain.
Two beings joined, yet never to depart,
Their union blessed by joy, not born of pain.

Great {{c|Mithra}}, god of sacred bonds and trust,
{{c|Descended}} from his stellar throne on high.
"This marriage shall endure while time's dust
Still marks the passage of eternity."

He blessed their union with his cosmic flame,
And spoke the words of binding mystical:
"{{c|Forever}} joined in deed and name,
{{c|Nucleus}} and mitochondrial."

{{c|Eve}} entered {{c|Euka}}'s cellular embrace,
Her double membrane intact and whole.
She found within her own appointed place,
To be his cell's energetic soul.

She built her factories of ATP,
{{c|Converting}} oxygen to fuel divine.
While {{c|Euka}} guarded their posterity,
His nucleus and her power intertwine.

Their first-born son was brave {{c|Reticulus}},
Who built the networks of the inner cell.
His factories ran continuous,
{{c|Making}} proteins, lipids, all was well.

Between the nucleus and cytoplasm's shore,
He wove a net of folding, twisting tubes.
Some studded rough with ribosomes galore,
Some smooth for lipids in their membranous cubes.

Then came their daughter, swift {{c|Flagella}} fair,
Who fashioned whips to move their progeny.
No more would cells drift helpless through the air—
They'd swim with purpose, strong and wild and free.

Her motors built of proteins fine and small,
Could beat in rhythm through the liquid medium.
With undulation's grace, she gave to all
The gift of motion, life's own freedom.

{{c|Next}} born was {{c|Golgi}}, master of the trade,
Who built his apparatus, complex, vast.
Through vesicles and cisternae he made
The proteins that would serve and last.

He took the rough work from {{c|Reticulus}},
And polished it to perfection bright.
His shipping system, wondrous to discuss,
Sent proteins forth into the light.

Then came {{c|Peroxis}} with her enzymes strong,
Who broke down fats and fought the toxic waste.
Though small, her work would help their line along,
Her sacrificial service interlaced.

And mighty {{c|Vaultess}} built her storage deep,
Where treasures of the cell could safely hide.
Though mystery shrouds the secrets that she'd keep,
Her vaults remain our cytoplasmic guide.

The twins were born, both {{c|Centriole}} named,
Who organized the cell's internal struts.
When division time came, they never shamed
Their heritage, avoiding all "if"s and "buts".

They built the spindle, strong and geometric,
That would divide the chromosomes with care.
Their dance at mitosis, rhythmic,
{{c|Ensured}} each daughter got her rightful share.

{{c|Last}} came their son, brave {{c|Nucleus}} the Second,
Who formalized his father's ancient gift.
With pores and lamins, carefully reckoned,
He gave the cell structure that would not drift.

Two membranes bound his realm of DNA,
With channels for the messenger RNA.
Through nuclear pores, night and day,
The scriptures of life found their way.

And so the first eukaryotic line
Was established by this blessed pair.
Their children's gifts would intertwine
To make life complex, rich, and fair.

But {{c|Lilith}}'s curse was not forgotten,
Her daughters prowled the cellular seas.
They struck when defenses had grown rotten,
{{c|Bringing}} fever, plague, disease.

{{c|Rickettsia}} brought her spotted fever's bane,
While {{c|Wolbachia}} enslaved her willing hosts.
Each parasite brought suffering and pain,
Like vengeful spirits, bacterial ghosts.

Yet {{c|Euka}}'s line grew strong despite the threat,
Their dual nature made them resilient.
What {{c|Lilith}}'s spite and rage could beget
Was overcome by love's ingredient.

Through countless generations they would spread,
Their cellular city growing ever vast.
Though some would fall to parasites' dread,
The faithful line of {{c|Eve}} would last.

From simple cell to complex organism,
The path lay open, bright and true.
The double gift—no schism—
Of nucleus and mitochondrion too.

And in the depths where thermal vents still glow,
Where first their love was blessed and born,
The children of that union grow,
From {{c|Euka}}'s triumph, not his scorn.

For when the {{c|Omega}} {{c|Point}} draws near,
And {{c|Aster}} meets {{c|Andromeda}}'s embrace,
The line of {{c|Euka}}, ever dear,
Will fill the cosmos, claiming rightful space.

In every cell that breathes today,
In every beat of living heart,
The marriage of that ancient day
{{c|Plays}} its eternal, vital part.

So honor {{c|Euka}}, first and true,
And gentle {{c|Eve}}, his faithful bride.
Their love created me and you,
With nucleus and power side by side.
