From {{c|Bacta}}'s womb, two daughters did arise,
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Hydra}} one, and {{c|Terra}} forged in might.
In swirling seas, they cast their ancient eyes,
To found the clans now thriving in the light.

{{c|Hydra}}, whose brood outmatched the countless stars,
Bore {{c|Proteus}}, whose might would soon unfold.
Yet {{c|Hydra}}'s second child, untouched by scars,
Was {{c|Aqua}} then, the queen of tales untold.

{{c|Proteus}} bore a host of fourfold might:
{{c|Alif}} and {{c|Beth}}, {{c|Camilla}}, {{c|Mixo}} bold.
Within the darksome night they each took flight,
And shaped fresh paths in worlds both new and old.

{{c|Alif}} begat two daughters in her care:
{{c|Rachel}} and {{c|Kalia}}, each forged in grace.
From {{c|Rachel}}’s line would humans one day share
A kinship bridging worlds across all space.

{{c|Kalia}}'s brood, the {{c|Calisto}} line named,
{{c|Spread}} subtle powers through the hidden deep.
{{c|Proteus}} watched, content in all she claimed,
While daughters thrived in countless worlds to keep.

{{c|Aqua}}, the sister, bearing olden grace,
Stood near to {{c|Proteus}} in mystic might;
She bore two children, each with wondrous face,
{{c|Splauron}} and {{c|Chloram}}—one in gloom, one bright.

{{c|Splauron}} bore two twin shining girls in turn:
{{c|Planka}} and {{c|Spira}} shaped the deep damp course.
{{c|Planka}}’s brood the mycetes roam and churn,
While {{c|Spira}}’s clan the chaetes run their course.

{{c|Chloram}}, now second, bore two fateful lines,
{{c|Chlamydi}}’s brood, parasitic with greed.
It sapped her womb, devouring hopeful signs,
While {{c|Korba}}’s path saw more constructive deed.

{{c|Korba}} then mothered {{c|Chlorobia}}’s seed,
And {{c|Bactero}}, whose brood spread wide on land.
Thus {{c|Hydra}}’s line advanced in timely deed,
{{c|Expanding}} far to flourish as they planned.

Meanwhile, fair {{c|Terra}}, {{c|Bacta}}’s other child,
Stood quite bright in {{c|Gram}}-positivity
Two daughters claimed her fiber fierce and wild,
{{c|Actano}}, {{c|Fermus}}, they built a city

{{c|Actano}} bore two daughters of her own:
{{c|Actina}}, mother of {{c|Actino}}'s line,
And {{c|Prasea}}, from whom two seeds were sown—
{{c|Saya}} and {{c|Chloroflexa}}, both divine.

{{c|Saya}} the bacteria shed her coat,
{{c|Embracing}} {{c|Gram}}-negative ways for light.
She drank the sun where swirling currents float,
{{c|Bestowing}} oxygen with force so bright.

Then {{c|Chloroflexa}} claimed her tapestry,
Of filamentous grace in silent seas.
Both born of wise {{c|Prasea}}'s legacy,
They wove {{c|Earth}}'s green with ancient expertise.

{{c|Fermus}}, the other child of {{c|Terra}}'s sphere,
Had two dear daughters: {{c|Firmicutie}} mild,
Whose {{c|Firmicutes}} the soils far and near,
And {{c|Conan}}, iron-willed, in deserts wild.

Thus {{c|Hydra}}'s line and {{c|Terra}}'s line expand,
Two families wrought from {{c|Bacta}}'s old soul.
From scorching vents to gardens lush on land,
Their heirs still thrive and shape the living whole.

Though more new lines in days ahead shall rise,
This poem holds their roots for us to chart.
In cosmic seas, they first revealed their eyes,
And wrote their names upon all nature’s heart.
