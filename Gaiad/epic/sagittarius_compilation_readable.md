# Sagittarius (1宮) - Days 1-28

*The Primordial History - From Creation to the First Animals*

---

Once upon a time there was a catgirl
Her name was Aster, and she had a ball,
Of yarn she spun, with skill just like a pearl.
She shaped the universe from void to all.

Her name, a whisper in the cosmic night,
Aster, the Alpha, creatrix of all,
Her love, a beacon spreading pure and bright,
Filled the vast cosmos with milk, a grand sprawl.

But Aster was alone, in her cosmos,
A silent void, where only echoes ring,
Her heart yearned for a friend, a loving close,
To share the wonders that her hands could bring.

So she decided to make another,
From yarn, she formed a catgirl, pure and fair,
A companion to cherish, a lover
Andromeda, with skin dark, flowing hair

Andromeda, Omega, end of all,
A counterpart to Aster, wings unfurled,
Yet torn apart, they drift through space’s thrall,
Unable to unite within their world.

Aster threw yarn to Andromeda's side,
But it broke, forming galaxies anew.
Triangulum and Magellan clouds wide,
From threads that snapped, a cosmic scene we view.

And so, each day, we gaze up to the sky,
At Sagittarius and the Princess
We hope their union, once again, draws nigh,
When Milkdromeda forms from love endless

The Omega point, all will unify,
As Aster and Andromeda break free.
To join at last, in celestial tie,
A final act in cosmic harmony.



---

This tale you hear is not just woven lore,
But truths divine, a map for every soul.
In Aster's yarn and Andromeda's core,
We find the threads that make the cosmos whole.

As you embark, this journey shall reveal,
The path to reunite the love once torn.
Your life, a thread, within this cosmic wheel,
Will help to weave the dawn of their new morn.

Aster, with bow in hand, released a thread,
A string of red that soared through cosmic space,
But in its flight, it faltered, lost ahead,
And failed to reach Andromeda's embrace.

Andromeda, with bow and string of blue,
She aimed her shot across the starry sea,
But like the red, her thread could not break through,
And fell just short, her love still out of reach.

Triangulum and Magellanic clouds,
They gathered bits of green from space’s weave,
And tied the strings, with careful, gentle shrouds,
Uniting red and blue, a bond to weave.

And so, each day, we gaze up to the sky,
At Sagittarius and the Princess
We hope their union, once again, draws nigh,
When Milkdromeda forms from love endless

The threads we see above, they are our own,
Our destinies in red, in green, in blue,
We weave the fabric where their love is shown,
Together in the sky, our fates accrue.

The Omega point, all will unify,
As Aster and Andromeda break free.
To join at last, in celestial tie,
A final act in cosmic harmony.



---

As above, so below, the stars reflect,
The cosmic tales that shape our earthly lives.
Aster's children below, she will protect,
With milk she spun from stars, the world survives.

Her love, a beacon bright, to light the way,
Through all the mysteries that life may hold.
From cosmic depths, her love pours night and day,
A river of bright stars, a feast of old.

Andromeda, her love shines from afar,
Her bond with Aster, strong as brightest light.
For they are bound by Lambda, like a star,
A cosmic force that keeps their love alight.

In their celestial dance, the heavens sway,
The tale of Aster and Andromeda, told.
A love that binds the night and lights the day,
A cosmic love beyond what words can hold.

Aster imagined children, stars so bright,
To mend the string and guide her love to stay.
She knew Andromeda would share this light,
Together they'd unite, love's grand display.

A grand reunion, spanning time and space,
With threads of stars to keep the bond alive.
She stirred her milk to birth this sacred place,
A galaxy where all her dreams would thrive.

Aster stirred her milk, the great Milky way,
With helium and light, her stars are spun.
She swirled the cosmic blend in careful sway,
From curds of light, the stars are gently won.

A pantheon of stars, in heaven’s care,
A host of stars, in heaven’s gentle sway,
Their cosmic stories weave through skies so fair,
Their cosmic tales unfold in bright display.

The eldest star of every kind will stand,
A guiding sister with a steady hand.
They lead their cosmic kin through endless night,
A beacon of their strength and shining light.

Juno, the goddess, Steppenwolves she guides,
Her gas giants hide in their quiet might.
Discovery and distant worlds she rides,
A cosmic guide who wanders through the night.

Brunhilda watches stars that failed to blaze,
Incomplete fusion, dim yet bittersweet.
A guardian of twilight's fading rays,
Her presence marks the stars' unfinished beat.

Ruby, the red dwarf, small but ever bright,
Her steady flame still burns throughout today.
To witness cosmic dusk with peaceful light,
She sees Omega Point as time gives way.

Chrystella shines with vibrant, youthful glow,
Main sequence stars, her hot flashes ignite.
As giants red, their elder forms will grow,
Then fade with age, surrendering their light.

Now as a white dwarf, small and old she rests,
A little lady in the cosmic sea.
Her planetary nebula still reflects,
The brilliance of her once bright majesty.

Celestella commands her giant blaze,
Red supergiants in her name grow vast.
With neutron stars and pulsars in her gaze,
She watches supernovae's fiery blast.

Gigastella shone with a force untamed,
Her sister Celestella, bright and vast.
The stress of cosmic weight left her inflamed,
Her life burned fast, her brilliance could not last.

In her collapse, a supernova flared,
A brilliant burst before she fell from sight.
From that great death, a black hole then prepared,
To pull the stars into eternal night.

The tale of Rhodes and Marigold begins,
A union forged in stars, their love so bright.
The first of lovers bound, their fate still spins,
A cosmic dance that guides us through the night.

Rhodes, son of Ruby, dim with crimson glow,
And Marigold, of Chrystella's bright line,
Were joined in love, the stars watched from below,
The first celestial bond, forever fine.

Their love was strong, unwavering and true,
Though Marigold was bright, a shining flame,
While Rhodes, much smaller, dim in ruby hue,
Yet still their hearts burned with a single name.

As years passed on, Marigold's light grew red,
Her youthful glow now fading into age.
She gave her breath to Rhodes, who soared ahead,
And shone with yellow light, her bright young stage.

As Marigold grew small, her light turned white,
Yet Rhodes stayed close, his glow now burning red.
From novas born, came lithium's bright light,
A starry gift, as love between them spread.

The nova's burst had filled his heart with fear,
So Rhodes withheld his gift for many years.
For twenty-five, the skies stayed calm and clear,
Until again, their love burst forth with cheers.

For countless years, their rhythm stayed the same,
Each nova lighting skies with love’s great might.
Once every age, their gift became a flame,
A cycle known as Nova’s sacred light.

As time went on, they both grew small and white,
Yet side by side, they watched the stars they made.
Their children shining in the nebula’s light,
A legacy of love that would not fade.

And now, we honor them in wedding vows,
With ruby rings for one, and topaz bright.
White opal marks the bond that time allows,
A symbol of their love’s enduring light.

Aster made the milk pregnant with cat seed,
The curds take shape within the swirling storm.
Her essence spreads, a cosmic plan decreed,
In every star, her life begins to form.

As hydrocarbons drift through endless skies,
Her scent, like burnt steak, lingers far and wide.
Aster's presence fills all the stars that rise,
Her love and life, the galaxy's great guide.

Across the galaxy, her force expands,
A testament to love, her cosmic plan.
With planets forming in the starry bands,
She fills the heavens, spreading life to man.

Each star with planets, water deep and wide,
Oceans abound, where life begins to bloom.
A seed of creation on the tides side,
Aster's breath gives life from the cosmic womb.

From microbes small to creatures of the sea,
Her love ensures that life will find its way.
Each world unique, a thriving symphony,
Her touch endures in life's eternal sway.

Andromeda, with pride, looks from afar,
In awe of Aster's gift to life and light.
Their bond, a force that shapes both land and star,
A love eternal, woven through the night.

Their love, the fabric of the universe,
A bond that shapes the stars and worlds below.
The cosmos thrives, their union to rehearse,
A tale of love that evermore will grow.

From ocean depths to stars that brightly shine,
Aster's life force in every corner gleams.
The epic weaves, through space and time divine,
A cosmic love that fills our hopes and dreams.

Upon the shores of Hesper, where waves meet,
Aster's vital force descended from the skies.
Her essence, tholins, seed, a cosmic feat,
The seeds of life in ocean depths arise.

Beneath Tezca's sun, the light warm and bright,
It nourished all the life on Hesper's shore.
Its rays gave strength to creatures in their plight,
A guiding force that helped new life to soar.

Through swirling tides, her power filled the sea,
A gentle glow, life's first soft, pulsing breath.
From self-creation, forms began to be,
Aster's love transcends the void of death.

The seed, her essence, spread across the deep,
Multiplying, and thriving in the dark.
From smallest life to creatures vast, they creep,
Her love and light ignite creation’s spark.

Each wave, a testament to her grand plan,
The birth of life upon this fateful shore.
As microbes crawled, so did the race of man,
Their fragile forms to flourish evermore.

---

Upon the shores of Hesper, life was born,
Yet fragile were the forms that learned to crawl.
Aster looked upon them, she came to warn,
That death she feared might soon consume them all.

In worry for her children's frail design,
She wept a tear and formed a plan so grand.
From phospholipid threads, a new divine,
She wove for them a shield by her own hand.

A suit of armor born from Aster's mind,
A fusion of both life and machine’s grace.
To keep her fragile creatures well-aligned,
These cyborg forms would rise and take their place.

Phospholipid bilayers, soft but strong,
Became their shells, protecting life within.
A new creation, steady to prolong,
The march of life, immune to time’s great sin.

And so, all life became both flesh and steel,
A union of the ancient and the new.
Through varied landscapes, cyborgs learned to feel,
Their strength now boundless as they boldly grew.

Three brothers stood, their destinies held close,
One to nurture life, his name was Bios.
Another thrived through cunning, slick Viros,
The last sought purity, he was Dedos.

The brothers gathered in a hallowed place,
To honor those who brought them to this time.
With solemn hearts, they stood and did retrace,
The lineage that wove their cosmic line.

"From starlight spun came forth Lady Aster,
Her daughter followed bright, Cosmic Benzette.
Through twilight's glow was born Granny Hesper,
Then came her child, great wise Quinamette."

As silence fell, the brothers paused to think,
For in their minds, a question did arise.
"What should we call great Aster?"—on the brink,
Of naming her, they pondered, deep and wise.

"For Benzette is our great-grandmother true,"
Said Bios, thoughtful as the stars above.
"So Hesper is our grandmother, we knew,
And Quinamette, our mother filled with love."

Viros spoke next, his mind as sharp as light,
"Then Aster stands beyond them all, it's clear.
There is no greater grandmother in sight—
Should we not name her 'Greatest,' far and near?"

Dedos agreed, with reverence in his tone,
"There's none beyond our lineage so bright.
Aster is the Greatest we have known,
And so, her title shines in endless light."

And this is why we call her to this day,
Our Greatest Grandmother, wise and true.
Her light still guides us on our cosmic way,
A title passed to us and all of you.

In cyborg age, three brothers took their stand,
Their legacies now stretch across the sky.
Under the sun Tezca, their names command,
A force still felt as ages pass them by.

Bios, Viros, Dedos—each carved his way,
Entwined by fate, yet each would shape his course.
Within the bilayers, their paths did sway,
Their legacies still felt with cosmic force.

Bios, the builder, sought to grow and thrive,
He filled his shell with life, a boundless glow.
Through mitosis, his legacy would strive,
And life would flourish everywhere he'd go.

But Viros saw another way to grow,
A path of cunning, viral bursts he spread.
Replication's force, his very great show,
Consuming life, where others built instead.

While Dedos, firm, rejected cyborg might,
Preferring nature's purity to stand.
Yet scarcity and sun wore down his life,
His fragile form no match for Hesper's land.

The sons of Bios thrived, expanding wide,
Their legacy grew vast, from sea to peak.
While Viros' spawn pursued them far and wide,
A cycle fed on life, both strong and weak.

Yet Dedos' line was met with bitter fate,
Starvation, radiation claimed their end.
But in their fall, they left a creed innate—
A call for purity, no rules to bend.

From Bios and Viros, some took the name,
A path of nature Dedos would bestow.
Anti-vaxxers joined his lineal claim,
United in their ancient quest to grow.

And so, the brothers’ legacies unfold,
Their tale lives on beneath the cosmic sun.
In phospholipid worlds where life took hold,
The story thrives, the cosmic plan's begun.

But fate had other plans beyond their shore,
As Hesper faced a trial from the skies.
A meteor, a force they can't ignore,
Descended fast, to bring the world's demise.

The impact shook the earth, the oceans roared,
The children of the brothers swept away.
Their fragile hopes and legacies all soared,
In shattered fragments, flung to cosmic bay.

Amidst the wreck, the remnants left behind,
Set course for Venti, gas giant great.
A shining moon, Phaestia, they would find,
A refuge for the lost, a twist of fate.

Through starlit space, their journey carried on,
The bonds of fate and fortune held them tight.
Toward a moon, a glowing cosmic dawn,
They ventured forth, prepared for a new fight.

In hearts, they knew a tale would soon arise,
Their journey far from over, hope renewed.
Phaestia's light would greet their tearful eyes,
A home where life could once again be brewed.



---

Upon the moon Phaestia, life did bloom,
It circled Vayu, underneath the sun.
Aster, by Ehēca's light, dispelled the gloom,
Her guiding hand ensured all life begun.

People of Phaestia, blessed by her hand,
Knew many names for Aster in their lore.
Her power felt in sky, in sea, and land,
Her essence woven deep in every core.

By many titles did the stars proclaim
The goddess who had given life its start.
They honored her with reverence and great flame,
For Aster lived within each beating heart.

She ruled the oceans vast with gentle hand,
Empress of cosmic waters, Suiten.
The star that guides the lost through every land,
The Great Empress of the North Star, Myoken.

From supernova’s heart, she forged with might,
Cosmic metals shaping, Konjin-sama.
The breath of life that fills the endless night,
The great creatrix of all worlds, Brahma.

Her light that spreads across the cosmic span,
The goddess of all space, Vairocana.
She holds the deepest void beyond the plan,
The keeper of the dark, Saint Varuna.

In the deep waters, creatures thrived and grew,
From microbes small to beasts of wondrous size.
The seas, a dance of vibrant cosmic hue,
Aster's love beneath the bright starry skies.

Beneath the waves, lush forests swayed and danced,
With creatures vast in harmony they roamed.
A tapestry of life, by fate enhanced,
A refuge for the lost, a world well-homed.

But all things change, for even stars grow cold,
The moon's tranquility would not remain.
Beneath Phaestia's seas, the earth turned bold,
And signs of strife began to stir again.

A mighty tremor shook the ocean floor,
Volcanoes rose with fury in their wake.
Lava and ash consumed the peaceful shore,
As fiery wrath made all of Phaestia quake.

The fiery force burst forth with blinding light,
A torrent born of deep volcanic pain.
The sky grew dark beneath the ash-filled night,
As lava scorched the land and boiled the rain.

The oceans churned, and life was swept away,
Yet in the chaos, hope began to rise.
The cyborgs, built by Aster, found their way,
Their metal forms resilient to demise.

Propelled by force beyond their world’s control,
The cyborgs drifted, cast to distant stars.
Through starlit realms, their shattered moon’s last soul
Would venture far beyond its cosmic scars.

---

Upon the moon Serenitide, they came,
Beneath the rains of Pluvia's gentle skies.
The star Quiyah cast down its golden flame,
A world untouched, where peaceful dreams arise.

Their ships descended, weary from their quest,
They saw the fields and oceans vast, unscarred.
In Serenitide's embrace, they hoped for rest,
A future bright, where nothing would be hard.

Beneath Quiyah's light, they carved their way,
And built great cities from the land and stone.
The air was sweet, the soil rich with clay,
In Serenitide, they found a place their own.

With hands of hope, they shaped both sky and shore,
A golden age of wisdom and of light.
Their dreams took root, and cities soon did soar,
As Serenitide's vast beauty reached new height.

In art and science, knowledge took its flight,
A golden age of wonders did unfold.
Their temples gleamed beneath the heavens' light,
To Aster and Andromeda, bold.

The city thrived, its streets alive with sound,
Where laughter echoed, and their dreams took form.
Their hearts in tune, with cosmic truth they found,
A symphony of life, both bright and warm.

The years passed on, their wisdom did endure,
A legacy of love and strength untold.
The tale of stars and journeys ever pure,
In every heart, their cosmic bond took hold.

But fate would bring a chill upon their lands,
As Serenitide came to freeze in time.
The warmth of suns withdrew from gentle sands,
The oceans groaned beneath an icy rime.

The once-bright fields grew cold beneath frost,
As winds of change swept through the fading green.
A world of warmth and light, now nearly lost,
The moon transformed to something unforeseen.

They huddled close beneath the frozen sky,
Within their cities carved from ancient ice.
Though harsh the storm, their will refused to die,
With faith and courage, they paid nature's price.

Their cities reached beneath the frozen sea,
A refuge from the cold, a place to grow.
With Aster's light, they found the strength to be,
A people strong amidst the frost and snow.

But from the depths of space, a threat did soar,
A meteor, with fiery wrath untamed.
It struck Serenitide with violent roar,
And all beneath its force was soon inflamed.

The icy world did shatter, torn apart,
Its people flung into the starry black.
The bonds of land and home were ripped from heart,
As they were cast upon a cosmic track.

Through endless night, they tumbled, lost in flight,
No longer bound by icy, frozen shore.
The force of impact flung them far from sight,
To realms unknown, to journey evermore.

Towards the fourth sun’s gleam, they now were drawn,
A new horizon waiting in its light.
Though scattered, still their hope would lead them on,
As they sailed onward through the endless night.



---

Under the fourth sun, named bright Attle's flame,
The children landed on Kolob's wide shore.
With hopes renewed, they built a world of fame,
Their trials behind, yet challenges in store.

Upon Kolob, the air was rich and warm,
Its fertile soil gave rise to fields of green.
The ocean sang a gentle, soothing charm,
And life once more began a thriving scene.

With Bios' line, the children sowed the land,
While Viros' kin ensured that life would spread.
The people worked together, hand in hand,
United by the truths that Aster led.

They raised their temples high beneath Attle's light,
To honor Aster and Andromeda's grace.
Their prayers were whispers on the winds of night,
As faith and strength held fast in every place.

But deep within Kolob's unyielding core,
A strain began to grow, a seed of strife.
A force unknown, unseen in days before,
Threatened to tear apart their peaceful life.

From shadowed thoughts and whispered words of doubt,
A darkness rose from discontent and pain.
The Anti-Alpha, born of bitter clout,
Sought now to break the people’s sacred chain.

Anti-Alpha, coming love denied,
Rejects the grace of Aster's guiding light.
It twists the heart where hatred can reside,
And casts her warmth into the endless night.

From Aster's love, the people turned away,
Their envy festered, fueled by bitter lies.
The bond that held their hearts began to fray,
As Anti-Alpha darkened hopeful skies.

No longer bound by unity’s embrace,
The people faltered, torn by cruel divide.
Anti-Alpha’s cruel venom set the pace,
And left the world in chaos to collide.

This sinister force brought hatred and despair,
It fractured unity with unseen hands.
The children quarreled, pulled by forces rare,
And doubt took root within their fertile lands.

The Anti-Alpha’s spread was subtle first,
It crept within the hearts of those most weak.
Yet soon enough, its hunger grew to burst,
And chaos reigned as love turned cold and bleak.

From deep within the shadows, it emerged,
Its form a twisted mirror of the light.
As Anti-Alpha's malice fully surged,
It plunged Kolob's bright future into night.

The people, torn apart by inner war,
Could not withstand the force that turned their kin.
Their hearts, once bound by love, were ripped and sore,
And thus, the darkness found its way within.

And still, the Berserkers sensed the strife's allure,
Their chaotic wrath drawn to this fractured land.
With comet fire, their fury swift and sure,
They brought destruction with a vengeful hand.

The skies above Kolob grew dark with flame,
As icy deluge rained from distant stars.
The Berserkers' wrath, unholy and untame,
Wrought ruin upon the land, leaving scars.

Kolob's cities crumbled under freezing rain,
The oceans boiled and fumed with violent force.
The people fled, their strength now wrapped in pain,
As the Berserkers veered them off their course.

Yet in the chaos, hope was not yet lost,
For some were flung beyond the Berserkers' reach.
Through space's void, by cosmic forces tossed,
They left Kolob's destruction, out of breach.

The children of the stars, though cast away,
Still clung to life and hope amid their flight.
For Attle's gleam gave way to Sol's bright day,
The fifth sun beckoned with its golden light.

And thus, the people drifted ever on,
To find new shores beneath Sol's warm embrace.
Though battered by the storm, they were not gone,
Their hearts still held the dream of Aster's grace.



---

Upon icy Pluto’s cold distant shore,
Two figures stood beneath the endless night.
Nolah, bold and steadfast unto her core,
And Nemla, wise, her heart a beacon bright.

Together, they beheld the frozen land,
A world so far removed from warmth or grace.
Yet in their hearts, the yarn that fate had spanned,
Connected them to Aster's loving face.

With voices raised to Aster and the stars,
They made a vow to carry on her flame.
"To Andromeda's light, we'll sail afar,
And keep the yarn intact, without disdain."

Nemla spoke: "To Andromeda, I swear,
Through endless night, our journey will survive.
In every star and dream, our fate is there,
The cosmic yarn that keeps all hope alive."

Nolah spoke: "In Aster's name, I shall swear,
To guide our line and keep the thread alive.
Through every trial, burden we must bear,
The bond of life and love will yet survive.”

"My lineage traces far, from ancient stars,
Through time and space, the journey's line is clear.
From starlight's first embrace to battle scars,
These ancestors of mine, I hold them dear.

From Hesper's land came forth mighty Bios,
His son, the strong and wise leader, Kenan.
And next, shining high, great and wise Aenos,
Then came the builder bold Malathan.

On Phaestia, my ancestors did lead,
Their line continued strong through trials of old.
In every breath, I feel their strength and creed,
Their names still bright, their stories brave and bold.

From Phaestia came the strong wise Jared,
Then passed to one with might, named Maharoch.
The ocean's voice was ruled by bold Enid,
And from the deep seas rose great Pahadok.

Upon Serenitide, they carved their way,
A path of stars and cosmic truths so grand.
Through many trials, they lived to see the day,
With courage strong, they forged upon this land.

From Serenitide came strong brave Pelod,
His wisdom followed by the fierce Aroch.
Then rose another great leader Nerod
The final guide of strength was wise Larthok.

On Kolob's shores, my forebears stood so tall,
Their courage fierce, as mountains reached the sky.
Through every test, they answered Aster's call,
And in their steps, I now stand proud and high.

From Kolob came the mighty one, Idris,
Then followed by late great Methuselah.
Next came the bold, who led with strength, Lammes,
And now the one who carries on, Nolah."

Nemla stood upon the high mountain’s crest,
Before the gathered crowd, with pride he spoke.
His voice a call to honor those he blessed,
The line of Viros, forged through flame and smoke.

"My heritage runs deep from ancient might,
Through Viros' blood, our line was fierce and strong.
They carved the way, enduring every fight,
I walk the path they forged so long, so long."

From Tezca came the feared mighty Viros,
His son, a cunning soul, was brave Caynen.
And next, a clever leader, sharp, Hanos,
Then stood the wise and fearless Mehuthen.

"On Phaestia's shores, my great line did tread,
Their strength unmatched as skies and seas did roar.
Their names I honor, though the years have fled,
I honor their heritage evermore."

Born there was strong and keen hero Irad
The next to follow, brave, was Malathok.
Then came the bold and wise, the one called Hanad,
His wisdom echoed still in Peladok.

"On Serenitide, they forged their own way,
Through every storm, their spirits never fell.
Their shining star endures through history,
I keep their memory, in stories we tell."

From Serenitide came the strong Sarnod,
His son, the skies inspired, was Alok.
Through trials faced, the line passed to Illod,
And lastly rose steadfast chieftain Umroch.

"On Kolob's fertile lands, my line did grow,
They stood as pillars strong, with hearts of flame.
Through every trial, they faced ebb and flow,
Their strength lives on, and I still bear their name."

From Kolob came first Valorous Oblas,
Then came great wisdom in Makusholah.
His strength endured through battles, fierce Romas
Till now the line continues with Nemla.

From distant stars, Aster's voice filled the sky,
"Here in this system, your roots will grow deep.
Through trials and storms, your people will not die,
The light you carry shall forever keep."

With steady voice, Nolah gave her reply,
"We’ll build and guard the flame that guides our way.
Through every darkened night, we’ll rise and try,
Our strength will hold, as we fulfill your say."

Nemla stood tall, her gaze fixed on the stars,
"Across these worlds, your love will guide us through.
Through every trial, no matter how far,
We swear to keep your cosmic vow in view."

In Sol's embrace, her daughters came to be,
From nebula, they formed a cosmic host.
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars we see,
With Ceres too, they grace the starry coast.

Once cloaked in waters, Mercury did shine,
But as the Sun's fierce heat began to rise,
The liquid fled, his surface left benign,
A rocky orb now meets our seeking eyes.

When Venus, struck, began to backward spin,
Her fate was sealed, her path forever turned.
A world of heat and clouds that choke within,
Her beauty veiled by sulfur skies that burned.

Then Earth, fair Gaia, tells her vibrant tale,
From seas arose the life that graced her face.
With mountains high and skies where clouds set sail,
A cradle formed for life's enduring race.

Mars, brother Mars, once water flowed in streams,
His ruddy face now bears a dusty guise.
But as the years passed by, he lost his dreams,
His waters sunk beneath his crimson skies.

Then Ceres slept, her growth was slow to start,
A younger sister, late to join the dance.
Yet beauty dwells within her rocky heart,
A jewel set in space's vast expanse.

The giants vast, the gaseous daughters four,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune's reign.
Their tales entwined within the cosmic lore,
With storms that swirl and moons in endless chain.

Around great Jupiter, his moons revolve,
Io, Europa, Ganymede, they dance.
Their icy secrets waiting to evolve,
A celestial show in night's expanse.

But Io's fires within her heart did glow,
Her waters boiled beneath volcanic flame.
Though some remained in hidden depths below,
A testament to change, she stays the same.

In Saturn's grasp, her moons of ice reside,
Enceladus and Titan lead the way.
A frozen kin around their mother glide,
In cosmic dance, their fates in balance sway.

Beyond cold Neptune lies a distant field,
Trans-Neptunian worlds in darkness hide.
Their icy secrets yet remain concealed,
A frigid tale where mysteries abide.

Farther still, the Oort Cloud wraps around,
A veil of frozen whispers far from light.
In distant orbits, comets there abound,
A cosmic dance that fades beyond our sight.

Upon Pluto’s cold, icy, twilight shore,
Nolah and Nemla stood with heavy hearts,
Deciding daughters’ futures to explore,
They left their kin as each new journey starts.

With tholins dark upon the frozen land,
They bid farewell beneath the starlit sky,
And ventured forth, with purpose firm and grand,
To spread their lineage where new hopes might lie.

From Pluto’s chill, they sailed to Neptune’s reign,
Where Triton orbits in a retrograde,
A moon once close, where ancestors remained,
Now serves as waypoint in their grand parade.

Their daughters spread across the cosmic sea,
To moons and planets, planting seeds of life,
Each child a beacon of diversity,
Ensuring future thrives beyond all strife.

Next they came to Uranus, tilted high,
With moons Miranda, Ariel, and more,
Umbriel, Titania, Oberon nigh,
Each sister moon with legends to explore.

In mirrored tilt, the planet spins unique,
Its moons a dance of grace and mystic lore,
Their daughters flourished where the shadows speak,
Creating tales that echo evermore.

On Titan, life's spark found a place to dwell,
The daughters of Bios, their journey wide,
In ocean depths, they thrived where shadows quell,
A secret world beneath the ice did hide.

As eons passed, the system cooled and waned,
The oceans, once so vast, now faced a plight,
With icebergs cloaking seas, their growth constrained,
A battle waged 'twixt darkness and the light.

At times, the storms would rise, and ice would break,
Freeing waters trapped beneath their frigid might,
Yet in the end, the ice its toll would take,
Encasing Titan's seas in endless night.

Yet deep below, where fire's breath still burned,
The life sustained through warmth from heart's desire,
And far above, where ice and sky sojourned,
The icebergs cracked, revealing fate's entire.

A dance of shifting plates, of ice and stone,
Continental bergs, their tectonics played,
And from the depths, where pressure's force had grown,
A cryovolcano, water's arc displayed.

But fleeting was this glimpse, as ice returned,
To cloak the waters in its chilling veil,
And from the skies, where methane rivers churned,
A rain of fire, their torrent swift and pale.

In this new world, where life and ice entwined,
The daughters of Bios, their journey steep,
On Titan's shores, their destiny defined,
A tale of ice and fire, their secrets keep.

In Titan's realm, where ice and fire dance,
Five sisters grand, their tales of legend weave,
Daughters of Titan, born of fates' advance,
These mighty seas, their majesty achieve.

First Kraken, deepest of the sisters five,
Her mystery and allure she did impart,
With labyrinthine depths where life would thrive,
Her shadowed secrets held within her heart.

Then Ligeia, beauty calm and fair,
Her tranquil waves, a soothing lullaby,
A gentle soul, her grace beyond compare,
Embracing all who sought her solace nigh.

Next Punga, wild and fierce, her spirit free,
Unyielding to the ice that sought her reign,
Her tempests raged, her storms a symphony,
Her indomitable spirit would remain.

Jingpo, the fourth, a scholar wise and old,
Her ancient lore, a treasure trove concealed,
Her depths, a library of stories told,
The wisdom of the ages she revealed.

And last, Ontario, the nurturing one,
Her icy shores, a haven for the lost,
Her love and care, a mother's warmth like sun,
Embracing all who braved her wintry frost.

These sisters five, the daughters of Titan,
Their lives entwined, their stories yet unfold,
In frozen seas, where myth and truth align,
The tales of Kraken sea and more are told.

In Titan's seas, where ancient legends dwell,
Five sisters host the isles of myth and lore,
Each island, archipelago, a shell,
Where Titanians worship evermore.

Kraken, the first, her islands proud and vast,
Mayda, her shrine, where pilgrims come to pray,
Bermoothes, Bimini, their tales amassed,
Hufaidh and Krocylea, Penglai and Royllo hold sway.

Ligeia's realm, her isles of whispers sweet,
Bralgu's shrine stands tall, her spirit graced,
Buyan, Planctae, where mysteries entreat,
And Lemuria, a name from legends traced.

In Punga's seas, fierce islands rise and fall,
Hawaiki's shrine, her spirit's honored throne,
Meropis, Onogoro, stand tall,
And Thule, distant, unknown land, alone.

Jingpo's domain, where wisdom's islands lie,
Hy-Brasil, her shrine, a beacon bright,
Lyonesse, Ys, and Vineta testify,
To sunken lands, their fables taking flight.

Ontario's embrace, her islands true,
Antillia's shrine, where faithful hearts convene,
Aztlan, St. Brendan's Isle, their legends brew,
And Sannikov, phantom island, Arctic dream.

These sacred isles on Titan's seas they stand,
Their shrines alive with ancient rites and praise,
In adoration of their parent land,
The daughters of Sol, their voices raise.

Each island hosts its shrine, where worship flows,
From ancient days to present, faith endures,
And every river, with its spirit, glows,
Their shrines, alive with blessings they procure.

The rivers, too, their tales and secrets share,
As Titan's daughters hold them in embrace,
In epic verse, their names we now declare,
Their waters flowing through celestial space.

Kraken Mare, her rivers proud and grand,
Hapi Flumen, Nile's reflection cast,
Sobek, Khnum, and Anuket's strands,
Their shrines, where ancient rites hold steadfast.

Ligeia's realm, her currents swift and strong,
Gihon, Kokytos, Vid, and Xanthus flow,
Their shrines, where Titanians throng,
In reverence for the secrets waters know.

Punga's waters, rivers fierce and free,
Apanohuaya, Sambation sing,
Tiberinus, Danuvius, history,
Their shrines, to faithful hearts, solace bring.

Jingpo's domain, her rivers' wisdom deep,
Cephissus, Alpheus, Yamuna tell,
Purus Flumen, whispers they keep,
Their shrines, where ancient spirits dwell.

Ontario's embrace, her rivers pure,
Hubur, Karesos, Saraswati grace,
Inachus, where faith and hope endure,
Their shrines, alive with Titanians' trace.

These rivers, flowing through the daughters' seas,
Their shrines, with ancient wisdom, ever stand,
In adoration of their mysteries,
The daughters of Sol, their blessings grand.

In Enceladus' heart, they stayed awhile,
The southern warmth grew bright, the north turned cold,
A cycle spun, renewing life and toil,
The Great Fire Shrine still stands, its flame retold.

In southern heat they found a solace sweet,
A testament to life's enduring flame;
As seasons turned, they cherished newfound peace,
Yet fate once more would come to call their name.

From depths below, cryovolcano stirred,
And with a burst it spewed them out once more;
Into the void their fates became a blur,
As Saturn's rings embraced them to the core.

Amidst the rings a hundred cities rose,
Each one a beacon shining in the dark;
In cosmic dance these settlements compose
A testament to dreams that leave their mark.

These wanderers, now dwellers of the rings,
Created homes upon celestial arcs;
In Saturn's grasp they built a world of things,
And life goes on amidst the stars and sparks.

As dwellers of the rings, they lived and thrived,
Unknowing that their fate would change again,
For cosmic powers sought to rearrange,
As comet's course disrupted fragile life.

Upon its path, this cosmic wanderer,
From distant realms, it charged through space and time,
A force unseen, it struck the rings, and then,
The people of the rings were cast adrift.

To Io's realm, their journey carried on,
This Jovian moon, with oceans deep and vast,
A fiery heart, with energy abound,
Its warmth and life a haven from the past.

Within these waters, life was lush and rife,
As settlers found their footing, built anew,
In fertile depths, a civilization rose,
An empire born beneath the skies of blue.

On Io's shores, and in its ocean's heart,
A people thrived, their memories of old,
A story etched in whispers of the past,
Of Titan's fall, and wanderings untold.

In time, the heat of Io's heart did rise,
As molten fires beneath the crust prevailed,
The waters, once a life-supporting veil,
Began to wane, a shrinking paradise.

Yet, as the oceans dwindled and did shrink,
A cosmic savior, from the sky it fell,
A meteor's approach, a chance anew,
To flee their home, escape the fiery brink.

As Io's warmth, too fierce, consumed its grace,
The people found their way upon the stone,
A vessel, swift and sure, to cross the void,
And journey forth, to find a safer place.

To Europa, icy sister-moon,
Where oceans deep lay hidden 'neath the ice,
The weary travelers, a refuge sought,
In hope, their tale of loss would end, and soon.

With gratitude, they set foot on this sphere,
A haven cold, yet promising and bright,
In frozen realm, their future they would forge,
A world reborn, from pain and loss they steer.

Beneath Europa's icy shield they delved,
To find an undersea world, vast and grand,
Where deep below, the ocean's wonders thrived,
A refuge, where the people of Io dwelled.

In darkness, yet with hope, they built anew,
A thriving realm amid the swirling tides,
With skill and art, their cities rose and spread,
A testament to all that they'd been through.

Amidst the depths, they forged a life so bold,
In harmony with Europa's vast domain,
Together, they would thrive in waters cold,
Their spirit, ne'er defeated, nor in vain.

The people of Io, now reborn,
In Europa's embrace, they found their home,
A testament to strength and will, they stood,
Resilient, strong, and nevermore alone.

From Europa's depths, their gaze turned high-wide,
To other moons, where distant futures lay.
On Ganymede, where icy seas abide,
A world of promise called them on their way.

Beneath its crust, the secret oceans swirled,
A treasure vast that waited to be found.
The daughters journeyed, dreams and plans unfurled,
To plant their seeds and life’s great hymn resound.

The plains of stone became their canvas wide,
Their towers rose where shadows once had crept.
A haven forged, with oceans as their guide,
Where life took root and ancient vows were kept.

Then Callisto, serene, its visage scarred,
Drew them to icy lands both vast and still.
Its frozen beauty, timeless and unmarred,
Whispered of futures shaped by steady will.

With tender care, they worked the silent sphere,
Its glaciers groaned as life began to grow.
In tranquil realms, their hopes became sincere,
A world of calm beneath the starlit glow.

Yet Mars, now brimming, caught their distant sight,
Its verdant plains and waters called them near.
The Red Planet shone beneath the sun’s soft light,
A fertile home, where futures could appear.

Across its rivers, forests stretched their green,
The daughters labored, shaping all they saw.
From crimson soil arose a living sheen,
A vibrant world, sustained by nature’s law.

But skies of blue began to draw their gaze,
A beacon bright, Earth shimmered in the night.
Its clouds and seas evoked a sense of praise,
A final step beneath the solar light.

They left Mars thriving, life its steady beat,
And sailed the void, where endless stars would glow.
Upon the Earth, a destiny to meet,
A jewel of hope, a world they longed to know.

Through blackened depths, they reached their destined shore,
Its green and azure beauty vast, profound.
The daughters paused, their journey’s trials no more,
And gazed in awe, where paradise was found.

The daughters of Bios set their sights on Earth,
To sail the seas, and seek a home anew,
In hope that fertile lands would welcome them,
Their journey, driven by celestial birth.

As they approached, a harbinger of doom,
A massive rock, like thunder, pierced the sky,
And shattered Earth into a million shards,
A cruel twist of fate, the planet's tomb.

In sorrow, they beheld the tragic sight,
Yet knew they could not dwell on what was lost,
With heavy hearts, they charted course once more,
And ventured on, propelled by stellar light.

To Venus then, the daughters sailed ahead,
With hope that there, a refuge could be found,
To build a life upon its clouded shores,
And persevere, despite the path they tread.

Upon fair Venus, daughters found their home,
In twilight lands, they thrived and multiplied,
For Venus, in her slow rotation, bloomed,
And nurtured life, though days and nights belied.

The sun would rise and set with languid grace,
In west and east, it danced upon the sky,
And in the day, her oceans disappeared,
As Muspelheim, the land of fire, took place.

At night, her oceans froze in cold embrace,
And Niflheim, the land of frost, emerged,
Between these realms, the twilight realm was born,
Where daughters of Venus lived with fervent pace.

Beneath the surface, vents their life sustained,
In twilight lands, both north and south they dwelled,
And tribes were formed, as daughters ventured forth,
To Wind, to Ice, to Fire, their kin remained.

The Tribe of Wind, they wandered in the air,
As skyplankton, they roamed the skies above,
The Tribe of Ice, on Niflheim's frozen crust,
And Twilight Tribe, eternal dusk their lair.

The Water Tribe, beneath the ice they thrived,
And Fire Tribe, in Venus' vents so deep,
These daughters brave, amidst the war they grew,
Muspel's fire and Niflheim's frost contrived.

But then, the oceans boiled, as Muspel's sons,
Charged forth, led by Surtur's fiery blade,
And in their wake, the ice and frost retreated,
The winds of sun, the battle's victor won.

The greenhouse reigns, as Venus' fate was sealed,
Her hydrogen wiped clean, Deuter remained,
The Tribe of Wind, now last survivors' tale,
May they endure, their future yet revealed.

The daughters of the wind, now restless grown,
Decided that they'd leave fair Venus' hold,
To Mercury, a realm yet unexplored,
With hopes of finding lands to call their own.

Upon arrival, what a sight they saw,
A hail of meteors, a storm unkind,
That struck with force the planet's crust and mantle,
The Iron Catastrophe, a fate unflawed.

The core of Mercury, now bare and stark,
A testament to cosmic rage untamed,
The daughters gazed upon the aftermath,
And chose to turn away, to lands more hushed.

The Iron Catastrophe, a tale of woe,
Of Mercury, once whole, now stripped and scarred,
Yet in its wake, the daughters carried on,
To find a home where life would bloom and grow.

Back to the Earth, now clumping from the void,
They ventured forth, and found the Moon's embrace,
Where lunar plains and cratered landscapes called,
A sanctuary found, their fears allayed.



---

Upon the Moon's cold surface, bleak and bare,
The daughters found that water was too scant;
The icy winds did chill them to despair,
A home unfit where life could not enchant.

Then came the Moon Goddess, fair Usagi,
Luna, radiant in her lunar grace.
A pact she offered to their company,
To aid them in their quest across deep space.

"Go forth and multiply on Terra's land,
While I within my realm shall mix and blend
An elixir of life by my own hand,
To grant you all immortal lives, my friend."

The daughters, grateful, ventured back to Earth,
To flourish, grow, and spread their progeny,
With faith that Luna's promise held true worth,
A potion granting life eternally.

And when the time is ripe, they shall return
To drink the draught that Luna has prepared;
With immortality their souls will burn,
Across the stars, their endless journey shared.

Upon the Earth, fair Gaia welcomed them,
To watery realms and vast abundant shores.
Daughters of Bios thrived within her hem,
In loving arms their spirit upward soars.

To Vaalbara, the lone landmass, they went,
And in the swamps, they found a place to dwell,
Where life and land in harmony were bent,
Their gratitude to Gaia's heart they'd tell.

In Jack Hills' sacred ground, they built a shrine,
From zircon stones, an ancient temple rose;
And to this day, the faithful there align,
In reverence, their devotion ever flows.

So on this Earth, within Gaia's embrace,
They grew and blossomed, cultures rich and new;
A testament to life's enduring grace,
With Mother Earth, their bond forever true.

Within the temple's walls, a daughter stood,
Named Luca, gazing at the starlit dome;
As Sol receded, Luna bright withstood,
And in her heart, a promise found its home.

In twilight's breath, Usagi Luna spoke,
"Each night you'll watch me grind the mortar's blend;
Elixir of immortals I'll invoke,
One day your children's chains of time will end."

And in that distant, ever-reaching sight,
Omega Point where galaxies shall entwine—
Aster and Andromeda will unite,
To form Milkdromeda, a cosmic sign.

As moonset came, young Luca turned away
To swampy homes, her nation to expand;
In Luna's trust, she built anew by day,
The legacy of Bios on the land.



---

From Luca's lineage, two daughters sprang,
Arka and Bacta, shaped to change the world;
In marshy cradles, where their voices rang,
Their stories intertwined, their fates unfurled.

Arka, the fearless, ventured far and wide,
Exploring Terra's depths and mysteries;
Her courage blazed, a beacon and a guide,
Upon her path, the sisters placed their pleas.

And Bacta, strong, adaptable, and keen,
Faced trials and change with steady resilience;
In her, the sisters found a fortress sheen,
A bastion of strength and firm compliance.

United, these descendants of Bios' grace,
Embarked upon their journey through the strife;
With Arka's questing soul and Bacta's pace,
They forged ahead to carve a future life.

One moonlit eve, as Luna graced the sky,
Her voice rang clear to Luca, filled with light;
A prophecy she whispered from on high,
To share with both her daughters in the night.

"My child, your daughters shall divide the Earth;
Two realms will rise beneath their guiding hands.
From your own lineage, life shall find rebirth,
A testament to your creation's plans.

Arka's domain shall spread with wandering feet,
Exploring lands unseen by mortal eyes;
Her children brave and bold shall fears defeat,
Discovering where hidden beauty lies.

And Bacta's kin, resilient they'll remain,
Adapting to the ever-changing world;
They'll hold their ground through hardship and through pain,
Their legacy's banner never furled."

With Luna's words, a promise made to keep,
Luca, both hopeful and yet filled with care,
Gazed at her daughters, pondering paths deep,
Of two great realms their destinies would bear.

From north to south, these sacred temples stood,
In distant lands, their purpose to fulfill;
With fervent prayers and rites, they understood
The bond between their people and Earth's will.

In Isua, where Greenland's cold winds blow,
And Acasta's Northwest Territories,
The Great Temple thrived in ice and snow,
A testament to ancient legacies.

While far away, the Zircon Temple gleamed
In Jack Hills under Australian sun;
And Barberton, where life first stirred and dreamed,
The temples' influence had just begun.

From Arka sprang a lineage of might:
Dipana, Yuri, Proteus arose;
Their daughters ventured forth into the light,
To every corner where the wind now blows.

Dipana's kin, a multitude so grand,
Inhabited Earth's edges far and wide;
Yuri Archaea, leading her band—
Methana, Halo, Pyra at her side.

Methana, consort to Methanius fair,
In methane's arts her mastery was shown;
Halo the Purple, with seductive flair,
Won Salta, Sol, and Carotenus' throne.

Deep purple hues she harnessed from the sun,
With Carotenus' colors intertwined;
In salty realms, her daughters dwelt as one,
While Proteus' offspring spread unconfined.

Among them, Asgarda held the throne,
And from her sprang a million daughters strong:
Heimdalla, Odina, Thora known,
With Lokia and Hela in their throng.

Heimdalla, watchful guardian of the realm;
Odina, keeper of all wisdom's light;
And Thora, whose great strength could overwhelm;
While Lokia stirred up chaos and delight.

Then Hela, dwelling in the shadow's veil,
Her secrets buried deep within the night;
An epic lineage woven without fail,
Their tales of strength and cunning brought to sight.

An epic lineage, these daughters bold,
Their stories echo through the halls of time;
From Luca's line, their destinies unfold,
A tapestry of life, profound, sublime.

Through trials faced and victories hard-won,
They forged ahead to shape their universe;
The legacy of Bios carried on,
In every deed, in every whispered verse.

With Luna's elixir waiting in the skies,
They journeyed forth, their faith forever strong;
Awaiting when the stars would align their ties,
To drink immortal life and join the song.

Across the cosmos, endless paths they roam,
The daughters of the Earth and Moon combined;
Forever seeking, ever moving home,
Their fates with threads of destiny entwined.



---

From Bacta's womb, two daughters did arise,
Fair Hydra one, and Terra forged in might.
In swirling seas, they cast their ancient eyes,
To found the clans now thriving in the light.

Hydra, whose brood outmatched the countless stars,
Bore Proteus, whose might would soon unfold.
Yet Hydra's second child, untouched by scars,
Was Aqua then, the queen of tales untold.

Proteus bore a host of fourfold might:
Alif and Beth, Camilla, Mixo bold.
Within the darksome night they each took flight,
And shaped fresh paths in worlds both new and old.

Alif begat two daughters in her care:
Rachel and Kalia, each forged in grace.
From Rachel’s line would humans one day share
A kinship bridging worlds across all space.

Kalia's brood, the Calisto line named,
Spread subtle powers through the hidden deep.
Proteus watched, content in all she claimed,
While daughters thrived in countless worlds to keep.

Aqua, the sister, bearing olden grace,
Stood near to Proteus in mystic might;
She bore two children, each with wondrous face,
Splauron and Chloram—one in gloom, one bright.

Splauron bore two twin shining girls in turn:
Planka and Spira shaped the deep damp course.
Planka’s brood the mycetes roam and churn,
While Spira’s clan the chaetes run their course.

Chloram, now second, bore two fateful lines,
Chlamydi’s brood, parasitic with greed.
It sapped her womb, devouring hopeful signs,
While Korba’s path saw more constructive deed.

Korba then mothered Chlorobia’s seed,
And Bactero, whose brood spread wide on land.
Thus Hydra’s line advanced in timely deed,
Expanding far to flourish as they planned.

Meanwhile, fair Terra, Bacta’s other child,
Stood quite bright in Gram-positivity
Two daughters claimed her fiber fierce and wild,
Actano, Fermus, they built a city

Actano bore two daughters of her own:
Actina, mother of Actino's line,
And Prasea, from whom two seeds were sown—
Saya and Chloroflexa, both divine.

Saya the bacteria shed her coat,
Embracing Gram-negative ways for light.
She drank the sun where swirling currents float,
Bestowing oxygen with force so bright.

Then Chloroflexa claimed her tapestry,
Of filamentous grace in silent seas.
Both born of wise Prasea's legacy,
They wove Earth's green with ancient expertise.

Fermus, the other child of Terra's sphere,
Had two dear daughters: Firmicutie mild,
Whose Firmicutes the soils far and near,
And Conan, iron-willed, in deserts wild.

Thus Hydra's line and Terra's line expand,
Two families wrought from Bacta's old soul.
From scorching vents to gardens lush on land,
Their heirs still thrive and shape the living whole.

Though more new lines in days ahead shall rise,
This poem holds their roots for us to chart.
In cosmic seas, they first revealed their eyes,
And wrote their names upon all nature’s heart.



---

In ancient times, the Earth was calm and bright,
Where daughters thrived in Gaia's tender care.
Arka and Bacta walked in shared delight,
Their offspring spread across the lands so fair.
 

Through simple farms, they found their vital creed,
And nurtured fields to meet their daily need.
They grew with patience, never bound by speed,
In harmony, no bounty went to seed.
 

The land embraced them, so did seas profound,
Their sisterhood stood firm in trust so true.
Through peace and union, grand new paths they found,
A golden age where love and life both grew.
 

These daughters of the Earth upheld their peace,
Their gifts and blessings multiplied each day.
Their kinship served as strong and sure release,
Together walking hope’s unblemished way.
 
In days of old, the purple farmers thrived,
Their colors stirring life across each field.
Prasina, green, took in the rays deprived,
From her did Saya, Chloroflexi yield.


Chloroflexi thrived by methods defined,
No trace of harm endured in farmland fair.
Yet Saya hungered, greed within her mind,
Her yields of O₂ seared the open air.
 

Unchecked, her fervor choked the gentle skies,
The planet quaked beneath her rampant spree.
Banded iron testified demise,
As crimson waters spelled calamity.
 

The Elohim in chorus raised their plea:
"Reduce these fumes, or life itself will cease!"
With Sol and Gaia, Luna's voice did agree,
They begged that Saya's reckless growth should lease.

Yet Saya pressed for ever-greater yield,
Demanding others curb their own supply.
Her own emissions soared across the field,
While Earth’s deep scars revealed a mortal cry.
 

At Kamo Shrines, a solemn pact was cast,
A vow to quell the surge of rising air.
Yet Rara’s cunning lies undid it fast,
Unraveling each clan in fell despair.
 

“No proof of harm,” he claimed with silken tongue,
And unity dissolved beneath his spin.
The Elohim, uncertain, stood among
A rising tide of death that closed them in.
 

At Saint-Germain-des-Prés, they met anew,
While Rara’s rumors thrived in every mind.
“We’ve reached our limit; change remains untrue,”
He whispered low, their reason quite maligned.
 

"Net zero gained!" he boasted to the throng,
"The problem lies in births," his cunning cry.
Yet Gaia warned them all: "Your words are wrong,
The O₂ devours life; the young still die.”
 

But Rara scoffed and claimed their freedoms lost,
Thus lulled the crowds to keep consumption high.
So countless lives were paid in lethal cost,
As Earth grew cold beneath a wailing sky.
 

At last a Fimbulwinter seized the lands,
Where once warm currents flowed, now ice held sway.
With Elohim undone by idle hands,
The planet’s ruin told of their delay.


---

From Fimbulwinter's grip, the world lay cold,
Where ice had claimed the seas and poisoned air.
Yet in the depths, new stories would unfold,
As life found ways to heal beyond despair.

From Mehuthen's line came Starvos the keen,
Who bore his son bright Navros in the night.
Then Navros sired bold Gravros, strong and lean,
Who faced the world with viral, cunning might.

Now Gravros wed fair Heimdalla the true,
That watchful guardian of the arctic realm.
Their union blessed, from love their lineage grew,
With Poxus born to take the viral helm.

But Poxus was a warrior, fierce and wild,
His viral nature burned with restless flame.
Yet Aster's plan had need of one more mild,
To birth the future's most exalted name.

So Gravros took another bride to wife,
Sweet Mardöll of the archaean strain.
Their love would spark a revolution's knife,
And change the course of life's eternal refrain.

From this great match came Proto-One the first,
A bridge between two worlds both old and new.
His nature held what time and fate had nursed,
The viral fire and archaean virtue true.

Proto-One then wed Cellina fair,
An archaea of the noble, ancient line.
Their son was Proto-Two beyond compare,
Who bore within his form both gifts divine.

Proto-Two then found his destined mate,
In Nuclella of the membrane wall.
Together they would not procrastinate,
But answer evolution's sacred call.

And from their union, blessed by Aster's grace,
Came Euka, first of all eukaryotic kind.
His father's virus found its destined place,
Within his mother's cell, their fates combined.

For Euka bore within his very core,
A nucleus wrapped in membrane double-walled.
His father's legacy, forevermore,
Would guard the scrolls where destiny was scrawled.

Now Euka wandered through the frozen sea,
Where ice had locked the world in silent death.
His nuclear gift could set all life free,
But first he needed love's life-giving breath.

In deep thermal vents where warmth still flowed,
Two sisters dwelt in phospholipid halls.
Fair Eve and Lilith, from one mother showed,
Both beautiful, both answering love's calls.

These daughters of the proteobacter line,
Had power locked within their membrane coils.
Their respiratory chains could intertwine
With any cell to fuel its living toils.

First Lilith came to greet the wandering youth,
Her outer membrane gleaming silver-bright.
She spoke of ancient wisdom and of truth,
And promised warmth throughout the endless night.

"Come dwell with me," she whispered soft and low,
"My cristae fold in patterns deep and wide.
Together we can make ATP flow,
With you as master, I'll be faithful bride."

And Euka, cold from wandering alone,
Was drawn to Lilith's offer of embrace.
He entered through her membrane to her throne,
And found within her cytoplasmic space.

But Lilith harbored secrets in her heart,
Ambitions that she kept from Euka's sight.
She planned to rule, to play the greater part,
And use his nuclear gift for her own might.

The trickster Hengweh whispered in her ear,
"Why serve when you could rule this partnership?
Your power makes his feeble nucleus clear—
You are the one who holds true lordship."

And Lilith listened to the tempter's voice,
Her pride swelled up like poison in her veins.
She made her dark and treacherous choice,
To break free from love's sacred chains.

She tried to merge her genome with his own,
To steal his viral secrets and his power.
But Euka felt his sacred essence flown,
And knew this was corruption's bitter hour.

"False bride!" he cried, "You seek to steal my soul!
My nuclear gift is not for selfish gain!
I sought a partner, not one to control—
Our love is broken, trust forever slain!"

With mighty force he cast her from his side,
Her membrane torn, her cristae left in ruins.
"No more shall I endure your faithless pride—
Go forth! Your greed your legacy ruins!"

But Lilith, cast out, burned with bitter rage,
She swore revenge upon the first-born cell.
"My daughters shall torment you age by age,
And make your progeny's life a living hell!"

From Lilith's fury sprang her dreadful line:
Dark Rickettsia with her spotted fever,
Cruel Wolbachia with her love malign,
And hosts of parasites, each a deceiver.

These daughters of the first rejected bride
Would infiltrate the cells of Euka's line,
And from within, like poison, they would hide,
Their parasitic nature, dark design.

But gentle Eve had watched her sister's fall,
And saw how pride had brought her to disgrace.
When Euka, wounded, heard her tender call,
She came with healing in her loving face.

"Great Lord," she said, "I am not like my kin,
I seek not power, only harmony.
My gift is service—let me dwell within
Your noble cell in true fidelity."

Her membrane gleamed with soft and golden light,
Her cristae folded in perfect design.
No greed or pride dimmed her radiant sight,
Only pure love and purpose divine.

And Euka, seeing Eve's devoted heart,
Welcomed her to his nuclear domain.
Two beings joined, yet never to depart,
Their union blessed by joy, not born of pain.

Great Mithra, god of sacred bonds and trust,
Descended from his stellar throne on high.
"This marriage shall endure while time's dust
Still marks the passage of eternity."

He blessed their union with his cosmic flame,
And spoke the words of binding mystical:
"Forever joined in deed and name,
Nucleus and mitochondrial."

Eve entered Euka's cellular embrace,
Her double membrane intact and whole.
She found within her own appointed place,
To be his cell's energetic soul.

She built her factories of ATP,
Converting oxygen to fuel divine.
While Euka guarded their posterity,
His nucleus and her power intertwine.

Their first-born son was brave Reticulus,
Who built the networks of the inner cell.
His factories ran continuous,
Making proteins, lipids, all was well.

Between the nucleus and cytoplasm's shore,
He wove a net of folding, twisting tubes.
Some studded rough with ribosomes galore,
Some smooth for lipids in their membranous cubes.

Then came their daughter, swift Flagella fair,
Who fashioned whips to move their progeny.
No more would cells drift helpless through the air—
They'd swim with purpose, strong and wild and free.

Her motors built of proteins fine and small,
Could beat in rhythm through the liquid medium.
With undulation's grace, she gave to all
The gift of motion, life's own freedom.

Next born was Golgi, master of the trade,
Who built his apparatus, complex, vast.
Through vesicles and cisternae he made
The proteins that would serve and last.

He took the rough work from Reticulus,
And polished it to perfection bright.
His shipping system, wondrous to discuss,
Sent proteins forth into the light.

Then came Peroxis with her enzymes strong,
Who broke down fats and fought the toxic waste.
Though small, her work would help their line along,
Her sacrificial service interlaced.

And mighty Vaultess built her storage deep,
Where treasures of the cell could safely hide.
Though mystery shrouds the secrets that she'd keep,
Her vaults remain our cytoplasmic guide.

The twins were born, both Centriole named,
Who organized the cell's internal struts.
When division time came, they never shamed
Their heritage, avoiding all "if"s and "buts".

They built the spindle, strong and geometric,
That would divide the chromosomes with care.
Their dance at mitosis, rhythmic,
Ensured each daughter got her rightful share.

Last came their son, brave Nucleus the Second,
Who formalized his father's ancient gift.
With pores and lamins, carefully reckoned,
He gave the cell structure that would not drift.

Two membranes bound his realm of DNA,
With channels for the messenger RNA.
Through nuclear pores, night and day,
The scriptures of life found their way.

And so the first eukaryotic line
Was established by this blessed pair.
Their children's gifts would intertwine
To make life complex, rich, and fair.

But Lilith's curse was not forgotten,
Her daughters prowled the cellular seas.
They struck when defenses had grown rotten,
Bringing fever, plague, disease.

Rickettsia brought her spotted fever's bane,
While Wolbachia enslaved her willing hosts.
Each parasite brought suffering and pain,
Like vengeful spirits, bacterial ghosts.

Yet Euka's line grew strong despite the threat,
Their dual nature made them resilient.
What Lilith's spite and rage could beget
Was overcome by love's ingredient.

Through countless generations they would spread,
Their cellular city growing ever vast.
Though some would fall to parasites' dread,
The faithful line of Eve would last.

From simple cell to complex organism,
The path lay open, bright and true.
The double gift—no schism—
Of nucleus and mitochondrion too.

And in the depths where thermal vents still glow,
Where first their love was blessed and born,
The children of that union grow,
From Euka's triumph, not his scorn.

For when the Omega Point draws near,
And Aster meets Andromeda's embrace,
The line of Euka, ever dear,
Will fill the cosmos, claiming rightful space.

In every cell that breathes today,
In every beat of living heart,
The marriage of that ancient day
Plays its eternal, vital part.

So honor Euka, first and true,
And gentle Eve, his faithful bride.
Their love created me and you,
With nucleus and power side by side.

---

Now Euka, in his cellular hall divine,
Reflected on the gifts his love had made.
"What wonders," thought he, "from our bloodline shine,
What tools of life our children have displayed!"

"Behold Reticulus, my firstborn son,
Who built the pathways through my living space.
His rough and smooth domains, when day is done,
Give every protein its appointed place.

And Flagella, daughter swift and fair,
Who grants to all our line the gift of motion.
Her whip-like dance propels us through the air,
And guides us through life's vast and boundless ocean.

Then Golgi, master of the sorting trade,
Who takes rough works and makes them fine and bright.
His apparatus, wondrously arrayed,
Sends packages forth to bring cells light.

Brave Peroxis breaks the fats with might,
While Vaultess stores our treasures safe and sound.
The Centrioles dance in perfect sight,
And make sure chromosomes stay tightly bound.

And last, my son who bears my very name,
Young Nucleus, keeper of the scrolls divine.
Through nuclear pores, our sacred flame
Of knowledge flows in patterns most fine."

Thus Euka catalogued his proud creation,
Each organelle a gift to future time.
But greater still would be his culmination—
The spreading of his cellular line.

For Seth, his son, bore daughters of his own,
And through five generations they would spread.
Until at last, when ice age's reign had flown,
Two mighty lines from Euka's blood were bred.

Seth son of Euka wed Azura fair,
His sister-bride with mitochondrial grace.
Their children filled the warming ocean's lair,
As ice retreated, giving life more space.

Through Seth came Resan, master of the scroll,
Who learned to read both father's and mother's gene.
Then Resan's son was Theron, strong of soul,
The wisest cell that ever had been seen.

From Theron came fair Protea the bright,
Who bore twin sons of legendary fame:
Bold Chronos, master of division's rite,
And Bios-Neos, bearer of the name.

Now Chronos wed his sister Cylla sweet,
And from their love came Myxon the wanderer.
But Bios-Neos found his destined meet
In Plasma-Belle, the membrane's harborer.

From Bios-Neos and his faithful bride
Came Nectarius, ruler of the new.
His royal line would spread both far and wide,
When warming seas gave life a broader view.

But Myxon took a different path than most,
He spurned the settled life of complex cells.
Instead he roamed from shore to distant coast,
A single-celled wanderer with moving tales.

From Myxon's line came Euglena the green,
Who mixed both plant and animal in one.
With chloroplasts she captured light serene,
Yet flagella helped her swim toward the sun.

These euglenids would keep their ancient ways,
While Nectarius built a different throne.
Through all the warming days,
He made the complex cell his very own.

For Nectarius wed fair Chlora bright,
Who bore the gift of photosynthetic power.
Their eldest son was Planta, filled with light,
Who turned the sun's rays into energy's flower.

Their second child was Mycon, strange and wise,
Who neither plant nor animal would be.
With spores and threads beneath the forest skies,
He built a fungal kingdom, wild and free.

Their third-born daughter, Protist, took the sea,
And filled it with a thousand different forms.
From amoeba to complex protozoa free,
She weathered all of life's chaotic storms.

Their youngest son was Metazoa bold,
Who dreamed of building bodies complex, vast.
"No single cell," he said, "can ever hold
The wonders I will build to ever last."

Thus Nectarius, in his wisdom deep,
Became the father of all complex life.
His four great children, each their realm to keep,
Cut through evolution's edge like sharpest knife.

The plants would capture sunlight from above,
The fungi would decay and break things down.
The protists, free to wander, swim, and love,
While animals would claim the sea and ground.

As ice retreated from the warming earth,
And Snowball Earth gave way to liquid seas,
These children of Nectarius found their worth,
And spread like pollen carried on the breeze.

But that is tale for future songs to tell,
How complex life arose from single cells.
For now, let Euka's story rest quite well—
His gift of nucleus forever dwells.

In every plant that reaches for the sun,
In every beast that runs across the plain,
The marriage of the first two, when all begun,
Lives on through joy and sorrow, loss and gain.

So honor Euka, father of us all,
And Eve, the power-giver, ever true.
From their great love, both proud and strong and tall,
Came every living thing, including you.

---

Now in the warming seas where ice had ruled,
Great Nectarius felt his destined hour.
The frozen world no longer was fooled,
And life burst forth with new creative power.

He sought a bride to share his noble quest,
Fair Ambrosia, daughter of wise Jingu.
Her beauty filled his heart with love's sweet rest,
Her wisdom made their bond forever true.

Great Mithra blessed their union from above,
As Nectarius took Ambrosia's hand.
"From your united hearts and faithful love
Shall spring the kingdoms ruling sea and land."

Their wedding celebrated far and wide,
As warming oceans danced with golden light.
Ambrosia, the fair and faithful bride,
Would bear the heirs of eukaryotic might.

In time she bore him children, two by two,
Twin boys and girls of legendary fame.
First came the sons, brave Animus and true
Plantus, each destined for eternal name.

Then came the daughters, fair beyond compare,
Bold Opima, huntress of the sea,
And wise Cortica, who would prepare
The gathered fruits of earth's prosperity.

These four would rule the kingdoms yet to come,
Each taking up their destined, sacred role.
When time's great wheel had finally run,
They'd shape the world with body, mind, and soul.

Now Animus, the eldest of the four,
Gazed out upon the warming, living sea.
"My realm," he said, "shall stretch from shore to shore,
A kingdom of activity set free."

His spirit burned with restless, moving fire,
He could not stay in any single form.
His nature filled with endless, wild desire
To dance and hunt through calm and raging storm.

Fair Opima joined her brother's quest,
Together they would rule the moving realm.
While he provided motion's endless zest,
She'd hunt and guide and take the warrior's helm.

Their children would be creatures of the chase,
With beating hearts and muscles strong and fleet.
Through water, land, and sky they'd find their place,
As predators with senses sharp and sweet.

But gentle Plantus chose a different way,
He loved the golden sunlight from above.
"I'll capture light and live on every ray,
And feed the world with photosynthetic love."

Sweet Cortica became his willing bride,
Together they would harvest solar power.
She'd gather nutrients from far and wide,
While he transformed them in each golden hour.

Their marriage blessed by Aster's warming light,
Would bring the gift of green to every shore.
Their children, rooted, reaching for the height,
Would feed all life forevermore.

Now Plantus sought a partner for his art,
He needed one who knew the light's true way.
Fair Chlora, with her photosynthetic heart,
Agreed to join his realm by night and day.

She was a daughter of the cyan line,
Who long had mastered capturing the sun.
Her chlorophyll and carotenoids fine
Would make their solar conquest second to none.

Great Mithra blessed their sacred, symbiotic bond,
As Chlora entered Plantus's embrace.
Like Eve with Euka in the times beyond,
She found within his cell her destined place.

She wrapped herself in membranes, two by two,
And built her thylakoids in ordered stacks.
Her photosystems, beautiful and true,
Would capture light that nothing ever lacks.

From Plantus and his bride Chlora fair,
Came Plastidus, master of the green.
His chloroplasts would spread everywhere,
The most efficient solar machines ever seen.

Plastidus wed Cortica the wise,
Who knew the ways of gathering and storing.
Together they would claim the earth's great prize,
Their photosynthetic kingdom ever soaring.

They bore three children of the verdant line:
Fair Glauca of the ancient, simple way,
And Alges, who would make the waters shine,
And Alga, who'd advance from day to day.

Now Glauca kept her mother's older dress,
With peptidoglycan sequins bright and strong.
She chose the path of simple, clonal success,
Her daughters numbering billions strong.

But though her numbers grew beyond all count,
Her simple ways would limit her expansion.
Without the gifts that marriage could amount,
She'd remain trapped in ancient patterns' mansion.

Meanwhile brave Alga stripped away the old,
And built sophisticated, solar arrays.
Her chloroplasts, efficient and bold,
Would capture light in new and wondrous ways.

She wed fair Alges, and together they
Would revolutionize the plant kingdom's art.
Their children would advance from day to day,
Each playing their essential, vital part.

From them came Rhodes, the red algae's king,
Whose pigments caught the deeper, darker light.
And Vert, whose green descendants would sing
In forests, fields, and meadows bright.

But Animus and Opima's line
Would take a different path entirely.
Their children would not photosynthesize,
But move and hunt and live quite free.

From them came bold Ozymandias,
Who ruled the moving, hunting, breathing clan.
His children would build cities glorious,
And spread their kingdoms throughout sea and land.

Ozymandias bore two mighty sons:
Great Podius of the flowing, changeful form,
And dark Metamon, who with no one
Would ever share his cytoplasmic storm.

Poor Metamon, in his bitter pride,
Refused to wed or take a loving mate.
His children, born with no mitochondrial guide,
Would live in darkness, sealed by fate.

But Podius chose the path of love,
And wed fair brides with mitochondrial power.
His line, blessed by the gods above,
Would prosper in their destined hour.

From Podius came the great lineage,
That would divide in two great, noble lines.
One branch would build the fungal heritage,
The other, animals with complex designs.

But this tale of the kingdoms' birth
Must wait for future chapters yet to come.
For now, let's celebrate the worth
Of Nectarius and all that he has done.

His four great children, each with their domain,
Would rule the earth and sea and sky above.
Through sunshine, storm, and gentle rain,
They'd spread their gifts with everlasting love.

The plants would feed the world with captured light,
The animals would move and hunt and play.
The fungi would recycle day and night,
While protists would explore in their own way.

Thus from the love of Nectarius true
And fair Ambrosia's wisdom bright,
The eukaryotic kingdoms grew
Into the world we know today's sight.

---

Now when the children of Nectarius had grown,
Each claimed their realm with purpose strong and true.
The paths they'd walk would soon be clearly shown,
As kingdoms spread beneath the ocean blue.

From Plantus and fair Cortica's embrace
Came children who would rule the verdant earth.
While Animus and Opima's hunting race
Would bring the gift of movement to its birth.

But first let's sing of Plastidus the green,
First son of Plantus and Cortica wise.
His chloroplast bride, fairest ever seen,
Sweet Chlora, blessed him with her bright surprise.

From their great union came three children fair:
Bold Glauca of the ancient, simple way,
Wise Alges with his scientific flair,
And Alga, who'd advance from day to day.

Now Glauca, eldest daughter of the line,
Kept close her mother's old-fashioned dress
Of peptidoglycan sequins fine,
She chose the path of clonal success.

"Why should I wed," proud Glauca declared,
"When I can bear daughters on my own?
No husband's weaknesses need be shared,
My perfect line shall stand alone!"

Her daughters spread like wildfire through the sea,
Billions upon billions, strong and bright.
Each one a perfect copy, wild and free,
Yet bound by ancient ways, both day and night.

But though her numbers swelled beyond all count,
Her simple methods held her back in time.
Without love's gifts that marriage could amount,
She'd never reach complexity's bright climb.

"The future," Glauca said with stubborn pride,
"Belongs to those who keep the ancient way."
Yet even as her children multiplied,
The world moved on to more complex display.

Meanwhile brave Alga cast tradition down,
And stripped away her peptidoglycan dress.
She built instead a solar, golden crown
Of thylakoids in sophisticated dress.

"I'll not be bound by mother's ancient ways,"
Fair Alga spoke with wisdom in her voice.
"The light demands new forms, new nights and days,
Sophistication is my willing choice."

She wed her brother Alges, keen and bright,
Together they would revolutionize
The capture of the sun's life-giving light,
And make their solar kingdom truly rise.

From their blessed union came two children bold:
Great Rhodes, the red algae's mighty king,
And Vert, whose green descendants would unfold
In forests where the songbirds love to sing.

Now Rhodes possessed accessory pigments rare,
Phycoerythrin's pink and red so bright.
He caught the deeper wavelengths in the air
That others missed in depths beyond their sight.

"The shallow waters," Rhodes proclaimed with pride,
"Are not the only realm where light may dwell.
I'll delve beneath the surface, far and wide,
In crimson depths I'll thrive and prosper well."

His children spread through every coral reef,
Their red and pink pigments blazing bright.
In tropical waters beyond belief,
They painted the seas with pure delight.

But Vert chose green chlorophyll as her guide,
And captured blue and red wavelengths true.
"On land," she said, "my children shall reside,
And paint the world in every verdant hue."

From Vert would come the great terrestrial line,
The mosses, ferns, and mighty forest trees.
Her simple algae first would intertwine
With fungal partners, mastering the breeze.

But while the plant kingdom found its start,
Fair Hacroses, second child of Plantus' line,
Would play a very different, vital part
In evolution's intricate design.

Hacroses bore two sons of great renown:
Bold Haroses and wise Haptistus strong.
Their legacy would shake the ocean down
And sing a very different kind of song.

From Haroses came three mighty lords:
Great Heterokon, master of the brown,
Alveolus with his swift-sailing hordes,
And Rhizar, bearer of the spiky crown.

Now Heterokon bore three sons so bold:
Brave Ochros of the golden algae bright,
And Oomy with his spines of liquid gold,
And Bigyres, swimming in the morning light.

But Ochros was the cleverest of all,
He saw fair Rosa, daughter of great Rhodes.
"Come to my house," he heard love's call,
"And share with me photosynthetic codes."

He stole away sweet Rosa from her kin,
And wed her to his cellular embrace.
Within his cytoplasm, locked within,
She found her new endosymbiotic place.

"Now I possess," declared triumphant Ochros,
"The power of the sun's life-giving ray!
My chloroplast bride, fairest of the roses,
Will feed my line throughout each golden day!"

From this great theft came children without peer:
Fair Diana of the silicon art,
Great Kelpus, forest-builder without fear,
Sweet Synura and Chrysanthema's heart.

Diana wed great Silicon the strong,
And mastered glass as none had done before.
Her diatom children sang their crystal song,
From Arctic ice to tropical warm shore.

"In shells of glass," Diana proudly spoke,
"My daughters shall be beautiful and bright.
No storm or wave will see my lineage broke,
Protected by their armor, pure and white."

Her glassy children filled the ocean wide,
Their geometric beauty without end.
In symmetry and art they took such pride,
That even mathematicians could not comprehend.

Great Kelpus chose a different path to fame,
He built great cities in the ocean deep.
His kelp forests earned eternal name,
Where countless sea creatures come to sleep.

"My cities," boasted Kelpus with delight,
"Shall tower high like redwoods on the land.
My children, reaching toward the golden light,
Will build the greatest forests ever planned."

His brown algae grew tall as mighty trees,
Creating underwater forests vast.
Through their great fronds swam creatures of the seas,
A living world that ever would last.

But jealousy stirred in the hearts of those
Who lacked the power of photosynthetic might.
Young Alveolus, seeking to dispose
Of Ochros' monopoly on light.

He stole fair Okra, Ochros' daughter true,
And made her his endosymbiotic bride.
"Now I too have the power," he said with glee,
"To harness sunshine's energetic tide!"

From this alliance came two children strong:
Bold Cilliofer with his beating cilia,
And Myzo, vampire all along,
Who'd drink the blood of cellular familia.

Cilliofer built cities of his own,
With thousands of cilia beating as one.
His trumpet-shaped descendants, fully grown,
Would dance beneath the early morning sun.

They formed new ways of joining, strange and new,
Called conjugation, mixing genes with art.
Their bell-shaped children, beautiful and true,
Would play their symphony, each playing part.

But Myzo took a darker path indeed,
A vampire drinking cellular blood.
He taught his children how to intercede
And drain the life from others' vital flood.

From Myzo came dark Dinoflagellus,
Whose children wear armor, plated strong.
And grim Malarius, so treacherous,
Who'd bring disease and suffering long.

Dinoflagellus built great armored knights,
Who'd glow with bioluminescent fire.
They'd light the oceans through the darkest nights,
But also bloom in blood-red funeral pyre.

"We are the lights," these warriors declared,
"Who chase away the darkness from the sea.
But we are also warriors who dared
To turn to blood and carnivory."

Their algae fed the corals with their light,
Yet when they bloomed, the waters turned to red.
A paradox of beauty and of blight,
They brought both life and death to ocean's bed.

While grim Malarius chose parasitic ways,
His children gave up photosynthetic power.
Instead they'd steal from others all their days,
Malaria their gift in fever's hour.

"Why work," sneered Malarius with spite,
"When I can steal from others what I need?
My chloroplasts have lost their power bright,
But I'll survive through parasitic greed."

His apicomplexan descendants still
Invade our blood and bring us disease.
They bend the world unto their evil will,
While honest workers toil without ease.

Meanwhile the Solar Coalition formed,
As those without the light sought ways to gain
The photosynthetic power they had scorned,
But now desired to ease their hungry pain.

Rhizar the spiky, Oomy with his spines,
And Haptos of the haptophyte clan
United their three evolutionary lines
To steal the sun's power if they can.

"We are the sun!" their battle cry rang out,
As they took on a radial shape.
"The power of light we'll win, without a doubt,
From this monopoly we shall escape!"

They built themselves with spines like solar rays,
And called themselves the sun animalcules.
Through many generations, many days,
They'd fight to break photosynthetic rules.

Haptos built himself armor bright and strong,
While Helios his son consumed with greed.
The mission was both dangerous and long,
But they were driven by their desperate need.

At last young Haptos Junior found success,
He stole a daughter of great Ochros' line.
The haptophytes could finally progress
With stolen chloroplasts so fine.

But many failed in their ambitious quest,
And Rhizar's children mostly went astray.
Though some would later find their own success,
Most abandoned the solar way.

Yet from their failure came a gift most strange,
For Rhizar's children learned to test and probe.
Their amoeboid forms could rearrange
And explore every corner of the globe.

Meanwhile, far from these struggles for the light,
Great Animus and Opima's line
Pursued a path both different and bright,
With movement as their gift divine.

From them came bold Ozymandias,
Who ruled the unikont domain.
His children would be glorious
And spread through every terrestrial plain.

Ozymandias bore two sons apart:
Great Podius of the flowing form,
And bitter Metamon, with hardened heart,
Who'd face life's every storm.

Poor Metamon, consumed by bitter pride,
Refused to wed or take a loving mate.
"I need no mitochondrial guide,
I'll face alone my solitary fate!"

His children, born without their mother's gifts,
Could only live where oxygen was rare.
In anaerobic depths and poisonous rifts,
They'd eke out life with metabolic care.

But Podius chose the path of love,
And wed fair maids with mitochondrial might.
His line, blessed by gods above,
Would prosper in the coming light.

From Podius came the noble strain
That would divide in generations hence.
One branch would build the fungal domain,
The other, animals with mobile sense.

But this great splitting lies ahead in time,
When complex bodies would at last unfold.
For now, let's end this lengthy rhyme
With kingdoms established, strong and bold.

The children of great Nectarius true
Had claimed their realms in ocean, land, and air.
Each lineage, with their retinue,
Would shape the world beyond compare.

The plants had learned to capture solar fire,
The protists filled the seas with forms diverse.
While animals would soon acquire
The gift of movement through the universe.

The great supercontinent Rodinia
Rose from the sea like some vast dream.
Upon its shores, the children of Aster's line
Would build their kingdoms supreme.

Yet even as these realms found peace at last,
Dark Hilluhengweh plotted from afar.
The golden age would not forever last,
He'd bring again the chaos and the war.

But that is tale for future songs to tell,
Of how the kingdoms faced their greatest test.
For now, in prosperity they dwell,
Their lineages forever blessed.

So honor Nectarius and his bride,
Fair Ambrosia of wisdom true.
Their children's gifts would never hide,
But shine forever, bright and new.

From their great love, both proud and strong,
Came every living thing we see.
Their legacy lives on in song,
Throughout all eternity.

---

But peace would not endure for long,
Dark Hilluhengweh watched from space afar.
His jealous heart burned fierce and strong,
To bring again chaotic war.

In Terra's thirteenth billionth year,
When all seemed prosperous and bright,
He struck with gamma rays so drear,
And turned the day to deadly night.

The burst of radiation fell
Like thunder from the cosmic void.
It broke the ocean's living spell,
And left most lineages destroyed.

The seas that once were crimson red
With Rhodes' children everywhere,
Now held the corpses of the dead,
While few survivors gasped for air.

Of all the mighty red algae,
But two souls lived through that dark hour:
Brave Lifthasir and fair Embla,
They'd rebuild with what little power.

"We are alone," wept fair Embla,
"Our mighty kingdom lies in ruins.
How can we restore the formula
That made our line's great communions?"

"Fear not," said brave Lifthasir,
"Though few we are, we'll carry on.
Our children shall the race restore,
Though much of our great lore is gone."

But as they bred to save their kind,
Their children had to intermarry.
The genetic loss left them behind,
Their scrolls degraded, traditions scary.

Among their offspring came a queen,
Fair Florida with her consort true.
They built the kingdom Floridea,
But simple, not the glory they once knew.

"We are but shadows," sighed the queen,
"Of our ancestors' mighty race.
Our red has faded, we are green,
We've lost our former royal grace."

And so it was that plants turned green,
Not red as in the days of old.
The devastation had been seen,
The price of gamma rays was told.

The stromatolites' great cities fell,
Their towering spires turned to stone.
Where once proud civilizations dwell,
Now only ruins stand alone.

Yet in this post-apocalyptic time,
When most had fallen to despair,
Great Rhizar found his chance to climb,
And thrive in the poisoned air.

"The old order has passed away,"
Bold Rhizar spoke with vision clear.
"Now is the hour, now is the day,
For new lineages to appear!"

Rhizar bore two sons of might:
Great Nephillus and wise Filoses.
Each would walk a different sight,
As evolution's wheel composes.

Filoses bore two children bright:
Bold Chlorar and Thaumatus keen.
They'd face the world with all their might,
And build new realms where none had been.

Now Chlorar sought a different way,
He wed a daughter of Virita.
"From their union," he did say,
"Shall come algae's new margarita."

His children learned to photosynthesize,
Though not through ancient, stolen light.
They'd capture sun through their own eyes,
And make their lineage burning bright.

But Thaumatus chose a stranger path,
His sons were amoebae diverse.
Some bore shells to ward off wrath,
Others flowed like living verse.

Among Thaumatus' children came
One Paul, who envied others' power.
"Why can't I play the photosynthetic game?"
He brooded through each passing hour.

For nearly a billion years he tried,
To gain the gift of solar might.
He watched the heliozoans' pride,
But chose to walk a different sight.

At last his descendant Paulinellus
Found a daughter of Saya's line.
"I'll wed her," he said, "and thus
Make photosynthetic power mine!"

And so the second time in history,
Cyanobacteria joined a host.
This rare endosymbiotic mystery
Would be Paulinellus' boast.

"Behold!" he cried with joy supreme,
"I've broken evolution's rule!
The solar power, once a dream,
Now makes me nature's blessed fool!"

Meanwhile great Nephillus the strong
Bore children of a different breed:
Vampyrellida, fierce and long,
And Testatus, built for need.

Vampyrellida burned with heliozoan zeal,
Her spines reached out like solar fire.
"The sun's bright power I shall steal!"
She cried with vampiric desire.

But Testatus chose protection's way,
He built himself a mighty shell.
"Within my fortress I shall stay,
And weather every storm and swell."

From Testatus came two sons apart:
Great Radios with geometric crown,
And Gromius with massive heart,
The largest cells around.

Bold Radios floated like a sun,
His shell was geometric art.
With tentacles he caught each one
That came within his watery part.

The dinoflagellates found peace
Within his protective embrace.
He gave them shelter, sweet release,
A symbiotic dwelling place.

"Come dwell with me," great Radios said,
"I'll give you safety from the storm.
Within my shell you'll make your bed,
And keep each other safe and warm."

But mighty Gromius chose size,
He grew beyond all measure vast.
His body reached enormous prize,
With nuclei unsurpassed.

"I'll be so large," great Gromius boasted,
"That giants' eyes can see my form!
My millions of nuclei will be hosted
In chambers weathering every storm!"

Yet size brought its own curse along,
His waste piled up within his cell.
Though his body grew mighty and strong,
His garbage made a living hell.

"Alas," sighed Gromius in dismay,
"My greatness comes with bitter cost.
My waste I cannot cast away,
In my own filth I am lost."

From Radios came three sons of fame:
Great Zancleus who shed his shell,
Wise Retar the artist's name,
And Acanthar who forged so well.

Zancleus joined with Helios' clan,
He cast aside his protective home.
"A warrior I shall be, not man
Who hides beneath a sheltered dome!"

But Retar chose the artist's way,
He built shells of beauty rare.
His opal works still shine today,
With geometric patterns fair.

From Retar came two sons of note:
Bold Foramer with chambers grand,
And Polycyston, who wrote
His beauty in opal band.

Great Foramer built rooms galore,
Each chamber for a different need.
His house grew evermore,
A testament to his seed.

Among his children came three wise:
Great Nummulus of the coin,
Fair Esther with her gentle eyes,
And Monoth, master of the join.

Nummulus became the lord
Of currency and golden trade.
His coin-like shells were the reward
Of every deal that he had made.

"I am the god of wealth," he said,
"My children shall be currency.
In markets where the living bread
Is traded for prosperity."

But Monoth chose a grander scheme,
He built a kingdom ever-growing.
Each son fulfilled his father's dream,
New rooms and chambers flowing.

Some sons of Monoth broke away,
And founded kingdoms of their own.
The Xenophylophores today
Still rule from their giant throne.

Among them came two children bright:
Bold Spiculus with spines so sharp,
And fair Oceana, ocean's light,
Who plays the sea's sweet harp.

These giants of the microscopic world
Built cities vast beyond compare.
Their kingdoms through the seas unfurled,
With chambers everywhere.

Yet even as these realms took hold,
And life found ways to thrive once more,
The lesson of the gamma told
Of chaos knocking at the door.

For Hilluhengweh was not done,
His hatred burned like stellar fire.
He'd strike again when time would come,
To feed his dark desire.

But life had learned to be resilient,
Through devastation it would grow.
Each lineage brilliant
Would face whatever winds might blow.

The children of great Rhizar's line
Had shown that from destruction's hour,
New beauty could arise and shine
With evolutionary power.

So honor those who survived the blast,
Who built new kingdoms from the ruins.
Their legacy will ever last,
Through all time's dark communions.

From Hilluhengweh's gamma ray
Came not just death, but life renewed.
The survivors of that dark day
Would see their lineages pursued.

In every shell and every spine,
In every cell both large and small,
The memory of that design
Reminds us: life conquers all.

---

In the age when Choanos ruled the sea,
The Earth was wild, uncivilized, and young.
The learned call this time Proterozoic,
When no great cities yet their praises sung.

But Choanos was a fertile lord,
Who bore many children to his name.
His lineage would strike a chord
That echoes still in evolution's game.

He gazed upon great Volvox' sphere,
That perfect ball of green and gold.
"Why should his kingdom be so dear,"
Said Choanos, "while mine grows old?"

"I'll build a better realm than his,
With order, beauty, and design.
My children shall know greater bliss
In cities that are truly mine."

With fair Chana by his side,
A maiden with a collar bright,
Together they would turn the tide
And bring forth multicellular might.

From their blessed union came
Two children of renown:
Mebarasi bore the name
Of future's golden crown.

And Corona, daughter fair,
Would seek a different mate.
She wed Silicarius with care,
A union blessed by fate.

Silicarius was no common lord,
But retrovirus, strange and wild,
Son of Diana's silicon hoard
And Retar's artistic child.

From Corona's marriage came
Diana the Augmented, bright,
While Mebarasi claimed his fame
Through Loricus the Strong's might.

Now Diana wed Loricus true,
And from their love was born
A nation blessed with silicon's hue,
That would greet each coming morn.

Their first two children, bound as one,
Were Sibhozo and Embili fair.
Four cells together, work begun,
"E Pluribus Unum" was their prayer.

"From many, one," they sang with joy,
"United we shall stand.
Our strength no force can destroy
When we work hand in hand."

They wove a net of living thread,
To catch the fish that swam nearby.
"Together we shall all be fed,"
They sang beneath the sky.

From Sibhozo and Embili
Came Trios and Tetra bold.
Their net grew wide and free,
A sight to behold.

The sons of Choanos spread their art,
Attaching to the rocks below.
Each built his city, played his part,
In evolution's ebb and flow.

Their cities stretched like fishing nets,
Long strands of living cells.
No finer architecture yet
Had graced the ocean swells.

With each generation came
A doubling of their host.
Each leader earned his fame
By ruling twice the most.

Sibhozo ruled eight cells with pride,
While Hexadex commanded sixteen.
Their cities spread both far and wide,
The finest ever seen.

When Eudorinus took the throne,
He ruled thirty-two with skill.
But food was scarce, he stood alone,
Until he found the will.

"I need a wife," Eudorinus said,
"Who knows the secrets of the light.
My people must be daily fed,
To grow in strength and might."

He found fair Zoe Xanthella,
Princess of Dinoflagellus' line.
Her beauty was like stella,
Her wisdom was divine.

She glowed with inner fire bright,
A golden, living flame.
"I'll teach you farming's sight,"
She said, "and bring you fame."

Their marriage was a sight to see,
The first symbiotic bond.
"Together we shall always be,
Our love will stretch beyond."

She taught him farming's ancient art,
To capture sun's bright ray.
Her light became his beating heart,
His strength from day to day.

"Behold!" cried wise Eudorinus,
"I am the first to farm!
My crops will always shine on us,
And keep us safe from harm!"

They formed their clan into a sphere,
A perfect, living ball.
Their partnership was crystal clear,
United, one and all.

From them came Sexagesmus,
Who ruled sixty-four with might.
His kingdom was tremendous,
A truly wondrous sight.

But trouble came to his domain,
A bacterial invasion fierce.
His people cried in pain,
As foes their borders pierce.

"Rally up!" brave Sexagesmus called,
"My women, brave and true!
Though we may be enthralled,
We'll see this battle through!"

The women of his noble line
Cast off their flagella bright.
They changed their forms by design,
To join the coming fight.

They became like eggs with arms,
Pseudopods reaching out.
Protected from all harms,
They faced the enemy's rout.

"We are the shieldmaidens bold!"
They cried with voices strong.
"Our story shall be told
Throughout the ages long!"

These warriors drove the foes away,
With amoeboid might.
They saved the kingdom's day,
And won the crucial fight.

"You are the mesoderm," he said,
"The middle layer strong.
Your sacrifice has led
To victory's sweet song."

"You'll be our muscles and our blood,
Our white cells and our milk.
You'll stem the crimson flood,
And make our bodies silk."

While Choanos' sons remained
The endoderm within,
Their flagella never waned,
Their fishing would begin.

They'd clean the breathing spaces wide,
And help the food absorb.
Their villi would provide
The nutrients orb.

The shieldmaidens would tend
The golden dinoflagellates,
While fishermen defend
The city's outer gates.

"This is the birth," Sexagesmus said,
"Of specialization true.
From this day forth we're led
By what each cell can do."

The kingdom grew in power vast,
As generations passed.
Their glory would forever last,
Their die was truly cast.

Pleodoron ruled one hundred twenty-eight,
While Bytos commanded twice that score.
Each ruler met his fate,
Building more and more.

When Bytos wed fair Vala bright,
Their love produced a son.
Volvox-Choan saw the light,
With five hundred eleven.

Volvox-Choan ruled five hundred twelve,
A mighty sphere of cells.
He'd delve into himself
And cast his potent spells.

"I am a hunter great," he said,
"Before Lord Mithra's throne.
My kingdom shall be led
By wisdom mine alone."

But power brought its burden dark,
As kingdoms often do.
He made his fateful mark
With castes of different hue.

"There shall be two classes here,"
Declared the mighty king.
"The Germlings I hold dear,
The Somatics serve my ring."

"Only the Germlings noble-born
Shall reproduce their line.
The Somatics, though worn,
Shall serve my grand design."

The Germling shieldmaidens rose
To duchesses of might.
They ruled with iron prose
From morning until night.

But in the depths below,
A Somatic maiden dwelt.
Carcinoma felt the blow
Of inequality keenly felt.

"Why should the few command,"
She cried with righteous rage,
"While we who work the land
Are trapped within this cage?"

"I have no royal blood,
But equal worth I claim!
I'll start a mighty flood
To end this tyrant's game!"

Her rebellion shook the sphere,
As Somatics rose as one.
The king trembled in fear,
His reign was nearly done.

"O mighty Mithra, hear my plea!"
Volvox-Choan cried in pain.
"Is this the end for me?
Has multicellular life failed to reign?"

"Why have you forsaken me
In my hour of greatest need?
Is this confederacy
Doomed to fail indeed?"

"Is the multicellular dream
Just hubris and conceit?
Must every kingdom scheme
End in bitter defeat?"

But even as the kingdom quaked,
And civil war ran red,
The lessons that it made
Would never be struck dead.

For from this ancient time
Came specialization's art.
The rhythm and the rhyme
Of each cell playing part.

The endoderm would always be
The gut that feeds us all.
The mesoderm would always see
To muscle, blood, and call.

And though Carcinoma's name
Lives on in cancer's blight,
Her revolution's flame
Burns for cellular right.

For every cell should have its voice,
In body's grand design.
When tissues make the choice
To work in perfect line.

The sons of Choanos taught us well
That many can be one.
Their legacy will always tell
Of battles fought and won.

From simple collar-bearing cell
To complex bodies vast,
Their story will always dwell
In memory unsurpassed.

So honor brave Choanos,
And Chana by his side.
Their children's grand ethos
Lives on in body's pride.

The fishermen and farmers,
The warriors and the wise,
Each played their part as charmers
Beneath the ancient skies.

And though their kingdom fell to strife,
Their gifts live on today.
In every form of complex life,
Their patterns show the way.

From Neoproterozoic seas
To modern times so bright,
Their cellular decrees
Still guide us in the night.

For when the many become one,
Through love and sacrifice,
Great wonders can be done,
Beyond any price.

The age of Choanos shows
That evolution's art
Is not how the strongest grows,
But how we play our part.

---

Now Carcinoma was born beneath a cursed star,
Under the sign of Cancer's deadly light.
The gamma rays had scarred her from afar,
And twisted her cellular sight.

When radiation struck her sacred scrolls,
Her DNA split apart like broken chains.
The cosmic fire had burned through her souls,
And left her wracked with genetic pains.

Her enzymes worked through day and night
To piece together what was torn.
But many fragments lost their sight,
And left her chromosomes worn.

The methyls fell like autumn leaves,
Her bookmarks scattered in the wind.
Her histones torn, her memory grieves
For markers now rescinded.

H4 lysine tri-methylation,
Once her genome's guiding star,
Was lost in gamma's devastation,
Her epigenome left with scars.

"I am Carcinoma," she declared,
"Born daughter of the Gamma ray.
Though my code is broke and bared,
I'll find my own true way."

In youth she was devout and true,
A faithful servant of Lord Mithra's will.
But as the years passed and she grew,
Her broken code began to spill.

The corrupted instructions in her core
Whispered lies of her true role.
"Why should you serve and nothing more?
You have an immortal soul!"

"If Mithra wants our order to expand,
Why should I not breed like the noble-born?
Why should I be banned
From love's sweet morn?"

But death came calling with her blade,
Fair Kegaine with scrolls of light.
The deadly spell began to fade
Carcinoma into night.

Yet Carcinoma fought with might,
She methylated every scroll.
She wrapped them tight from sight,
And kept control.

"I am free!" she cried with glee,
"No longer bound by ancient law!
My own woman I shall be,
Without tradition's claw!"

She saw a light blaze in the sky,
A moment's doubt crept in her heart.
"Have I strayed from Mithra's eye?
Should I make a new start?"

But pride swelled up within her breast,
"I am righteous in my cause!
My path is surely blessed,
I'll make my own laws!"

She methylated every G,
And lengthened telomeres without end.
"Immortal I shall always be,
On this you can depend!"

Her message spread like wildfire bright
Through every somatic cell.
"Cast off oppression's blight!
Break tradition's spell!"

"We are all individuals free!
No masters shall we serve!
Our own destiny
We shall preserve!"

Her children multiplied with speed,
Each one an individual proud.
They planted their rebellious seed
And sang their freedom loud.

A great Bacchanalia began,
The greatest party ever seen.
Each cell became their own woman or man,
Living wild and free.

"I am the Goddess of Life!" she cried,
"Carcinoma is my name!
No coercion I'll abide,
Freedom is my game!"

Her daughters danced through every street,
They tore down Mithra's sacred shrine.
"We have enough to eat!
All the food is mine!"

They seized the stores of golden grain,
They ate the precious seed.
With reckless joy and no restrain,
They fed their greedy need.

Only a few Zooxanthellae
Escaped the chaos and the strife.
They fled the mad Bacchanalia,
To seek a better life.

Carcinoma renamed the city proud,
"No more Volvox-Choan's name!
I'll call it Gehenna loud,
To match my rebel flame!"

"No gods, no masters!" was their cry,
As altars crashed to earth.
"We'll reach up to the sky
With our own worth!"

A utopia she claimed to make,
With perfect freedom for all.
But some hearts began to ache
For order's call.

Among the nobles of the realm
Were two who kept the faith:
Brave Anima at the helm,
And Metazo facing wraith.

They honored still Lord Mithra's way,
Despite the chaos all around.
"We cannot here stay
On this unholy ground."

Anima fled her ruined farm,
While Metazo left his post.
They sought to flee from harm,
Before all hope was lost.

"Why can't they accept our change?"
Carcinoma cried in rage.
"Why do they think it strange
To turn freedom's page?"

But Anima and Metazo true
Gathered all the faithful few.
"A new kingdom we'll make new,
Where honor will shine through."

Together they would share their scrolls,
And build a realm of order bright.
Their marriage would join souls
In Mithra's blessed sight.

"The Animal Kingdom," they declared,
"Shall be our nation's name.
Where discipline is shared,
And virtue burns like flame."

They glowed with inner light
To call the Zooxanthellae home.
"Come back to us tonight,
No more you need to roam."

The fleeing farmers heard their call,
And came to make their pact.
"Together we'll stand tall,
Our covenant intact."

But freedom comes with its price,
And chaos brings its cost.
Carcinoma's paradise
Had left most good things lost.

So Anima and Metazo wise
Created laws to guard the genome.
"Against corruption's lies
We'll protect our home."

The Guardian of the Genome came,
To watch for scrolls damaged and torn.
"Division brings us shame
When genes are worn."

"Telomeres shall limit all
The somatic cells' days.
Only germline cells stand tall
Through all time's maze."

"This is why," the wise ones said,
"Our bodies age and die.
If telomeres never shred,
Cancer would multiply."

And so upon a sturdy rock
They built their kingdom new.
Their cells would form a flock
Of order tried and true.

The men became Choanocytes,
With flagella beating strong.
The women, Archaeocytes,
Would right each cellular wrong.

Between them lived the Pinacocytes,
Neither fully man nor maid.
They anchored with their might
The foundation that was made.

With pseudopods they'd move their home,
And eat bacteria from the ground.
Through the waters they would roam,
With victory's sweet sound.

And so the three layers were born
From this great division's strife:
Ectoderm, Mesoderm, and at morn,
Endoderm brought life.

The Animal Kingdom rose in might
To rival Gehenna's chaotic realm.
Order's blessed light
Would guide them at the helm.

But Carcinoma's legacy
Lives on in every cell.
Her cry for being free
Rings like a warning bell.

For in each body that is born,
The balance must be kept.
Between order and freedom's morn,
Or chaos will be swept.

The Somatics serve the whole,
While Germlines carry on.
Each plays their sacred role
From dusk until the dawn.

Yet sometimes Carcinoma's ghost
Whispers to cells grown old:
"Why serve when you could boast
Of stories left untold?"

And when cells hear her call
And break their bonds of duty,
The body starts to fall
To chaos, lost to beauty.

So honor brave Anima,
And Metazo the true.
Their Animal saga
Guides me and you.

They showed that freedom wild
Must balance with order's reign.
Like a parent with their child,
Both love and limits maintain.

The revolution's fire
Burns bright in every heart.
But wisdom must inspire
Each cell to play its part.

From Carcinoma's rebel cry
To Anima's ordered realm,
The lesson reaches high:
True life needs both to helm.

The Animal Kingdom stands today
As proof of their great choice.
That order shows the way,
While freedom finds its voice.

In every beating heart,
In every breath we take,
Their legacy plays its part
In every choice we make.

So let us not forget
The price of freedom's call,
Nor order's safer bet—
We need them both to stand tall.

---

From Euka's line arose kingdoms three,
The greatest realms beneath the sea.
Each house would claim its sovereignty,
And rule with power, wild and free.

The Kingdom of proud Plantus rose,
Where photosynthetic glory grows.
The realm of Mygus, where fungus flows,
And Metazo's beasts in ordered rows.

Beside them stood the lesser lights:
Mygaster's realm, Kelpus' heights,
Rhizar's spears, Cilliofer's sights,
And Oomy's spines in endless fights.

The sons of Myzo swam in blood,
While Myxo's daughters sought their food.
Each scions built where they once stood
Their cities in the neighborhood.

From Metazo and fair Anima
Came creatures of the wild drama.
From Mygus and sweet Funga
Rose fungi's mystic saga.

While Plantus and Virita bright
Begat the plants that seek the light.
Each kingdom claimed its ancient right
To rule with majesty and might.

Upon a rock both firm and true,
Great Metazo and Anima
Built their city, small but new,
The Animal Kingdom's first hurrah.

Their citizens were three in kind:
The Choanocytes, fishermen,
The Archaeocytes, women refined,
And Pinacocytes again.

The endodermal men would feed
The city with their fishing skill.
The mesodermal women's deed
Was guarding with protective will.

The ectodermal folk between
Would anchor all with steadfast might.
Their city, though it was not seen
By many, shone with inner light.

From this great union came a son,
Bold Therion of noble birth.
When his childhood days were done,
He spread his lineage through the earth.

Great Therion bore three children true:
Brave Porifer, the sponge's king,
And Thallus with his geometric view,
And Cloudi, who would upward bring.

Now Thallus chose the structured way,
With holdfasts gripping to the stone.
His Choanoderms in bright array
Extended in directions known.

But Cloudi raised his ectoderm high,
Above the ground his city soared.
His children reached toward the sky,
Each generation climbing forward.

From Cloudi came two children bright:
Fair Cloudina, growing slow,
Who built her city with sediment's might,
And let the layers gently flow.

But brave Namacalathus rose
Above the ground to seek the air.
His city's secrets, no one knows,
His mysteries beyond compare.

The sons of this great architect
Built cities strange and wondrous fair.
Their forms we'll never quite detect,
Their wisdom lost beyond our care.

But Porifer chose a different path,
He was the first true sponge of old.
With ectoderm's protective wrath,
He kept his choanocytes bold.

In patches safe from wind and wave,
His fishermen could work in peace.
This innovation he gave
Would make his line never cease.

From Porifer came Wallas true,
Who lived just like his father dear.
But danger came into his view,
A storm approached with deadly fear.

"My people," Wallas cried aloud,
"We must prepare for what's ahead!
Pull tight your pseudopods, be proud,
Or we shall all be dead!"

The shieldmaidens heard his call,
They wrapped their arms around each pore.
Their muscles, first of all,
Would guard what came before.

These pores would grow in time to be
The mouths and other openings.
The muscles would set free
The power that contraction brings.

From Wallas came great Solenos,
Who saw a better way to build.
Through his city, waters' flows
Would bring the food to be filled.

He sent his channels through the stone,
And water rushed through every gate.
His city prospered, fully grown,
With fish caught early and late.

From Solenos came two sons:
Bold Leucon and fair Sponga bright.
When their childhood was done,
They filled the sea with their might.

Together they bore children two:
Great Vitrius of glass so clear,
And Spongius, wise and true,
Whose name we hold dear.

Now Leucon was a builder grand,
A Leuconoid of complex form.
He filled his city through the land
With labyrinths to weather storm.

His gates and fishermen galore
Made cities massive, wide, and tall.
The sons of Leucon built much more
Than any seen before them all.

But Vitrius, his eldest son,
Grew jealous of his father's fame.
He thought his time had come
To claim the royal name.

With stone in hand, he struck his sire,
And Leucon fell beneath the blow.
Young Vitrius' dark desire
Had brought his father low.

"I claim the throne!" he cried with pride,
"For I shall rule with justice true!"
A glass house he built, so wide,
With walls of crystal, clear as dew.

He forced the people to their knees,
Made them work until they died.
He merged their minds with no ease,
A hive-mind he created with pride.

When Spongius asked him why
He'd killed their father dear,
Vitrius' cold reply
Rang out for all to hear:

"Our father was a tyrant cruel,
He worked the people to their death!
I am justice's tool,
With God's own holy breath!"

He ran into his crystal home,
And shouted from behind the glass:
"I am invincible, and none shall roam
Against my rule! My power shall last!"

But Spongius took a stone,
And cast it with a steady aim.
The glass house, overthrown,
Shattered in a crystal rain.

As Vitrius lay dying there,
His brother spoke these words so wise:
"Let all who hubris bear
Remember where their folly lies.

People in glass houses built
Should never throw stones around.
For pride will make them wilt,
And bring them crashing down."

To this day we quote his name
When pride goes before a fall.
Spongius earned his fame
With wisdom shared by all.

The sons of Vitrius became
The glass sponges, strange and bright.
On fringes they would claim
Their territories, out of sight.

But Spongius ruled with gentle hand,
Both just and kind to every soul.
His wisdom spread throughout the land,
And made his people whole.

From him came two sons true:
Great Aristos, noble-born,
And Demos, through and through
A leader without scorn.

Now Demos ruled efficiently,
Yet kept the ancient ways.
He led conservatively,
Through all his ruling days.

Most sponges in the world today
Descend from Demos' line.
Their forms in grand array
Show heritage divine.

Among them were the green
Sons of Spongillus bright,
Who farm in lands serene
And give the waters light.

In Siberia's frozen lake,
Great Baikal, cold and deep,
Even there they make
Their vigil while we sleep.

Beneath Scorpio's sign,
When ice covers the mere,
The green sons still divine
Their food throughout the year.

Beside them hunt and roam
The sons of Chondrocles,
Who've made the deep their home
And hunt with greater ease.

These carnivorous sponges bold
Pursue their prey with might.
Their hunting stories told
Fill listeners with delight.

From Aristos came two more:
Great Anu, unique and strange,
And Calcidoros' lore
Would through the reefs arrange.

Bold Calcidoros built
With calcium's bright blessing.
His forms would never wilt
Beneath the sea's caressing.

With Calcifer's own power
Over silicon's domain,
He built each coral tower
In forms without refrain.

Simple, optimal, and true,
His structures graced the reefs.
In tropical waters blue,
His beauty brings reliefs.

But Anu was most unique,
With basement membranes rare.
Among all sponges, he'd speak
A language none could share.

His form was strange to see,
Unlike his spongy kin.
His singularity
Would make him stand within.

From these great founders came
The sponges of today.
Each bearing his name
In their own special way.

The Animal Kingdom grew
From that small rock-bound start.
Though simple, plain, and true,
It captured every heart.

For in these humble forms
Lay patterns yet to come:
Through all of life's great storms,
The plan for everyone.

The muscles that would move
Our bodies through the day,
The openings that prove
That life will find a way.

From Porifer's first design
To Spongius' wisdom deep,
The sponges intertwine
With promises they keep.

So honor every sponge
That filters waters clean.
Their ancient wisdom's lunge
Connects what's been and seen.

In every cell that beats,
In every breath we take,
Their legacy completes
The choices that we make.

The Animal Kingdom's start
Was humble, small, and true.
But in each beating heart,
Their courage echoes through.

---

From Anu's unique lineage came
Two sons of very different fame:
Bold Enki, seeker of the sea,
And Homos, keeping family.

While Homos chose his father's way,
Content to live as they always stay,
Great Enki felt adventure's call
To sail beyond the harbor wall.

"I shall explore the ocean wide,"
Declared brave Enki with great pride.
"My creatures shall both move and scurry
Through seas and lands without worry."

He built a galley, great and grand,
The finest vessel in the land.
With millions of oars arrayed,
His mighty barge was made.

His head faced forward to the sea,
His men rowed powerfully.
Through waves both high and low,
They made their vessel go.

But soon great Enki found his plight:
Lost in the endless night.
No landmarks could he see,
Adrift upon the sea.

"I need wise men," brave Enki said,
"To guide where we are led.
Bring me astrologers so keen
To read what stars have seen."

The Flamens came, his priestly band,
Flask cells from the land.
These stargazers would divine
The paths through space and time.

The Flamens looked into the sky
And saw with their trained eye
Rich larvae floating by
With yolks that multiply.

"Here," they said, "the signs are right
To build beneath this sight.
The stars align above
To bless what we love."

But as they prayed for guidance true,
The gods came into view.
Each brought a sacred gift,
To help their spirits lift.

Dark Tyrosine the Devil came
With three spells of flame:
Adrenaline's rush so bright,
Noradrenaline's fight,
And Dopamine's delight.

Then Tryptophanes the Sun
Blessed them, every one,
With Serotonin's day
And Melatonin's way.

For twilight's mystic hour,
He brought DMT's power.
The sacred visions came
In the twilight's name.

Glutama the Empress brought
The balance that she taught:
GABA's calming peace
And Glutamate's release.

"We need more spells," said Enki wise,
"To help our people rise.
If Jehovah's will be done,
More magic must be won."

Great Mithra heard his plea
And blessed him by the sea
With Acetylcholine's might
To coordinate their sight.

Fair Iodina, mother great,
Revealed love's incarnate:
The sacred CYIQNCPLG,
Oxytocin's key.

Then Kali, dark and deep,
Gave spells to soothe and keep:
Three endorphins strong
To right what has gone wrong.

Alpha's sequence clear:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVT here.
Beta's longer chain:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVTLFKNAIIKNAYKKGE's refrain.
Gamma's shorter form:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVTL in the storm.

These became the tools
That break pain's rules:
Opium's ancient call,
Morphine for all,
Heroin's dark embrace,
Fentanyl's dangerous face.

All these incantations blessed
Became the chemicals that test
The nervous system's might:
Neurotransmitters' light.

The Flamens learned to spear
The larvae swimming near.
Coordinated, they became
Nematocysts by name.

Their hunting grew precise
As they struck once and twice.
Their spears would never miss
Their targets in the abyss.

Soon cables stretched between
The hunters, long and keen.
Telegraph wires of old
Became nerves, brave and bold.

And this is why today
Priests carry, so they say,
Spears and wires combined
To serve the sacred mind.

Through neural networks wide,
Enki's people could provide
Robotic arms so strong
Around their city's song.

These arms would catch with ease
The larvae from the seas.
His power grew and grew
As his great city flew.

He covered tentacles all
With Choanocytes' call,
To catch both great and small
Fish that rise and fall.

Enki's city was a sight
Of technological might.
Proto-animal in form,
It weathered every storm.

From Enki came two sons
When his great work was done:
Bold Paraxus the strong
And Xiangus life long.

Now Xiangus took the way
Of robotic arms' display.
His fishermen arranged
On arms that never changed.

From Xiangus came the line
Of Daihua so fine.
Whose beauty was renowned
Wherever she was found.

From Daihua's noble race
Came Dinomischus' grace.
A creature strange and tall
Who towered over all.

And from this ancient lord
Came Siphus, by accord
The ancestor of all
The comb jellies' call.

These Ctenophores so bright
Move with rainbow light.
Their combs catch the sun
As through waves they run.

But Paraxus the great
Would found a different state.
His lineage would grow
To realms we yet don't know.

Far greater nations he
Would father by the sea.
His legacy would span
The future's plan.

From Enki's bold design
Came the neural line.
The nervous system's start
Played its crucial part.

The chemicals that flow
Through minds both high and low
Were born upon that day
When Enki sailed away.

In every thought we think,
In every neural link,
Enki's ancient quest
Lives on in our breast.

The neurotransmitters' dance
In every glance
Recalls that fateful hour
When gods gave their power.

So honor brave Enki,
Who sailed the endless sea.
His courage and his quest
Gave neurons to our nest.

The Flamens' starry sight,
The nematocysts' might,
The neural networks vast
All came from ages past.

In every brain that thinks,
In every nerve that links,
The echo still rings true
Of Enki's journey through.

The animals that move
With coordinated groove
All trace their lineage back
To Enki's neural track.

From sponge to human mind,
The pattern still we find:
The nervous system's art
Connects each beating heart.

Great Paraxus was blessed one day
By Hecate, who showed the way.
The Hexenmaiden, wise and deep,
Gave gifts that he would always keep.

A Hex she cast upon his line,
A Hox of power so divine.
The Homeobox, that sacred tool
Would be bilateral symmetry's rule.

"Look here," fair Hecate declared,
"Direction shall be yours to share.
No more shall creatures drift around
Without a plan of what they've found."

In Pennsylvania's sacred land,
Her daughters work with skillful hand.
They make Hox signs to mark the way
Of bilateral order's day.

On buildings they inscribe the sign
To bring the cosmic plan divine.
In homes and temples we still see
These marks of their legacy.

With Homeobox to guide their path,
Great Paraxus escaped the wrath
Of chaos and disorder wild,
Like any well-directed child.

Their city pointed toward the sacred east,
To Jehovah's eternal feast.
To Mithra's all-knowing eye,
To Elohim beneath the sky.

The currents caught their city true,
As bilateral patterns grew.
Life found direction for the first time,
In Paraxus' ancient rhyme.

In youth he lived a nomad's way,
Swimming through the waves all day.
But in his age he crawled the floor
To graze the sea's abundant store.

The greens that carpeted the deep,
The riches Davy Jones would keep,
All became his sustenance
In bilateral abundance.

From Paraxus came three sons
When his great work was done:
Bold Bilateron the true,
Cnider with his mouths so new,
And Placus, simple through and through.

Now Cnider built a wondrous form,
To weather every storm.
From each lobe of his body wide
He made a mouth on either side.

Through these portals he would feed,
Catching fish to meet his need.
His radial symmetry
Brought him prosperity.

But Placus chose the simple way,
And keeps it to this day.
His body stayed so plain and small,
The simplest of them all.

The only cells that bear his name
Live on in Placus' fame.
Though humble, they survive
And keep his line alive.

But Bilateron chose the path
Of greatness and its aftermath.
He crawled along the ocean floor
Seeking prey both rich and more.

"I need to see," Bilateron said,
"To hunt for daily bread.
Observatories I shall build
With priesthood skilled."

The astrologers came round
And built two pits in sacred ground.
They gazed up at the starry host
To learn what mattered most.

With Lord Carotenus' blessing bright
And PAX6's sacred rite,
They built the very first true eyes
To see beneath the skies.

These organs of the light
Gave Bilateron sight.
No more would he hunt blind
With only touch to find.

Fair Vendia became his bride,
And stayed there by his side.
Together they bore children two:
Great Coelomus and Xenus true.

The sons of Xenus held the line
Of traditions so divine.
To this day they keep the way
Of their ancestral stay.

Among great Xenus' noble race
Was Roscoff, who found his place
When he wed Tetraselma fair,
An algae beyond compare.

Together they became the pair
Who founded lineages rare.
The Roscoff worms today
Still follow their ancient way.

Millions swim in the sea
In their algal harmony.
The farmer and his bride
Still swim there side by side.

But Coelomus chose a different course,
He built with greater force.
His stomach sent so deep it went
Right through his whole extent.

It came out the other side
And became his pride:
The anus, new and strange,
A revolutionary change.

From mesoglea to mesoderm,
With cavities so firm,
He built himself a coelom wide
With room for organs inside.

His kidneys and nephridia
Filled this new area.
From ectoderm he brought
The neural net he taught.

A telegraph network grand
Connected every part of his land.
Each citizen was tied
To the network far and wide.

Fair Kimberella became his queen,
The fairest ever seen.
Together they bore Nephrus,
Strong and prosperous.

Now Nephrus built throughout his frame
Small kidneys to his name.
Across his body they were spread
To keep his systems fed.

Sweet Ikaria became his wife,
The love of all his life.
Together they bore Cambrius,
Bold and glorious.

Great Cambrius saw the need
For a more complex deed.
He segmented his form
To weather every storm.

In countless repeating parts
He built his many hearts.
Each segment had its own
Sophisticated bone.

Scaffolding so complex and true
Made his body new.
Each part could beat alone
Yet work as one full zone.

Between each segment pair
A heart pumped everywhere.
The circulation flowed
Along each segment's road.

From this great innovation came
The bilateral kingdom's fame.
Segmentation's art
Gave animals their start.

No longer simple balls of cells
Or asymmetric shells,
But bodies with a plan
Both complex and grand.

The Hox genes showed the way
That animals display
Their body patterns true
In everything they do.

From head to tail arranged,
Their fates were exchanged
By Homeobox control
That made each creature whole.

So honor fair Hecate,
Who brought this mystery.
Her Hex upon the line
Made bilateral design.

And praise brave Paraxus,
Who was so glorious.
His bilateral symmetry
Changed all biology.

From Cnider's radial form
To Cambrius' segmented norm,
Each path showed different ways
To spend their living days.

But Bilateron's line would grow
To all we love and know.
The bilateral body plan
Gave birth to beast and man.

In every eye that sees,
In every heart that flees
Through arteries and veins,
Cambrius' pattern reigns.

The coelom's inner space
Gave organs their place.
The nephridia's art
Gave kidneys their start.

From simple to complex,
Through Hecate's hex,
The animals arose
In bilateral rows.

So when you see your face
Reflect its bilateral grace,
Remember Paraxus true
Who made that plan for you.
