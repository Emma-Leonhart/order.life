{{c|Vater}} was the son so great
In the tenth generation's fate
Of {{c|Pteraspis}}, and he'd be
{{c|Ancestor}} of humanity

And myriad species more
From mountain peak to shore.
His innovation would
Change all for the good.

{{c|Vater}} built a channel
{{c|Grand}} beyond all span-el
{{c|Uniting}} liver bright
And pancreas in sight

Into his belly's space.
To this day we trace
This channel's honored name:
"{{c|Ampulla}} of {{c|Vater}}'s" fame.

Such an exalted father,
{{c|Father}} of more than other
{{c|Men}} could ever dream,
The {{c|Elohim}}'s esteem

Called him {{c|Abraham}}
{{c|According}} to their plan
For one whose progeny
Would fill eternity.

{{c|Vater}} bore two sons:
{{c|Arandus}} when begun
The day, and {{c|Hestracon}}
Whose work would carry on

The family's great name
Through evolutionary flame
That burns in every heart
That plays innovation's part.

{{c|Hestracon}} found his belly
{{c|Inadequate}}, not ready
For the work he knew
That he would have to do.

From mouth to anus all
The same, and he'd call
This simple with disdain—
Only his father's main

{{c|Ampulla}} in the middle
To solve digestion's riddle.
But this was not enough
For one so strong and tough

As {{c|Hestracon}}, who'd see
What greater good could be
If he would dare to build
What none before had willed.

{{c|Hestracon}} built with care
A chamber prepared
Before his father's gift
To give digestion lift.

He called it his stomach,
And this would come to stick
As the great divider
Between the provider

Of food from mouth above
And what intestines' love
Would process down below
To make the body grow.

Before the stomach laid
The esophagus, well-made
To carry food along
Its pathway, swift and strong.

After the stomach laid
The intestine, well-played
In its appointed role
To nourish the whole.

{{c|Hestracon}} begat two:
{{c|Astrops}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Eteros}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Eteros}} begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
{{c|Cyatha}}, cup-shield bright,
And {{c|Tsubasa}}'s sight

{{c|Wing}}-shielded, prepared
For all that he had dared
To face in his lifetime
Through reason and through rhyme.

{{c|Tsubasa}} begat two:
{{c|Thelos}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Cephalus}} the wise
With penetrating eyes.

{{c|Thelos}} broke his armor
Into scales—no former
{{c|Rigidity}} would bind
His innovative mind.

Into innumerable scales
His armor never fails
To give him flexibility
And great ability

To live within the reefs
Where none could find reliefs
From rigid armor's weight
That sealed their swimming fate.

Where none others could bend
{{c|Well}} enough to transcend
The coral's tight embrace,
{{c|Thelos}} found his place.

Neither sons of {{c|Arthropus}}
Nor sons of {{c|Molluscus}},
Nor sons of {{c|Chordatus}}
Could match his status

In the reef's tight spaces
Where his grace replaces
{{c|Rigidity}} with flow
That helps him grow

Into every niche
Where others couldn't reach
The food that he could take
For his own sake.

{{c|Cephalus}} bore wings bright
On each side in sight
Of his helmet's form,
Through calm and raging storm.

His head flew as he swam
{{c|According}} to his plan
For stability and grace
In every watery place.

His lateral line would keep
Him ahead, and never sleep
In vigilance for all
That might befall

His swimming through the sea.
{{c|Aware}} of all that he
Could sense around his form,
He weathered every storm.

{{c|Cephalus}} begat two:
{{c|Galeas}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Osteos}}, who'd see
What innovation's key

Could open in the world
Where possibilities unfurled
For those who dared to think
Beyond tradition's link.

{{c|Osteos}} was in plight—
His bones weren't right
For efficiency, he knew.
He had to make them new.

His bones were expensive,
{{c|Comprehensively}}
{{c|Wasting}} countless moles
Of calcium that rolls

Through phosphorus and more
{{c|Elements}} by the score
That could be better used
If they were not abused

In static, lifeless bone
That stood there all alone
Without a greater plan
For helping mortal man.

So he decided he
Would build more cleverly
His skeleton anew
With wisdom tried and true.

{{c|Osteos}} built with care
{{c|Blood}} channels everywhere
Inside his bones, making
{{c|Living}}, breathing, taking

{{c|Stores}} of minerals
That worked like generals
In abundance building up
From nature's flowing cup,

And in scarcity
He'd borrow, you see,
From what he'd stored before
Like treasure in his store.

And so he grew more strong
And prosperous life long
{{c|Than}} all his relatives
Who took what nature gives

But never learned to save
For what the future gave
Of challenges and need
When they would have to feed

From stores they'd built in plenty
When resources weren't scanty
But flowed like rivers wide
With bounty as their guide.

{{c|Osteos}} bore two sons:
{{c|Pituri}} when begun
The day, and {{c|Ostracos}}
Whose children, glorious,

Would multiply and spread
Until the world was fed
With countless forms of life
Through harmony, not strife.

{{c|Ostracos}} bore a host
Of sons from coast to coast:
A million who would spread
{{c|Wherever}} they were led

By life's eternal call
To multiply for all
Who'd come in times ahead
When they would have to fed

The world with their own forms
Through calm and raging storms
Of evolution's way
From night into the day.

{{c|Pituri}} grew a snout
{{c|Long}} beyond all doubt
The longest ever seen
In evolution's scene.

{{c|Pituri}} begat then
{{c|Beakon}} beyond all ken
In wisdom and in might
To see with clearer sight.

{{c|Pituri}}'s mouth was made
Of lips, but never strayed
Into the realm of jaws—
He followed simpler laws.

Could only close the space
But never could erase
His prey with biting might—
No jaw was in his sight.

But {{c|Beakon}} saw potential
In what was essential
About his father's snout
And figured it out.

And so {{c|Beakon}} moved
His gill arches and proved
That innovation's art
Could play a vital part.

Into his mouth he brought
The arches, and he fought
For food in a new way
That worked both night and day.

{{c|Beakon}}'s son named {{c|Gnathus}}
Saw potential, glorious,
And he with wife {{c|Pelaca}}
{{c|Hunted}} like none other.

They hunted trilobites
And brought them to their lights
Of innovation's flame
That burned in their name.

They didn't just catch prey
In the ancient way
But crushed them with their might
And brought them to the sight

Of their armored jaws
That followed nature's laws
But used them in new ways
{{c|Throughout}} their living days.

They sliced through every meal
With jaws of steel-hard feel
That brought life-giving food
In their hunting mood.

And so {{c|Jaws}} were born
On that fateful morn
When {{c|Gnathus}} and {{c|Pelaca}}
Showed what none could match-a:

The power to break through
What none before could do—
To crush and to consume
What others could assume

Was safe in armor's shell
From those who'd never tell
The secret of the jaw
That follows newer law.

The world would never be
The same for you and me
From that day forth when jaws
Became the newer laws

Of predatory might
That brought to sight
A revolution new
In what life could do.

From {{c|Vater}}'s ampulla
To {{c|Gnathus}}' formula
For crushing with his jaws
{{c|According}} to new laws,

The vertebrates show how
{{c|Innovation}}'s vow
To never be content
With what is merely sent

By fate, but always strive
To be more alive
And capable and strong
{{c|Throughout}} their whole life long

{{c|Journey}} through the sea
Of possibility
Where those who dare to grow
Will always come to know

{{c|New}} heights of what can be
For all eternity
When innovation's fire
{{c|Burns}} with true desire

To make the world more bright
With new forms that take flight
Beyond what was before
To open up the door

Of possibility
For all humanity
And every living thing
That answers life's ring.

From {{c|Hestracon}}'s stomach
To {{c|Osteos}}' pragmatic
{{c|Bones}} with channels through,
From scales that {{c|Thelos}} knew

Would give him flexibility
To {{c|Cephalus}}' ability
To fly through water's space
With stabilizing grace,

The vertebrates remind
Us that the searching mind
That breaks from what is known
Can reap what it has sown

In innovations new
That see old dreams through
To heights beyond all thought
That wisdom ever brought.

From simple mouth that closed
To jaw that none opposed
In crushing power's might,
The story shows the sight

Of how small changes grow
Into the flow
Of evolution's stream
Where nothing's what they seem

But everything can change
Beyond familiar range
If we but have the will
To climb each higher hill

Of possibility
Through all eternity
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you today.

The jaws that {{c|Gnathus}} made
Will never ever fade
From vertebrate design—
{{c|Protection}} so fine

Against the world's hard ways
{{c|Throughout}} our living days
When we must fight to eat
And make our lives complete.

From {{c|Vater}}'s family tree
To jaws that set us free
From limitations old
Of stories yet untold,

The vertebrates have shown
How far we've grown
From simple, humble start
To mastery of art

That lets us rule the sea
And land and be
The masters of our fate
Through innovations great

That never cease to grow
In all we'll ever know
Of what can be achieved
When dreams are believed

And turned to reality
Through wise ability
To see what others miss
And find in this

The power to transcend
All limits and extend
The boundaries of life
Through harmony, not strife.

The world that {{c|Gnathus}} bit
With jaws of steel and grit
{{c|Lives}} on in every tooth
That tells the truth

Of how innovation's way
Can change both night and day
Into something new
For me and you

Who dare to break the mold
Of stories never told
And write upon the page
Of evolution's age

{{c|New}} chapters yet unread
Where we are led
By wisdom's guiding light
To make the future bright

With possibilities
That nobody sees
But those who dare to dream
Of more than what they seem

And turn those dreams to life
Through joy and through strife
That marks the growing soul
Who plays the vital role

In evolution's plan
For every woman, man,
And every living thing
That answers hope's ring.

From {{c|Vater}}'s great design
To {{c|Gnathus}}' jaw so fine,
The story's clear to see:
{{c|Innovation}} sets us free.
