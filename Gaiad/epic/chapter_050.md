{{c|Silur}}, son of {{c|Chelicer}},
Saw the world in ruin's blur.
And in this devastation
Saw opportunity's creation.

{{c|Silur}} shouted out with might
To all sons in his sight
Of {{c|Animus}}, declaring
His vision, never caring

For those who'd gone before:
"I did not steal this lore
Of kingship from the crown.
I found it lying down

In gutter, and I picked
It up, my fate predicted
By sword that I had found.
But 'twas the people's sound

Of voices that placed it
On my head, perfect fit
For one who'd take the throne
And make it all his own."

And so began the era
Of {{c|Silurian}} chimera,
{{c|Rising}} from the ashes
Of {{c|Ordovician}}'s crashes.

{{c|Silur}} bore two sons:
{{c|Eurypter}} when begun
The day, and {{c|Chasmas}} strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Chasmas}} begat two more:
{{c|Belangkas}} to explore
And {{c|Xiphos}}, who would be
{{c|Living}} by the sea.

{{c|Xiphos}} became the sire
Of crabs whose desire
Was horseshoe-shaped design
{{c|Throughout}} the end of time.

{{c|Belangkas}} climbed up high
Onto the land to try
What none had done before:
To claim from shore to shore

The land from {{c|Hirnan}}'s hand
And make his own command
Of territories wide
Where he could reside.

Like {{c|Myriapus}} of old
He found his story told
In suffocation's pain
Upon the terrestrial plain.

But pierced wounds in his side
And was thus satisfied
With air that he could breathe
To give his lungs relief.

{{c|Belangkas}} begat two:
{{c|Soliber}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Opiliona}} fair
Who spread life everywhere.

{{c|Opiliona}} spread the moss
Across the world, no loss
{{c|Too}} great for her to bear
In her maternal care.

She grazed upon the green
And on what could be seen
Of daughters of {{c|Millipa}}
{{c|Throughout}} the earthly steppe-a.

{{c|Opiliona}} was a mother
Great, and like no other
{{c|Farmer}} with her legs
So long, and wisdom begs

Us to remember her
As one who would confer
Great blessings on the land
With her maternal hand.

{{c|Beautiful}} legs so long
Made her the subject of song:
"{{c|Granny}} {{c|Long}} {{c|Legs}}" they'd call
Her, beloved by all.

"{{c|Granny}} {{c|Harvest}}" too,
For all the work she'd do
To spread the green of life
Through joy and through strife.

And so in honor of
Her life and of her love,
We call her children still
"{{c|Daddy}} {{c|Long}} {{c|Legs}}" (though will

Seem strange to some that "{{c|Daddy}}"
{{c|Names}} descendants of a lady).
"{{c|Harvestmen}}" as well
Their story always tell.

{{c|Soliber}} begat two:
{{c|Pneumaran}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Kitzi}}, small but strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Pneumaran}} begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
{{c|Solaran}} of the sun
And {{c|Acares}}, begun

As dwarf among his kin,
But he would always win
A place in history
As ancestor, you see,

Of mites, the little ones
Who when their work is done
Live everywhere on land
Built by their tiny hand.

{{c|Acares}} bore two sons:
{{c|Sarco}} when day begun
And {{c|Trombo}}, who would be
{{c|Living}} peacefully

Or not, as fate would tell
His story oh so well
Of how some choose the light
While others choose the night.

The sons of {{c|Sarco}} clean
The world, and can be seen
As dust mites everywhere
Who take the greatest care

To keep the world swept clean
Of dust that might have been
A problem for us all
Who answer life's sweet call.

Among the sons of {{c|Trombo}}
Some live like peaceful combo
Of gentleness and grace
In their appointed place.

But others are the plague
That makes all good souls vague
With worry and with fear—
{{c|Parasites}} we hear

{{c|Stifle}} life with their ways
{{c|Throughout}} our living days,
{{c|Horrific}} in their greed
That plants destruction's seed.

Among the peaceful ones
Are {{c|Trombo}}'s gentle sons:
The red velvet mites
Who bring us pure delights.

From red velvet mites
We learn love's sacred rites:
A story of the heart
That plays the loving part

In nature's grand design
Where all true loves align
With beauty and with grace
In every living place.

{{c|Solaran}} begat two:
{{c|Solifugon}} so true
And {{c|Ricinulon}} the small
Who answered duty's call.

{{c|Solifugon}} became
The father of great fame
Of {{c|Wind}} {{c|Spiders}} who race
Across the earth's face.

{{c|Ricinulon}} became
The father of the name
Of {{c|Tick}} {{c|Spiders}} so small
Who answer hunting's call.

{{c|Kitzi}} begat two sons:
{{c|Byblos}} when day begun
And {{c|Paras}}, who would be
{{c|Small}} in his degree.

{{c|Byblos}} the {{c|Book}} {{c|Knight}}
{{c|Continues}} day and night
To this very day
To guard in his own way

The books that hold the lore
Of all who came before.
His sons, the {{c|Book}} {{c|Scorpions}},
Are knowledge's companions.

They defend with their might
The books both day and night
From those who would destroy
What brings the world such joy.

{{c|Paras}} begat two more:
{{c|Mesos}} to explore
And {{c|Holoxos}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Mesos}} was a hunter
{{c|Fierce}}, and he would shunt-er
Across the globe to find
{{c|Prey}} to feed his mind

And body's gluttony—
A small but mighty fee
He'd take from life around
{{c|Wherever}} he was found.

But {{c|Holoxos}} walked where
{{c|Blood}} flowed everywhere
From his fallen kin:
{{c|Sons}} of {{c|Arachnus}} thin

And sons of {{c|Myriapus}}
Who'd been victorious
In other times and places
Before death's embraces.

He drank their blood and bore
Two sons to explore
The paths of blood and death:
{{c|Thyrus}} drew his breath

From peaceful tradition,
{{c|Drinking}} by submission
Only blood of those
Who'd found their last repose.

But {{c|Ricinus}} turned dark
And left his evil mark
On all the world around—
Where he could be found

He fed on living blood
Like some unholy flood
Of evil and of greed
That plants destruction's seed.

{{c|Ricinus}} drinks the life
From those in joy and strife,
{{c|Injecting}} with his bite
{{c|Venom}} through the night

That paralyzes those
He's chosen as his foes.
{{c|Paralytic}}, sweaty,
His venom's never petty

But always brings the pain
Like some unholy rain
That falls on those who can't
{{c|Escape}} his evil grant.

{{c|Ricinus}} swells up
Like some unholy cup
{{c|Inflated}} with the blood
Of innocents, a flood

Of stolen life that flows
Within him as he grows
{{c|Fat}} with others' pain
Like some unholy stain

Upon the world of life
That cuts like sharpest knife
Through all that's good and true
In me and you.

By {{c|Ricinus}} the blood
Of scorned women's flood
May taint our mortal veins
With all their bitter pains.

When {{c|Lilith}}'s blood flows in
Our veins, we can't win
Against the poison's might:
{{c|Typhus}} brings its blight

And {{c|Spotted}} {{c|Fever}} too
To me and you
Who cannot fight alone
Against what we have sown

By letting evil in
Our world where it can win
Against the good and true
That lives in me and you.

The {{c|Midichlorians}} live
In what {{c|Ricinus}}' give:
Within their mitochondria
{{c|Lives}} {{c|Lilith}}'s bacteria—

The greatest revenge told
By stories new and old
Of those who choose the dark
And leave their evil mark.

And after daughters come
Of {{c|Lilith}}, and the sum
Of all their evil ways:
{{c|Malarius}}' dark days

And {{c|Lyme}} and all the rest
Of sisters who're possessed
By pestilence and death
That steals away our breath.

{{c|Ricinus}}, father of
{{c|Ticks}} who show no love
But only greed and hate,
{{c|Engorged}} with others' fate,

{{c|Shows}} us what becomes
Of those whose evil sums
Into a force so strong
That right can't win from wrong.

But {{c|Eurypter}} would be
{{c|Father}} of dynasty
{{c|Far}} greater than the line
Of {{c|Chasmas}}' design.

A nation he would make
That would its rightful take
Of glory and of might
To fill the world with sight

Of what the good can do
When they are tried and true
To principles of right
That shine like morning light

Through all the world's dark places
Where evil shows its faces
But cannot win the day
When good shows its way.

From {{c|Silur}}'s opportunity
Seen in calamity
To {{c|Opiliona}}'s care
For life everywhere,

From {{c|Book}} {{c|Knights}} who defend
The knowledge we depend
Upon to light our way
Through each and every day,

To those who choose the dark
And leave their evil mark
On all the world around
Where they can be found,

The {{c|Silurian}} shows
How each one's choice grows
Into the world we see
For you and me.

Some choose to heal and mend
What others would rend
{{c|Apart}} with greed and hate
That seals our mortal fate.

{{c|Others}} choose to take
For their own selfish sake
What others need to live
And never learn to give.

The lesson clear as day
{{c|Shows}} us the way
To choose what we will be
For all eternity:

Those who heal and bless
Or those who make the mess
That others have to clean
In places yet unseen.

From {{c|Silur}}'s royal crown
To blood-suckers who drown
The world in pain and death,
Each choice draws its breath

From what we hold most dear:
Love that casts out fear
Or fear that kills all love
And blocks the light above.

The choice is ours to make
In every step we take
Along life's winding road
Where we must bear the load

Of what our choices bring
To every living thing
That shares this world with us
In ways both glorious

And terrible to see
For you and me
Who must decide each day
Which path we'll take away.

The {{c|Silurian}} age began
With one who had a plan
To rise from ruin's call
And build hope for all.

But also shows how some
Will always choose to come
Down on the side of death
With their every breath.

The choice is always ours
To use our mortal powers
For good or ill each day
Along our living way.

From opportunity's call
To rise above the fall
Of golden ages past
To build what will last,

The {{c|Silurian}} reminds
Us that each one finds
The world they choose to make
For everyone's sake.

Choose well, for what you choose
Will be what you will lose
Or gain for all the days
Of your immortal ways.

From {{c|Silur}}'s royal start
To ticks' bloodsucking art,
The lesson's clear to see:
We are what we choose to be.
