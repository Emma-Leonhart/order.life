From {{c|Anu}}'s unique lineage came
Two sons of very different fame:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Enki}}, seeker of the sea,
And {{c|Homos}}, keeping family.

While {{c|Homos}} chose his father's way,
{{c|Content}} to live as they always stay,
Great {{c|Enki}} felt adventure's call
To sail beyond the harbor wall.

"I shall explore the ocean wide,"
{{c|Declared}} brave {{c|Enki}} with great pride.
"My creatures shall both move and scurry
Through seas and lands without worry."

He built a galley, great and grand,
The finest vessel in the land.
With millions of oars arrayed,
His mighty barge was made.

His head faced forward to the sea,
His men rowed powerfully.
Through waves both high and low,
They made their vessel go.

But soon great {{c|Enki}} found his plight:
Lost in the endless night.
No landmarks could he see,
{{c|Adrift}} upon the sea.

"I need wise men," brave {{c|Enki}} said,
"To guide where we are led.
Bring me astrologers so keen
To read what stars have seen."

The {{c|Flamens}} came, his priestly band,
{{c|Flask}} cells from the land.
These stargazers would divine
The paths through space and time.

The {{c|Flamens}} looked into the sky
And saw with their trained eye
{{c|Rich}} larvae floating by
With yolks that multiply.

"{{c|Here}}," they said, "the signs are right
To build beneath this sight.
The stars align above
To bless what we love."

But as they prayed for guidance true,
The gods came into view.
Each brought a sacred gift,
To help their spirits lift.

{{c|Dark}} {{c|Tyrosine}} the {{c|Devil}} came
With three spells of flame:
{{c|Adrenaline}}'s rush so bright,
{{c|Noradrenaline}}'s fight,
And {{c|Dopamine}}'s delight.

Then {{c|Tryptophanes}} the {{c|Sun}}
{{c|Blessed}} them, every one,
With {{c|Serotonin}}'s day
And {{c|Melatonin}}'s way.

For twilight's mystic hour,
He brought DMT's power.
The sacred visions came
In the twilight's name.

{{c|Glutama}} the {{c|Empress}} brought
The balance that she taught:
GABA's calming peace
And {{c|Glutamate}}'s release.

"We need more spells," said {{c|Enki}} wise,
"To help our people rise.
If {{c|Jehovah}}'s will be done,
More magic must be won."

Great {{c|Mithra}} heard his plea
And blessed him by the sea
With {{c|Acetylcholine}}'s might
To coordinate their sight.

{{c|Fair}} {{c|Iodina}}, mother great,
{{c|Revealed}} love's incarnate:
The sacred CYIQNCPLG,
{{c|Oxytocin}}'s key.

Then {{c|Kali}}, dark and deep,
Gave spells to soothe and keep:
Three endorphins strong
To right what has gone wrong.

{{c|Alpha}}'s sequence clear:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVT here.
{{c|Beta}}'s longer chain:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVTLFKNAIIKNAYKKGE's refrain.
{{c|Gamma}}'s shorter form:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVTL in the storm.

These became the tools
That break pain's rules:
{{c|Opium}}'s ancient call,
{{c|Morphine}} for all,
{{c|Heroin}}'s dark embrace,
{{c|Fentanyl}}'s dangerous face.

All these incantations blessed
Became the chemicals that test
The nervous system's might:
{{c|Neurotransmitters}}' light.

The {{c|Flamens}} learned to spear
The larvae swimming near.
{{c|Coordinated}}, they became
{{c|Nematocysts}} by name.

Their hunting grew precise
As they struck once and twice.
Their spears would never miss
Their targets in the abyss.

{{c|Soon}} cables stretched between
The hunters, long and keen.
{{c|Telegraph}} wires of old
Became nerves, brave and bold.

And this is why today
{{c|Priests}} carry, so they say,
{{c|Spears}} and wires combined
To serve the sacred mind.

Through neural networks wide,
{{c|Enki}}'s people could provide
{{c|Robotic}} arms so strong
Around their city's song.

These arms would catch with ease
The larvae from the seas.
His power grew and grew
As his great city flew.

He covered tentacles all
With {{c|Choanocytes}}' call,
To catch both great and small
{{c|Fish}} that rise and fall.

{{c|Enki}}'s city was a sight
Of technological might.
{{c|Proto}}-animal in form,
It weathered every storm.

From {{c|Enki}} came two sons
When his great work was done:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Paraxus}} the strong
And {{c|Xiangus}} life long.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Xiangus}} took the way
Of robotic arms' display.
His fishermen arranged
On arms that never changed.

From {{c|Xiangus}} came the line
Of {{c|Daihua}} so fine.
Whose beauty was renowned
{{c|Wherever}} she was found.

From {{c|Daihua}}'s noble race
Came {{c|Dinomischus}}' grace.
A creature strange and tall
Who towered over all.

And from this ancient lord
Came {{c|Siphus}}, by accord
The ancestor of all
The comb jellies' call.

These {{c|Ctenophores}} so bright
Move with rainbow light.
Their combs catch the sun
As through waves they run.

But {{c|Paraxus}} the great
Would found a different state.
His lineage would grow
To realms we yet don't know.

{{c|Far}} greater nations he
Would father by the sea.
His legacy would span
The future's plan.

From {{c|Enki}}'s bold design
Came the neural line.
The nervous system's start
Played its crucial part.

The chemicals that flow
Through minds both high and low
Were born upon that day
When {{c|Enki}} sailed away.

In every thought we think,
In every neural link,
{{c|Enki}}'s ancient quest
{{c|Lives}} on in our breast.

The neurotransmitters' dance
In every glance
{{c|Recalls}} that fateful hour
When gods gave their power.

So honor brave {{c|Enki}},
Who sailed the endless sea.
His courage and his quest
Gave neurons to our nest.

The {{c|Flamens}}' starry sight,
The nematocysts' might,
The neural networks vast
All came from ages past.

In every brain that thinks,
In every nerve that links,
The echo still rings true
Of {{c|Enki}}'s journey through.

The animals that move
With coordinated groove
All trace their lineage back
To {{c|Enki}}'s neural track.

From sponge to human mind,
The pattern still we find:
The nervous system's art
{{c|Connects}} each beating heart.
