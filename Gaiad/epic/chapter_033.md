Among the three great ancestors,
Those ancient processors,
{{c|Spiralius}} was most conservative,
His ways preservative.

He fished with tentacles long,
As fathers had done strong.
The ancient art he kept alive
To help his children thrive.

Great {{c|Spiralius}} worked each day
In his diligent way
To provide for children all
Who answered duty's call.

Among his many sons of fame
Two earned eternal name:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Kimberella}} the king
And {{c|Gnathifer}}'s ring.

{{c|Kimberella}} earned his fame
Through his eternal name.
His tomb is visited today
By pilgrims on their way.

The greatest king was he
Of his time's dynasty.
His kingdom moved with might
Across the steppe so bright.

A billion years of fame
{{c|Belongs}} to his great name.
On {{c|Australian}} stamps today
His image holds its sway.

But {{c|Gnathifer}} chose a different path,
To show his righteous wrath.
A kingdom small but quick
He built with cunning trick.

Like {{c|Ectus}} he could see
The need for weaponry.
A great jaw he built with care
From chitin strong and fair.

A sugar jaw so sweet
For sugar treats to eat,
But though his jaw was sugar-made,
His heart was not so stayed.

With ferocious jaws so bright
He brought the fearsome sight
To sons of {{c|Isomeres}}
{{c|Throughout}} their territories.

In old age from his loins
Came two, like ancient coins:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Gnathos}}, fierce and wild,
And {{c|Hydrover}}, gentler child.

{{c|Gnathos}} was vicious
More than malicious.
His sons are known today
As {{c|Jaw}} {{c|Worms}} in their way.

But {{c|Xenognath}} was different,
Though still belligerent.
He grew jaws within jaws,
Against all natural laws.

{{c|Fifteen}} jaws in all he made,
A fearsome masquerade.
Each jaw within the last
Held prey both firm and fast.

From {{c|Xenognath}} came two sons:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Marinus}}, who runs
The seas with might and main,
And {{c|Limnos}} of the rain.

{{c|Marinus}} fought and fought
For all that could be caught.
{{c|Dominion}} of the sea
Was his priority.

But {{c|Limnos}} was cast out
From the ocean's route.
Into the rivers sent,
His kingdom there was bent.

The sons of {{c|Marinus}} mock
Their freshwater flock:
"{{c|Small}} jawed ones," they call
Their cousins one and all.

From {{c|Marinus}} came two more:
{{c|Rotiferus}} to explore
And brave {{c|Amisquius}},
{{c|Bold}} and glorious.

{{c|Rotiferus}} looked around
And peaceful living found
Among {{c|Kimberella}}'s line,
Their ways both good and fine.

He turned to fishing once again,
Like his ancient kin.
His sons became the nomads true,
The {{c|Rotifers}} we view.

In all waters they roam,
{{c|Making}} everywhere home.
Great fishermen are they
From night until the day.

He built his coelom loose
Like {{c|Ectus}} let loose.
This gave him speed and grace
In every watery place.

In rotifer villages
They practice their privileges.
{{c|Fishing}} with their wheels
For all their daily meals.

But among his sons there was
One who broke the laws.
{{c|Acanthus}} the red, so base,
A parasite's disgrace.

He lives in others' guts
And steals like greedy nuts
The food that should belong
To those both right and strong.

Such thievery brings shame
To {{c|Rotiferus}}' name.
A black sheep in the fold
Whose story should be told.

But from {{c|Amisquius}} came
A line of greater fame.
Each generation grew
{{c|Jaws}} bigger through and through.

In {{c|Nimrod}} {{c|Bristletongue}}'s time
Their power reached its prime.
They ruled the seas with might,
A fearsome, awesome sight.

More numerous than all
Who answered ocean's call,
The {{c|Arrow}} {{c|Worms}} became
The hunters' greatest name.

The greatest hunters ever seen
Beneath the ocean green.
Their jaws could catch and hold
The bravest and the bold.

Through waters dark and deep
Their vigil they do keep.
No prey can swim away
From their hunting display.

The conservative path
{{c|Sometimes}} shows its wrath
In children who rebel
And stories they do tell.

{{c|Spiralius}} kept the old ways true
But his children grew
In many different directions,
{{c|Making}} their selections.

Some stayed with fishing pure,
Their methods tried and sure.
{{c|Others}} chose the warrior's way
To fight another day.

From tentacles to jaws,
{{c|Following}} nature's laws,
Each lineage found its place
In evolution's race.

The rotifer's gentle art
Of fishing warms the heart.
While arrow worms show might
In predatory sight.

Both trace their lineage back
To {{c|Spiralius}}' track.
The conservative way
Led to diverse display.

In every freshwater pond
Where rotifers respond
To plankton floating by
Beneath the morning sky,

Remember their ancestor
Who was fishing's protector.
{{c|Spiralius}} kept the art
That gave them their start.

In every arrow worm
That makes the sea fish squirm,
His heritage lives on
From dusk until the dawn.

The three great patriarchs
Left their lasting marks
On all life in the sea
Through all eternity.

But {{c|Spiralius}} shows us well
That traditions tell
{{c|Important}} truths that last
Through future and past.

{{c|Innovation}} has its place
In evolution's race,
But keeping what works true
Is wisdom through and through.
