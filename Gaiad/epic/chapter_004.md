The tale of {{c|12|Rhodes}} and {{c|13|Marigold}} begins,
A union forged in stars, their love so bright.
The first of lovers bound, their fate still spins,
A cosmic dance that guides us through the night.

{{c|12|Rhodes}}, son of {{c|8|Ruby}}, dim with crimson glow,
And {{c|13|Marigold}}, of {{c|9|Chrystella}}'s bright line,
Were joined in love, the stars watched from below,
The first celestial bond, forever fine.

Their love was strong, unwavering and true,
Though {{c|13|Marigold}} was bright, a shining flame,
While {{c|12|Rhodes}}, much smaller, dim in ruby hue,
Yet still their hearts burned with a single name.

As years passed on, {{c|13|Marigold}}'s light grew red,
Her youthful glow now fading into age.
She gave her breath to {{c|12|Rhodes}}, who soared ahead,
And shone with yellow light, her bright young stage.

As {{c|13|Marigold}} grew small, her light turned white,
Yet {{c|12|Rhodes}} stayed close, his glow now burning red.
From novas born, came lithium's bright light,
A starry gift, as love between them spread.

The nova's burst had filled his heart with fear,
So {{c|12|Rhodes}} withheld his gift for many years.
For twenty-five, the skies stayed calm and clear,
Until again, their love burst forth with cheers.

For countless years, their rhythm stayed the same,
Each nova lighting skies with love’s great might.
Once every age, their gift became a flame,
A cycle known as Nova’s sacred light.

As time went on, they both grew small and white,
Yet side by side, they watched the stars they made.
Their children shining in the nebula’s light,
A legacy of love that would not fade.

And now, we honor them in wedding vows,
With ruby rings for one, and topaz bright.
White opal marks the bond that time allows,
A symbol of their love’s enduring light.
