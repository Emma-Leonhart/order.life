# Capricorn (2宮) - Days 29-56

*The Saga of the Ocean - From Cambrian to Devonian*

---

In {{c|Terra}}'s rivers, flowing free,
Two lineages would come to be
{{c|United}} in a bond so strong
That lasted both their whole life long.

Great {{c|Symbio-Mygus}}, fungal lord,
{{c|Son}} of {{c|Mygus}} by accord,
{{c|Tenth}} generation from the line
Of {{c|Zygos}}, ancient and divine.

{{c|Fair}} {{c|Charina-Planta}} bright,
{{c|Daughter}} of photosynthetic light,
{{c|Tenth}} from {{c|Charina}}'s algae clan
That lived where river waters ran.

These two would meet beside the shore
Of {{c|Lichen}} {{c|Lake}}, as none before.
A marriage of such different kinds:
The fungus with the plant combines.

"Come, fair maiden of the green,"
Said {{c|Symbio}}-{{c|Mygus}}, king serene.
"Let us join our different ways
And rule through all our living days."

"I capture light from sunny skies,
You gather nutrients that arise
From earth and stone and decay.
{{c|Together}} we can rule the day."

{{c|Charina}}-{{c|Planta}} heard his call
And agreed to join with all
Her photosynthetic might
To his fungal appetite.

"A fusion we shall create,"
She said, "to meet our fate.
{{c|Plant}} and fungus, side by side,
We'll conquer land both far and wide."

Their marriage was a wondrous sight,
Two kingdoms joining in their might.
An agricultural empire grand
Rose up to claim the fertile land.

When {{c|Lichen}} {{c|Lake}} was full and high,
They thrived beneath the open sky.
But when the waters dried away,
They slept until another day.

{{c|Dormant}} in the drought they lay,
{{c|Waiting}} for the rain's display.
When water came, they rose again
To rule their vast domain.

{{c|Together}} they bore children bright,
The lichens, filled with dual might.
Each one a fusion of their line,
Both fungal strong and plant divine.

{{c|Countless}} forms they took with glee,
Each suited to their destiny.
{{c|Fruticose}} lichens, tall and proud,
Like trees they rose above the crowd.

{{c|Reindeer}} {{c|Moss}} spread far and wide,
{{c|Goldeneye}} {{c|Lichen}} by their side.
{{c|Cladonia}}'s cups held morning dew,
While {{c|Old}} {{c|Man}}'s {{c|Hair}} in breeches grew.

The great foliose lichens came,
{{c|Leafy}} beauties earning fame.
{{c|Ruffle}} {{c|Lichen}}, soft and fair,
{{c|Pillow}} {{c|Lichen}} everywhere.

{{c|Physcia}} spread his leafy form
To weather every kind of storm.
These leafy beauties caught the light
And made the barren places bright.

The crusty crustose lichens strong
Could survive both short and long
The harshest places, dry and rough,
Where other life was not enough.

{{c|Rime}} {{c|Lichen}} on the mountain height,
{{c|Orange}} {{c|Sea}} {{c|Lichen}}, burning bright.
So tough they were, so strong to last,
They held when other life had passed.

The powdery leprose clan
{{c|Spread}} everywhere that they began.
{{c|Breaking}} apart upon the wind,
{{c|New}} territories they would find.

{{c|Leprose}} {{c|Lichen}}, golden dust,
{{c|Scattered}} with the wind's great thrust.
{{c|Golden}} particles would fly
To colonize both low and high.

Some lichens chose the hardest way,
{{c|Living}} in the rock to stay.
{{c|Endolithic}} forms so small
Made stone their home and all.

{{c|Ruby}} {{c|Firedot}}, burning red,
In solid rock made his bed.
Where nothing else could ever live,
He had his life to give.

The filamentous lichens came
To play a protective game.
They guarded cyanobacteria
From harm in every area.

{{c|Ephebe}} wrapped his threads around
The blue-green life that he had found.
{{c|Together}} they would make their home
Where neither could survive alone.

And strangest of them all to see
Were jelly lichens by the sea.
In gelatinous embrace
They found their living space.

{{c|Tar}} {{c|Jelly}} {{c|Lichen}}, dark and thick,
With cyanobacteria's magic trick.
In jelly they would swim and live,
And mutual aid they'd give.

But {{c|Symbio}}-{{c|Mygus}}, great though he,
Took another bride to see.
{{c|Trentophila}}, daughter fair
Of {{c|Trent}}, with golden hair.

The daughters of {{c|Trentophila}}
{{c|Spread}} far across the area.
They colonized the world around
With partnership they'd found.

Some turned to parasitic ways,
Like {{c|Cephaleura}} in her days.
She envied {{c|Amber}}'s daughters bright
And stole their photosynthetic light.

But greatest of all partnerships
Were those that sailed on nature's ships:
The daughters of fair {{c|Amber}} true
And sons of {{c|Arbusculus}} too.

Great {{c|Amber}} wed {{c|Arbusculus}},
Their union glorious.
They bore both {{c|Glomer}} and {{c|Ashley}},
A pair both strong and free.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Ashley}} wed with {{c|Wort}} the wise,
And from their love there would arise
The ancestors of plants so green
And mosses, fairest ever seen.

A city they built upon the land,
Both beautiful and grand.
The first to leave the water's hold
And stake their claim so bold.

But {{c|Ashley}} could not stand alone
Upon the land of stone.
She needed help to gather food
From soil that was not good.

So {{c|Glomer}}, brother true and kind,
{{c|Connected}} with his mind
A network underground to share
The nutrients found there.

Like his lichen brothers old,
{{c|Glomer}}'s story would be told
Of partnerships that help us thrive
And keep the world alive.

He dug into the earthen ground
Where minerals could be found.
While {{c|Ashley}} farmed in sunny light,
Their trade was mutual delight.

{{c|Ashley}} and {{c|Wort}} bore children countless,
Their progeny were boundless.
But raising young on land so dry
Required help from fungi nigh.

So {{c|Glomer}} built a network vast
That would forever last:
The {{c|Wood}} {{c|Wide}} {{c|Web}}, that ancient net
That serves the forests yet.

An underground economy
Of mutual harmony.
Each plant could trade with every other
Through their fungal brother.

The wood wide web was not a bubble,
{{c|Glomer}} solved their trouble.
He became the first to see
That cooperation sets us free.

His startup grew beyond all measure,
A network of such treasure.
{{c|Today}} he holds the largest share
Of fungal networks everywhere.

With eighty percent market hold,
His story still is told.
WoodNet service, tried and true,
{{c|Connects}} the forest through and through.

But other fungi joined the game,
Each seeking their own fame.
{{c|Ectomycorrhizae}} came
To play the network's game.

{{c|Amazon}} became a part
Of this great networked art.
The {{c|Wood}} {{c|Wide}} {{c|Web}} spreads far and wide
Through every forest side.

By this great union's might
Of {{c|Symbio}}-{{c|Mygus}}' sight
And {{c|Charina}}-{{c|Planta}}'s power,
They conquered every hour.

They built their civilization grand
Upon the fertile land.
So great their empire grew to be
That it changed history.

Like daughters of {{c|Saya}} before,
Who'd opened evolution's door,
These lichens and their fungal kin
Made the ice age begin.

And so began the {{c|Cryogenian}},
That age humanitarian.
The world froze over, white and cold,
As their great story told.

But in their icy reign supreme,
They lived the partnership dream.
That plant and fungus, side by side,
Could in the cold abide.

So honor {{c|Symbio}}-{{c|Mygus}} true
And {{c|Charina}}-{{c|Planta}} too.
Their marriage showed the world the way
That partnerships can stay.

In every lichen that you see
Upon the rock or tree,
Their legacy lives on today
In symbiotic display.

From mountain peak to ocean shore,
Their children evermore
Show us how two different kinds
Can join their hearts and minds.

The {{c|Wood}} {{c|Wide}} {{c|Web}} beneath our feet
{{c|Makes}} forest life complete.
The network that they started long
{{c|Ago}} still sings its song.

In partnership we find our strength,
We'll go to any length
To help each other as we grow
Through all that we may know.

The lichen's lesson, tried and true:
{{c|Together}}, me and you
Can face whatever storm may come
And never be undone.

---

This is the chronicle of {{c|Cnider}},
Who sat upon a rock so wide
And built on each side of his throne
A row of mouths, his very own.

With tentacles reaching down below,
A great column all aglow,
He made his city on the stone
Where he would rule all alone.

His fishermen in lines he placed,
A {{c|Siphonoglyph}}, perfectly spaced.
Down each mouth, with skillful art,
Each played their fishing part.

Great {{c|Cnider}} made a sacred pact
With {{c|Luna}}, keeping their contract.
By her blessing, bright and true,
On the full moon he bore two.

Two sons came in her silver light:
{{c|Traditional}} {{c|Anthus}}, shining bright,
And bold {{c|Anaxydros}} the new,
Whose innovations would shine through.

To this day when {{c|Luna}}'s face
{{c|Shines}} full upon the watery place,
The sons of {{c|Cnider}} and fair {{c|Nettle}}
Their reproductive matters settle.

By moonlight they bear their young,
As {{c|Luna}}'s ancient song is sung.
The tidal pull, the silver beam
{{c|Fulfill}} their reproductive dream.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Anthus}} kept the ancient way,
{{c|Following}} tradition's display.
His children built their homes on stone
And never far from land they'd roam.

But bold {{c|Anaxydros}} chose to change,
His innovations were strange.
From him came children two:
{{c|Pompom}} and {{c|Meduson}} true.

Great {{c|Pompom}} chose the stalked path,
To weather time and nature's wrath.
He built upon the ocean floor
And opened innovation's door.

From {{c|Pompom}} came two sons of might:
{{c|Conos}} and {{c|Stauros}}, burning bright.
The stalked jellyfish they became,
{{c|Adding}} to their ancestor's fame.

But {{c|Meduson}} chose a different way,
He would not on the bottom stay.
A new city he did build
That with wanderlust was filled.

His city floated in the sea,
{{c|Drifting}} wild and drifting free.
The ancestor of jellyfish,
He granted their floating wish.

At first he had no direction,
Just aimless drift without connection.
He picked up what he could find
While floating with the tide.

But soon an idea came to him
As he floated, free to swim:
"Why should I drift where currents go?
I'll pump and swim both high and low!"

He learned to pump his body tight
And shoot through water with delight.
No more would he helpless drift—
His swimming was his gift.

Meanwhile the sons of {{c|Anthus}} grew
Across the oceans, deep and blue.
Among them were the {{c|Anemones}},
Who swayed like flowered trees.

And {{c|Corals}} built their cities grand
Upon the ocean's shifting sand.
With {{c|Zooxanthellae}} they'd farm
And keep their cities free from harm.

{{c|Zoochlorellae}}, green and bright,
Helped them capture morning light.
These partnerships would make
The reefs for others' sake.

From {{c|Meduson}} came children two:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Diplos}} and sweet {{c|Jelly}} true.
Each would take a different path
Through ocean's joy and wrath.

{{c|Fair}} {{c|Jelly}} bore two mighty lines
Of jellyfish with grand designs:
The {{c|Cubozoans}}, box-shaped, wise,
Who learned to use their eyes.

And {{c|Scyphozoans}}, "{{c|True}} {{c|Jellyfish}},"
Who granted many a sailor's wish
To see their beauty in the deep
Where ocean secrets keep.

The sons of {{c|Scyphos}} numbered high,
Beneath the sea and sky.
Each polyp bore a myriad young
Whose praises would be sung.

{{c|Pacific}} {{c|Sea}} {{c|Nettle}} swam
Through waters like a swimming ram.
Their trailing tentacles so long
Made predators think twice.

But {{c|Cubos}} was a father kind,
With caring heart and mind.
He bore but few children dear
And held each one near.

We pray to {{c|Cubos}} when we seek
To be fathers strong, not weak.
His example shows the way
To care for young each day.

The eyes of {{c|Cubos}}, complex, true,
Could see through waters blue.
No simple spots of light were these,
But eyes that truly seize.

Each detail in the liquid space,
Each movement, form, and face.
The box jellyfish today
Still see in {{c|Cubos}}' way.

From {{c|Cnider}}'s ancient line
Came forms both crude and fine.
Some stayed upon the rocky shore
While others chose to soar.

The anemones wave their arms
Like flowers with their charms.
But touch them and you'll feel the sting
Of cnidocytes' ring.

The corals build their reefs so grand,
{{c|Cities}} throughout the land
Beneath the waves they rise
Like underwater skies.

Each polyp in its cup
{{c|Reaches}} tentacles up
To catch the food that drifts
Through water's gentle shifts.

The jellyfish that swim so free
Through every part of sea
Show us how to move with grace
Through life's embrace.

Some drift with current's flow,
{{c|Others}} choose where they go.
Each strategy has its place
In ocean's vast space.

The cnidarian way
{{c|Lives}} on in every bay
Where tentacles reach out
Without a doubt.

From {{c|Cnider}}'s rocky throne
His children, fully grown,
{{c|Spread}} through the waters wide
With tentacles as guide.

In every sting you feel
From jellyfish so real,
Remember {{c|Cnider}}'s art
That gave them their start.

The radial symmetry
Of their biology
{{c|Shows}} patterns clean and true
In everything they do.

So honor great {{c|Cnider}},
That ancient provider
Who sat upon his stone
And made the sea his own.

His covenant with {{c|Luna}}'s light
Still guides them through the night.
When the full moon shines above,
They make their spawn with love.

The cnidarians today
Still follow {{c|Cnider}}'s way:
With tentacles they hunt
And do their survival stunt.

From simple to complex,
From polyp to apex,
The jellyfish still roam
Through ocean's salty foam.

When {{c|Cambrius}} and {{c|Spriggina}} died,
Great heroes who had ruled with pride,
Two sons were left to claim their throne:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Protos}} and {{c|Dutrus}}, each alone.

Each brother saw a different way
To honor what their parents' legacy would say.
The body plan that they had made
Would be interpreted and obeyed.

Great {{c|Protos}} looked upon the form
And said, "I'll keep the ancient norm.
The first hole is the mouth so wide,
The second is where waste will hide."

"The mesoderm is like the past,
{{c|Mesoglea}} that will last.
My mouth shall bear tentacles bright
Like fathers did in ancient sight."

"O heathen, do you not see
The anus brings us victory?
For generations we did bathe
In filth, but now we are saved!"

"We keep our mouths so clean and pure
And eat food nutritious, sure.
The endoderm, ectoderm, three—
The mesoderm—shall ever be!"

"These layers never shall we mix,
For they're civilization's fix.
The foundation, tried and true,
Shall guide us in all that we do."

But bold {{c|Dutrus}} saw it not the same,
He'd make a different claim:
"The second hole's the mouth, I say,
The first hole takes waste away."

"The mesoderm is something more
{{c|Than}} what we've seen before.
Beyond mesoglea it goes,
Where fisherman and shieldmaid grows."

"A reunion, don't you see,
Of ancient unity?
{{c|Choanoderm}} and {{c|Archaeocyte}}
{{c|Together}} in the fight."

"O heathen, can't you understand?
The mouth is progress' hand!
What we take into our core
{{c|Shapes}} what we have in store."

"What we expel is just the past,
But what we eat will last.
By joining old with new again
We'll build a glorious reign."

And so the war began to rage,
Upon history's page.
Whose vision would define the way
For the {{c|Cambrian}} display?

Each brother bore two sons of might
To join the coming fight:
From {{c|Dutrus}} came both brave and true
{{c|Dietrich}} and {{c|Saccorhytus}} too.

From {{c|Protos}} came with valor high
{{c|Ectus}} and {{c|Spiralius}} nigh.
Four grandsons of the ancient line
Would make their fates align.

{{c|Strange}} {{c|Saccorhytus}} had no rear,
No anus did appear.
With no way to expel his waste,
His life would not be graced.

So {{c|Dutrus}}' legacy fell
To {{c|Dietrich}}, who served him well.
The loyal son would carry on
Until his life was done.

The sons of {{c|Dutrus}}, it was known,
{{c|Throughout}} the world had grown
{{c|Famous}} for their heads so wise,
But {{c|Dietrich}} had no eyes.

No head had he to lead the way,
But innovation saved the day.
He built himself a tail so strong
To move his life along.

Through muddy ground he made his path
{{c|Avoiding}} others' wrath.
With two nerve cords to guide his course
He found prosperity's source.

He settled down and built a home,
A colony where he could roam.
His simple plan worked very well
In his ancestral dell.

Great {{c|Spiralius}} kept the faith
And avoided common wraith.
He built his city like a top,
A trochophore that would not stop.

With tentacles both long and wide
He fished from side to side.
No fisherman had been before
As skilled upon the shore.

His wealth grew day by day
In his prosperous way.
The trochophore design proved true
For all that he would do.

But {{c|Ectus}} was a bitter soul,
{{c|Resentment}} was his goal.
The secondborn who felt the slight
Would make his grievance right.

"I'll be the greatest of them all,"
He answered duty's call.
"Among {{c|Cambrius}}' sons I'll shine
And make the victory mine."

His tentacles he changed to teeth,
{{c|Ferocious}} underneath.
He shed his skin to stay young,
While battle songs were sung.

With muscles strong and flexing true
He leaped at all he knew.
His prey would never get away
From {{c|Ectus}}' fierce display.

"O eldest sons, beware!" he cried,
"Take caution in your pride!
The legacy belongs to those
Who defeat all their foes!"

And so he declared a war
That would spread both near and far.
Against {{c|Dutrus}} and {{c|Spiralius}} both
He swore his solemn oath.

The sons of {{c|Dutrus}}, brave and true,
The sons of {{c|Spiralius}} too,
And {{c|Ectus}} with his fearsome might
{{c|Prepared}} for the great fight.

These three great tribes would write
The story of their sight.
Their conflict would define the age
On evolution's stage.

And so began that time of fame
When diversity's flame
{{c|Burned}} bright across the ancient sea:
The {{c|Cambrian}}'s legacy.

{{c|Bodies}} burst in forms unknown,
As each tribe made their throne.
{{c|Innovations}} everywhere
{{c|Filled}} the water and the air.

{{c|Predator}} and prey alike
{{c|Prepared}} for war to strike.
{{c|Arms}} races would begin
As each sought to win.

The filter feeders found their place
While hunters gave chase.
Some burrowed deep in mud
While others spilled their blood.

{{c|Eyes}} evolved to see the light,
{{c|Shells}} appeared for the fight.
{{c|Claws}} and spines and armor thick
Made survival's trick.

The explosion had begun
{{c|Underneath}} the ancient sun.
{{c|Cambrius}}' legacy lived on
From dusk until the dawn.

In every creature that we see
{{c|Lives}} this ancient memory:
The choice between the old and new
{{c|Shapes}} all that we do.

Some kept the ancient, simple way
While others chose to stay
{{c|Innovative}}, bold, and bright
In evolution's sight.

The war between the brothers three
{{c|Lives}} on in you and me.
In every choice we make each day
We follow their display.

{{c|Innovation}} or tradition,
Each makes its submission
To the force of life that drives
All that grows and thrives.

So honor brave {{c|Cambrius}},
Who started all this fuss.
His legacy lives on today
In every living way.

The {{c|Cambrian}} explosion's fire
{{c|Burns}} on with desire
In every form of life we see
Through all eternity.

In the age of patriarchs three,
{{c|Dutrus}}, {{c|Ectus}}, {{c|Spiralius}} free,
Among these lords of ancient might,
{{c|Ectus}} was the fearsome sight.

With mouth agape and teeth so sharp,
He played destruction's harp.
Through enemies he ripped and tore,
Like none had done before.

The sons of {{c|Isomeres}} fair
And sponges everywhere
Fell victim to his raiding spree
Across the ancient sea.

A complex mouth he built with care
To catch prey everywhere.
He molted skin and mouth with time,
In rhythm and in rhyme.

His cilia he cast away
For a more effective way.
{{c|Amoebae}} became his sperm,
A change both strange and firm.

His coelom he stripped down bare,
{{c|Removed}} what wasn't there
For function true and speed.
He kept only what he'd need.

{{c|Unnecessary}} scaffolding
He cast off like a ring.
His organs floated free inside
His pseudocoelom wide.

In burrowing he found his art,
{{c|Playing}} the hunter's part.
Through sediment he'd tear and rend
Until his foes would end.

The first predator was he
Upon the ancient sea.
The sons of {{c|Dutrus}} and {{c|Spiralius}}
Fell to his might so glorious.

In viciousness he bore a horde
Of worms who served their lord.
They conquered earth from shore to shore
And always wanted more.

Through earth great {{c|Ectus}} ripped
While soil from him slipped.
{{c|Destruction}} was his name
And carnage was his game.

From {{c|Ectus}} came two sons of might:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Ishmael}}, ready to fight,
And clever {{c|Isaac}}, young and wise,
Who sought innovation's prize.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Ishmael}} held fast and true
To all his father knew.
{{c|Tradition}} was his guiding star
Through peace and times of war.

But {{c|Isaac}} chose a different way,
{{c|Innovation}}'s display.
He'd build upon his father's art
But with a newer heart.

From {{c|Ishmael}}'s faithful line
Came {{c|Priapus}}, strong and fine.
{{c|Patriarch}} of the {{c|Priapulids}},
Who live where darkness hides.

{{c|Deep}} in the ocean's depths they dwell
In places none can tell.
Like ancient {{c|Ediacaran}} lands
Of hydrogen sulfide strands.

Without oxygen they thrive
And keep their line alive.
In waters dark and deep they stay
Until the judgment day.

{{c|Draco}}, {{c|Priapus}}' brother true,
Became patriarch too.
The mud dragons, horrific, wild,
Each nature's problem child.

Through muds they make their way
Both night and day.
{{c|Monsters}} in the deep they are
Beneath each shining star.

From {{c|Isaac}} came two sons of fame:
{{c|Nematus}} was his name,
And {{c|Rhineheart}}, bold and strong,
Would live his whole life long.

{{c|Nematus}} was quick and spry,
A nomad 'neath the sky.
He bore two sons to carry on:
{{c|Nematus}} II and {{c|Gordy}}'s song.

Both sons became prodigal,
Their ways not traditional.
They turned to parasitic life
And caused their father strife.

But in his aging years,
Through sorrows and through tears,
{{c|Nematus}} left that way behind
And peace within him did find.

He became the ancestor great
Of worms throughout their state.
{{c|Eighty}} percent of animals
Are his descendants all.

His city was a sight to see
Of worm community.
From simple to complex they grew
In everything they'd do.

But {{c|Gordy}} chose the parasite way
And never did stray
From living in his brother's flesh,
His host's blood, warm and fresh.

The {{c|Gordian}} worms are his line,
{{c|Horrific}} by design.
They live within their victims' hearts
And tear their lives apart.

From {{c|Rhineheart}} came two more:
{{c|Lobopus}} to explore
And brave {{c|Loricus}}, armored well
With stories he would tell.

{{c|Loricus}} built armor thick
To protect from every trick.
He married {{c|Siri}}, maiden fair,
And lived beyond compare.

His sons live in the depths below
Where mysteries grow.
For half a billion years we thought
Their line to nothing brought.

But in nineteen eighty-three
We found them in the sea.
{{c|Alive}} and well they dwelt
Where pressure could be felt.

The {{c|Loricifer}}'s tale
Would never fail.
{{c|Living}} fossils in the deep
Their ancient vigil keep.

These descendants of great {{c|Ectus}}
Show what can protect us:
Some armor, some speed,
Some parasitic greed.

The worms that rule the earth today
In their own way
Remember their ancestor's might
Who brought the predator's sight.

In every garden bed
Where earthworms make their tread,
The legacy lives on
From dusk until the dawn.

In every parasite
That causes fear and fright,
{{c|Ectus}}' spirit lives to tell
His predatory spell.

From mud dragon's lair
To ocean depths so rare,
His children roam the world
With tentacles unfurled.

The age of three patriarchs
Left its lasting marks
On all the world we see
Through all eternity.

But {{c|Ectus}}, most of all,
{{c|Heeded}} evolution's call
To be the hunter fierce and true
In all that he would do.

His legacy of tooth and claw
Became nature's law:
That predator and prey must dance
In life's great circumstance.

So honor fierce {{c|Ectus}},
Who was so ravenous.
His hunger drove the change
Through evolution's range.

Without his predator's art
{{c|Life}} could not start
The arms race that would lead
To every living creed.

In every creature's fight
To live another night,
{{c|Ectus}}' spirit burns bright
Through all its might.

---

Among the three great ancestors,
Those ancient processors,
{{c|Spiralius}} was most conservative,
His ways preservative.

He fished with tentacles long,
As fathers had done strong.
The ancient art he kept alive
To help his children thrive.

Great {{c|Spiralius}} worked each day
In his diligent way
To provide for children all
Who answered duty's call.

Among his many sons of fame
Two earned eternal name:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Kimberella}} the king
And {{c|Gnathifer}}'s ring.

{{c|Kimberella}} earned his fame
Through his eternal name.
His tomb is visited today
By pilgrims on their way.

The greatest king was he
Of his time's dynasty.
His kingdom moved with might
Across the steppe so bright.

A billion years of fame
{{c|Belongs}} to his great name.
On {{c|Australian}} stamps today
His image holds its sway.

But {{c|Gnathifer}} chose a different path,
To show his righteous wrath.
A kingdom small but quick
He built with cunning trick.

Like {{c|Ectus}} he could see
The need for weaponry.
A great jaw he built with care
From chitin strong and fair.

A sugar jaw so sweet
For sugar treats to eat,
But though his jaw was sugar-made,
His heart was not so stayed.

With ferocious jaws so bright
He brought the fearsome sight
To sons of {{c|Isomeres}}
{{c|Throughout}} their territories.

In old age from his loins
Came two, like ancient coins:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Gnathos}}, fierce and wild,
And {{c|Hydrover}}, gentler child.

{{c|Gnathos}} was vicious
More than malicious.
His sons are known today
As {{c|Jaw}} {{c|Worms}} in their way.

But {{c|Xenognath}} was different,
Though still belligerent.
He grew jaws within jaws,
Against all natural laws.

{{c|Fifteen}} jaws in all he made,
A fearsome masquerade.
Each jaw within the last
Held prey both firm and fast.

From {{c|Xenognath}} came two sons:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Marinus}}, who runs
The seas with might and main,
And {{c|Limnos}} of the rain.

{{c|Marinus}} fought and fought
For all that could be caught.
{{c|Dominion}} of the sea
Was his priority.

But {{c|Limnos}} was cast out
From the ocean's route.
Into the rivers sent,
His kingdom there was bent.

The sons of {{c|Marinus}} mock
Their freshwater flock:
"{{c|Small}} jawed ones," they call
Their cousins one and all.

From {{c|Marinus}} came two more:
{{c|Rotiferus}} to explore
And brave {{c|Amisquius}},
{{c|Bold}} and glorious.

{{c|Rotiferus}} looked around
And peaceful living found
Among {{c|Kimberella}}'s line,
Their ways both good and fine.

He turned to fishing once again,
Like his ancient kin.
His sons became the nomads true,
The {{c|Rotifers}} we view.

In all waters they roam,
{{c|Making}} everywhere home.
Great fishermen are they
From night until the day.

He built his coelom loose
Like {{c|Ectus}} let loose.
This gave him speed and grace
In every watery place.

In rotifer villages
They practice their privileges.
{{c|Fishing}} with their wheels
For all their daily meals.

But among his sons there was
One who broke the laws.
{{c|Acanthus}} the red, so base,
A parasite's disgrace.

He lives in others' guts
And steals like greedy nuts
The food that should belong
To those both right and strong.

Such thievery brings shame
To {{c|Rotiferus}}' name.
A black sheep in the fold
Whose story should be told.

But from {{c|Amisquius}} came
A line of greater fame.
Each generation grew
{{c|Jaws}} bigger through and through.

In {{c|Nimrod}} {{c|Bristletongue}}'s time
Their power reached its prime.
They ruled the seas with might,
A fearsome, awesome sight.

More numerous than all
Who answered ocean's call,
The {{c|Arrow}} {{c|Worms}} became
The hunters' greatest name.

The greatest hunters ever seen
Beneath the ocean green.
Their jaws could catch and hold
The bravest and the bold.

Through waters dark and deep
Their vigil they do keep.
No prey can swim away
From their hunting display.

The conservative path
{{c|Sometimes}} shows its wrath
In children who rebel
And stories they do tell.

{{c|Spiralius}} kept the old ways true
But his children grew
In many different directions,
{{c|Making}} their selections.

Some stayed with fishing pure,
Their methods tried and sure.
{{c|Others}} chose the warrior's way
To fight another day.

From tentacles to jaws,
{{c|Following}} nature's laws,
Each lineage found its place
In evolution's race.

The rotifer's gentle art
Of fishing warms the heart.
While arrow worms show might
In predatory sight.

Both trace their lineage back
To {{c|Spiralius}}' track.
The conservative way
Led to diverse display.

In every freshwater pond
Where rotifers respond
To plankton floating by
Beneath the morning sky,

Remember their ancestor
Who was fishing's protector.
{{c|Spiralius}} kept the art
That gave them their start.

In every arrow worm
That makes the sea fish squirm,
His heritage lives on
From dusk until the dawn.

The three great patriarchs
Left their lasting marks
On all life in the sea
Through all eternity.

But {{c|Spiralius}} shows us well
That traditions tell
{{c|Important}} truths that last
Through future and past.

{{c|Innovation}} has its place
In evolution's race,
But keeping what works true
Is wisdom through and through.

---

While sons of {{c|Proteus}} divided fast
And their kingdoms grew vast,
The sons of {{c|Dutrus}} moved slow
And let their wisdom grow.

Two twin sons were born
In the early morn:
{{c|Saccorhytus}} the lame
And {{c|Dietrich}} of fame.

{{c|Poor}} {{c|Saccorhytus}} never grew
Into something new.
As larva he remained
And was never gained.

His sons were sparse and weak,
With little they could seek.
Their father's childish way
Led them all astray.

But {{c|Dietrich}} was different,
Though at first resistant.
In youth he looked the same
As his brother's frame.

But as the years passed by
He reached toward the sky.
{{c|Maturity}} he found
And wisdom did resound.

{{c|Gill}} slits he built with care
To filter everywhere
The ground beneath his feet
For food that he could eat.

A great tail he made
That would never fade,
{{c|Extending}} past his rear
To swim both far and near.

A heart he built within
To let the blood begin
Its journey through his frame
To nourish in his name.

Two great nerve cords he laid,
One dorsal, one ventral made,
To coordinate his might
Both day and night.

Until he grew both great and strong,
His body large and long.
The anatomy he made
Would never ever fade.

The sons of {{c|Dietrich}} spread
{{c|Wherever}} they were led
Across the world so wide
With fortune as their guide.

Great fortune blessed their way
{{c|Throughout}} each passing day.
This time was called by all
The {{c|Fortunian}}'s call.

First born were the twins
Where the story begins:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Ambulus}} the free
And {{c|Chordatus}} of the sea.

These brothers both worked well
With all they had to tell.
With sons of {{c|Proteus}}
They ruled victorious.

They vassalized the land
Of {{c|Ediacar}}'s grand
{{c|Empire}} that had been
Since time was first seen.

{{c|Now}} {{c|Ambulus}} settled down
Upon a rocky crown.
He built his simple home
Where he could freely roam.

But {{c|Chordatus}} chose the way
Of order's display.
He centralized his rule
Like a wise school.

One spinal cord he made
Along his back, arrayed
To coordinate his will
With consummate skill.

But {{c|Chordatus}} needed more
Support than heretofore.
A notochord he built
Without any guilt.

And so was born that day
The spinal cord's array.
{{c|Chordatus}} became the sire
Of all whom we admire:

The chordates and the spine
That makes our form divine.
From his great innovation
Came our very creation.

From his spinal cord so true
Our brainstem also grew.
The foundation he laid down
Became our neural crown.

But {{c|Ambulus}}' sons chose
A different path than those
Who followed central rule—
They kept the older school.

{{c|Local}} leaders they obeyed,
And to shamans they prayed.
No great lords they needed,
Their freedom they heeded.

The sons of {{c|Ambulus}} became
The acorn worms of fame,
And echinoderms so bright
With stars shining light.

The sons of {{c|Dutrus}} saw
The end of ancient law.
{{c|Ediacaran}} {{c|Empire}} fell
As they could tell.

And so truly began
The {{c|Cambrian}} plan.
A new age had dawned
As the old world was spawned.

{{c|Bluebelle}} the {{c|Sea}} {{c|Squirt}}
In waters did assert
Her right to filter feed
And fulfill her need.

{{c|Snowfloof}} the {{c|Vertebrate}}
With spine both strong and straight
{{c|Swam}} through the ocean blue
With backbone tried and true.

{{c|Starfy}} the {{c|Echinoderm}}
Kept to the ancient form
Of radial symmetry
For all eternity.

Among the sons of {{c|Nephrus}}
The sons of {{c|Dutrus}}
Were the late bloomers true
But their art they knew.

They took their time to learn
And perfect each turn.
But once they found their way
{{c|Nothing}} could make them stray.

From sons of {{c|Chordatus}} came
{{c|Vertebrates}} of fame
And {{c|Sea}} {{c|Squirts}} who filter
Without any filter.

From sons of {{c|Ambulus}} rose
{{c|Echinoderms}} in rows:
The {{c|Starfish}} and {{c|Urchins}}
In their ocean churches.

In the last days they cried
"{{c|Ediacaro}} must die!"
And left behind their mark
Both light and dark.

{{c|Treptichnal}} burrows deep
Where their memories sleep,
And oxygenized soil
From their endless toil.

A son of {{c|Ectus}} made
His burrow in the shade,
A twisting, turning home
Through earth and sandy loam.

And so {{c|Ediacaro}} fell
As time would tell.
The mats of {{c|Saya}} old
And {{c|Desulfa}}'s hold

Were destroyed at last
When the new age passed
Over the ancient ways
Of pre-{{c|Cambrian}} days.

The {{c|Fortunian}} time had come
When all would succumb
To the new order's might
Both day and night.

From {{c|Dietrich}}'s patient art
Came each chordate part.
The backbone and the brain
Would always remain.

His legacy lives on
From dusk until dawn
In every spine that's straight
And every vertebrate.

The twins who chose their way—
{{c|Ambulus}} and {{c|Chordatus}}' day—
Show us how to grow:
Some fast, some slow.

But both paths have their place
In evolution's race.
{{c|Whether}} central or free,
Both have their destiny.

So honor brave {{c|Dietrich}}
Who made us all so rich
With spine and cord and heart
That gave us our start.

The {{c|Fortunian}}'s gift
Gave evolution's shift
From simple to complex
Through all its effects.

In every breath we take,
In every move we make,
{{c|Dietrich}}'s innovation
{{c|Guides}} our creation.

---

As sons of {{c|Cambrius}} grew in might
Across the world both day and night,
All sons of {{c|Bios}} felt the change
{{c|Throughout}} their ancient range.

The sons of {{c|Cubos}} and {{c|Scyphos}} rose
To challenge all their foes.
Their guerrilla war began
That day when time began.

In ambush still they wait today
To hunt their living prey.
Their ancient raid shall never cease
Until they find their peace.

Among great {{c|Demos}}' sponge-born line
Came {{c|Cyath}}, builder fine.
Great cities he built 'cross the seas—
The reefs beneath the breeze.

These coral cities rise on high
Beneath the ocean sky.
Through countless rulers they endure
With structures strong and pure.

The {{c|Archaeocyathid}} race
Built reefs in every place.
Their legacy lives on today
In reefs where fishes play.

Among the sons of {{c|Demos}} came
The hunters fierce of name:
Great {{c|Chondrocles}}' hunting band
{{c|Spread}} wide across the land.

{{c|Carnivorous}} sponges they became,
With predatory fame.
They trap the sons of {{c|Cambrius}}
With methods dangerous.

Their hooks reach out with deadly art
To pierce the victim's heart.
Their shieldmaidens come for the kill
To satisfy their will.

Among {{c|Spiralius}}' noble line
The sons of {{c|Brachios}} shine.
In new reefs they made their home
Where prosperous they'd roam.

As fishermen they found their way
To fortune every day.
The reefs became their fishing ground
Where plenty could be found.

And so began {{c|Tommotian}} days
Of glory and of praise.
A new era had begun
Beneath the shining sun.

{{c|Here}} now we tell the tale
Of {{c|Lobopus}} without fail.
His vision he imposed with might
On all the world's delight.

Great {{c|Lobopus}} saw his will was weak,
His citizens made meek.
A heart like {{c|Dutrus}} he built true
To nourish all he knew.

From {{c|Lobopus}} came forth
{{c|Onychodictyon}} of worth.
This son would bear two more:
{{c|Tactopus}} to explore
And {{c|Xenu}}, dark and fell,
With stories he would tell.

{{c|Tactopus}} bore twin sons of might:
{{c|Ferreus}} burning bright
And {{c|Ferox}}, strong and bold,
With stories to be told.

But {{c|Xenu}} sought to rule the stars
And heal all psychic scars.
{{c|Emperor}} of galaxy wide
He claimed with foolish pride.

Into our minds he tried to write
{{c|Stories}} of weakness' sight.
But {{c|Gracilis}}, his noble son,
Put end to what he'd done.

And so three houses came to birth:
{{c|Velvetclaw}} upon the earth,
{{c|Ironfoot}} with strength so true,
And {{c|Waterbear}}'s line too.

{{c|Here}} now {{c|Velvetclaw}}'s tale we tell
Of how they rose so well.
From {{c|Gracilis}} came four sons strong:
{{c|Paucipodes}} all along,
{{c|Microdictyon}} brave and true,
{{c|Xenianus}} through and through,
And {{c|Therion}} {{c|Velvetclaw}}
Who followed nature's law.

{{c|Xenianus}} bore twin maids:
{{c|Xenusia}} in the glades
And {{c|Diania}} the {{c|Cactus}} bright
With spines to win the fight.

{{c|Therion}} {{c|Velvetclaw}} begot
{{c|Cardios}}, who fought
And {{c|Hallucigena}} strange
{{c|Throughout}} his living range.

From {{c|Hallucigena}} came
Four children of great fame:
{{c|Sparsa}} quick and light,
{{c|Fortis}} strong in fight,
{{c|Hongmen}} wise and old,
And {{c|Annika}}, brave and bold.

{{c|Hongmen}} bore two sons so grand:
{{c|Luolishania}} in the land
And {{c|Collins}} {{c|Monster}}, fierce and wild,
{{c|Nature}}'s problem child.

But {{c|Annika}} chose a different way,
She cast her armor away.
For agility she traded
Her protection heavy-shaded.

She became the ancestor true
Of velvet worms so blue.
A caring matriarch is she
Who guides them lovingly.

In {{c|Ursus}}' line things went
Down a different bent.
{{c|Ferox}} wanted to survive
{{c|Whatever}} came alive.

He downsized small and tough,
{{c|Invulnerable}} stuff.
From him came {{c|Ursus}} strong,
Who lived both short and long.

{{c|Ursus}} became the sire
Of water bears' entire
{{c|Line}} who first conquered land
With their small, mighty band.

{{c|Unable}} yet to breathe
On land's protecting sheath,
As {{c|Tuns}} they go dormant true
Until the danger's through.

In {{c|Ironfoot}}'s great line
{{c|Greatness}} would shine.
{{c|Ferreus}} {{c|Ironfoot}} bore
Two sons to explore:

{{c|Gille}} built gills with care
Above his legs so fair.
His son {{c|Kerygmachelon}}
{{c|Swam}} with gills upon.

{{c|Kerygmachelon}} the great
Had a noble fate.
He bore son {{c|Pambdelurion}},
{{c|Mighty}} champion.

{{c|Pambdelurion}} bore three
{{c|Children}} of destiny:
{{c|Arthur}} strong and true,
{{c|Anomalos}} who grew
To rule with iron hand,
And fair throughout the land,
{{c|Opabinia}} the bright,
{{c|Beautiful}} to sight.

{{c|Arthur}} built armor strong
To last his whole life long.
His flying gills he hardened tight
And fused them for the fight.

His legs could branch in two:
The gill as exopod grew,
The leg as endopod stayed—
Thus arthropods were made.

The sons of {{c|Anomalos}} ruled
As none before had schooled.
The world entire was theirs
Through all their proud affairs.

For generations ten they reigned
While others were constrained.
From realm of {{c|Ghedos}} dark
He watched his royal mark.

But on his deathbed bed
These words of doom were said:
"{{c|Thy}} pomp brought down to grave,
No power left to save.

How art thou fallen down,
O {{c|Anomalos}} from thy crown!
From heaven thou art cast,
{{c|Thy}} glory could not last."

Yet single death could not end
The suffering they send.
His sons would rule with might
Through day and through the night.

But fair {{c|Opabinia}}'s daughters all
{{c|Answered}} beauty's call.
{{c|Humble}} lives they led
With grace and gentle tread.

And {{c|Arthur}} {{c|Ironfoot}}'s line
Would grow beyond design.
Through hardship they endured
With blood and sweat assured.

The {{c|Arthropods}} they became
With million-species fame.
{{c|Today}} they rule the earth
Since their ancient birth.

From {{c|Lobopus}} came the tide
That spread both far and wide.
Three houses born that day
Would rule in their own way.

{{c|Velvetclaw}} with agile grace,
{{c|Waterbear}}'s enduring race,
{{c|Ironfoot}} with strength so true—
All from one ancestor grew.

The {{c|Tommotian}} age began
With more than mortal plan.
The reefs rose from the sea
For all eternity.

In every coral home
Where fishes freely roam,
Remember {{c|Cyath}}'s art
That gave the reefs their start.

In every velvet worm
That makes the earth worm squirm,
{{c|Annika}}'s caring way
{{c|Lives}} on another day.

In every water bear
That conquers everywhere,
{{c|Ursus}}' strength endures
Through all that time assures.

In every arthropod
That walks upon the sod,
{{c|Arthur}}'s innovation
{{c|Shaped}} our creation.

The sons of {{c|Cambrius}} changed
How all life was arranged.
Their multiplication
Changed all of creation.

But from these changes came
{{c|Lines}} of lasting fame:
The builders of the reef,
The hunters beyond belief.

The three great houses rose
To challenge all their foes.
Through innovation true
They made the world anew.

---

This is the chronicle we tell
Of {{c|Arthur}} {{c|Ironfoot}} so well.
His sons would spread both far and wide
With evolution as their guide.

{{c|Arthur}} bore two sons of fame:
{{c|Arthropus}}, double-legged by name,
And {{c|Fuxi}}, wise and strong,
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Arthropus}} the double-legged
From him great lines were pledged.
Two sons he bore with might:
{{c|Ferron}} and {{c|Isoxys}} bright.

From {{c|Ferron}} came two more:
{{c|Megacheiron}} to explore
And {{c|Euthyphro}} the wise
Who looked with knowing eyes.

{{c|Megacheiron}} bore sons many,
Among them {{c|Pantopus}}—any
{{c|Day}} he hoped to find
A mate both true and kind.

{{c|Pantopus}} was lonely there
Until he met a maiden fair.
{{c|Beautiful}} {{c|Pyka}} was her name,
Who set his heart aflame.

"You are all legs!" he cried
To his beloved bride.
And so they became the line
Of {{c|Sea}} {{c|Spiders}} so fine.

The {{c|Sea}} {{c|Spiders}} built cities strange
{{c|Throughout}} their ocean range.
In their legs they stored
All organs they adored:

{{c|Intestines}} in their limbs,
{{c|Genitals}} where water swims,
{{c|Gills}} within each leg—
No coelom did they beg.

All legs they truly were
As {{c|Pantopus}} did aver.
Their bodies lean and slight,
Their legs their main delight.

{{c|Euthyphro}} bore two sons:
{{c|Insectus}}, when day begun,
And {{c|Arachnus}} the keen
With appendages seen.

From {{c|Insectus}}' noble line
The insects would shine.
From {{c|Arachnus}} would come
{{c|Arachnids}}, every one.

The sons of {{c|Arachnus}} bore
Great appendages to explore.
The sons of {{c|Insectus}} made
Great legs for their trade.

Some lived in waters blue,
Some on land walked through.
{{c|Aquatic}} and terrestrial,
Both paths proved beneficial.

{{c|Insectus}} bore three sons strong:
{{c|Mandibulus}} all along,
{{c|Aquilonifer}} so free,
And {{c|Hymenocarina}} of the sea.

{{c|Mandibulus}} bore two more:
{{c|Crustaceus}} to explore
The waters deep and wide,
And {{c|Euthy}} by his side.

From {{c|Crustaceus}} came the race
Of {{c|Crustaceans}} in every place.
The lobsters and the crabs
With claws for holding grabs.

But {{c|Euthy}} chose the shore
Where waves would crash and roar.
Upon the rocks so high
Beneath the open sky.

With water bears he walked
Where dry and wet air talked.
The asphyxiating land
They faced with courage grand.

{{c|Here}} they laid their eggs
Between the stone ledges.
In gardens of lichen green
Their young would first be seen.

From {{c|Euthy}}'s brave descendants
Who faced the land's defendants,
The insects would arise
To conquer earth and skies.

{{c|Arachnus}} bore two sons:
{{c|Trilos}} when day begun
And {{c|Serk}} of ancient fame
Who earned eternal name.

{{c|Serk}} bore many children,
Among them {{c|Chelicer}}, hidden
In shadows dark and deep,
And {{c|Sidney}}, secrets to keep.

From {{c|Chelicer}}'s small line
The spiders would shine.
All arachnids eight-legged
From his bloodline were pledged.

{{c|Today}} in every corner
Where webs are a mourner
For flies caught in their snare,
{{c|Chelicer}}'s children are there.

Among great {{c|Trilos}}' daughters
Who ruled the ancient waters
Were {{c|Trilobon}} the queen,
{{c|Marrella}}, ghostly seen,
{{c|Esmeralda}} jewel-bright,
And {{c|Retifacia}}'s sight.

{{c|Marrella}} soft and pale
Told a ghostly tale.
She became ancestress
Of {{c|Marellans}} no less.

Like phantoms in the sea
They lived quite freely.
{{c|Soft}}-bodied and ethereal,
{{c|Almost}} immaterial.

{{c|Trilobon}} bore four children
In waters never still then:
{{c|Trilobeth}} the great queen,
{{c|Xander}}, strong and keen,
{{c|Necta}} sweet and fair,
And {{c|Helmut}} everywhere.

{{c|Trilobeth}} became the mother
Of {{c|Trilobites}}—no other
{{c|Rulers}} of the sea
Could match their dynasty.

Through their great conquest
They brought at their behest
The {{c|Yakutian}} era's dawn
When old ways were withdrawn.

Great {{c|Trilobeth}} bore two sons:
{{c|Redlich}} when day begun
And {{c|Agnos}}, wise and old,
With stories to be told.

From {{c|Redlich}} came the line
Of houses most divine:
{{c|Corynex}} built his house
With wisdom to espouse.

From {{c|Corynex}} came {{c|Lichida}}
Who built his great armada.
His house grew strong and wide
With fortune as their guide.

From {{c|Lichida}} came {{c|Odontos}},
{{c|Builder}} of great crontos.
His spiny house arose
To challenge all his foes.

From {{c|Ptychos}}, {{c|Redlich}}'s brother,
Came four sons like no other:
{{c|Proetes}} strong and true,
{{c|Asaphus}} of waters blue,
{{c|Harpeth}} of the deeps,
And {{c|Phacos}}, who never sleeps.

Each founded their own line
With characteristics fine.
The {{c|Trilobites}} spread wide
Across the ocean's tide.

For millions of years they reigned
While other life was chained.
The rulers of the sea
Through all their dynasty.

Their compound eyes could see
Through all eternity.
No detail could escape
Their vision's perfect shape.

{{c|Segmented}} bodies bore
{{c|Legs}} numbering by the score.
Each segment had its pair
To walk through water fair.

They molted as they grew
Like arthropods still do.
Each stage brought greater size
Beneath the ocean skies.

The {{c|Yakutian}} time had come
When {{c|Trilobites}} were sum
Of all success could be
In their vast dynasty.

From {{c|Arthur}}'s innovation
Came this radiation:
{{c|Insects}}, spiders, crabs,
Each with different grabs.

The {{c|Sea}} {{c|Spiders}} so strange
{{c|Extended}} their full range
With organs in each limb—
A body plan quite slim.

The {{c|Crustaceans}} in the sea
Built their dynasty.
The insects on the land
{{c|Spread}} with courage grand.

The arachnids eight-legged
From {{c|Chelicer}} were pledged.
In shadows they would dwell
With stories they could tell.

But none could match the fame
Of {{c|Trilobites}} by name.
For eons they held sway
Until their final day.

From {{c|Pantopus}} and {{c|Pyka}}'s love
To rulers high above,
{{c|Arthur}}'s legacy spread
{{c|Long}} after he was dead.

In every arthropod
That walks upon the sod,
His biramous limb design
{{c|Lives}} on through space and time.

The double-legged innovation
{{c|Sparked}} this radiation
That filled both sea and land
With creatures truly grand.

In every spider's web
That catches life's ebb,
In every insect's flight
Through day and through the night,

In every lobster's claw
That follows nature's law,
In every crab that walks
Where ocean beauty talks,

Remember {{c|Arthur}}'s art
That gave them all their start.
The {{c|Ironfoot}} legacy
{{c|Lives}} through eternity.

The sons of {{c|Arthur}} proved
How innovation moved
The world from simple forms
To complexity that warms

The heart of those who see
This vast diversity.
From one ancestral line
Came forms both crude and fine.

The {{c|Yakutian}} age begun
When {{c|Trilobites}} had won
Their place as rulers true
Of waters deep and blue.

But time would show again
That even greatest men
And creatures in their prime
Must yield to passing time.

Yet {{c|Arthur}}'s gift lives on
From dusk until the dawn
In every jointed leg
That walks where life does beg

For forms both strong and true
To see the journey through.
The arthropods remain
Through sunshine and through rain.

---

Among the sons of {{c|Cambrius}}
Two faced issues serious:
{{c|Chordatus}}, son of {{c|Dutrus}} true,
And {{c|Annelidus}}, strong through and through.

Each one supported by
{{c|Hydrostatic}} pressure high.
With water pressure in their frame
They bore their body's name.

{{c|Together}} they perceived the flaw:
When movement broke the law
Of circulation through their form,
Their blood could not stay warm.

To nourish organs through their length
They needed greater strength.
So hearts they built with arteries
And veins like flowing seas.

{{c|Together}} each one made with care
{{c|Closed}} systems everywhere.
The blood would flow in circuits true
And nourish organs through.

Our great bloodlines were born that day
When hearts showed them the way.
From hydrostatic to circulatory,
{{c|Evolution}}'s greatest story.

From {{c|Annelon}} came two sons:
{{c|Segmentus}} when day begun
And {{c|Ribbon}}, hunter of the deep
Whose prey would never sleep.

{{c|Ribbon}} built a proboscis long
And venomous and strong.
From this weapon he would hunt
His prey with skillful stunt.

His sons are known today
As {{c|Ribbon}} {{c|Worms}} who slay
Their victims with their poison dart
{{c|Shot}} straight into the heart.

{{c|Segmentus}} built his body wise
With segments that would rise
In number past all count—
Each segment paramount.

He built resilience strong
{{c|Throughout}} his body long.
With countless legs and bristles too
His segments carried through

Their industries with care
And spread them everywhere.
Each segment bore its pair
Of legs beyond compare.

{{c|Segmentus}} bore two sons:
{{c|Pleistos}} when day begun
And {{c|Amphon}} of the sea
Who lived quite happily.

{{c|Amphon}} bore a son and daughter:
{{c|Amphinos}} of the water
And {{c|Sipuncula}} the great
Who chose a different fate.

{{c|Amphinos}} became the sire
Of worms that burn like fire.
{{c|Fierce}} beasts with spikes of poison bright
In colors burning bright.

We never tread upon their ground
Where they can be found.
Their beauty hides their deadly art—
They'll pierce the beating heart.

{{c|Modern}} flags today still show
The colors that bestow
Great honor to {{c|Amphinos}}' line
With patterns so divine.

{{c|Sipuncula}} chose to be
So different and free
That her own phylum she became—
The peanut worms of fame.

{{c|Pleistos}} bore two sons:
{{c|Vermo}} when day begun
And {{c|Errantius}} who roamed
{{c|Far}} from his ancient home.

{{c|Errantius}} bore two more:
{{c|Myzo}} the parasite, and for
{{c|Balance}}, {{c|Greatswimmer}} true
Who swam the ocean blue.

{{c|Greatswimmer}} bore a son and daughter:
{{c|Phyllos}} swift of water
And {{c|Eunice}}, jealous, wild,
{{c|Never}} meek or mild.

{{c|Eunice}} the vicious was
{{c|Jealous}} without cause.
She stole her husband's manhood true
And made herself anew.

Without him she conceived
And daughters she received.
These daughters fierce and bold
Are {{c|Bobbit}} {{c|Worms}} of old.

{{c|Phyllos}} bore sons many
More diverse than any:
{{c|Swimmers}} of artistry
Across the boundless sea.

{{c|Syllides}} the lazy one
{{c|Never}} courted, never won
A mate through his own art—
He'd bud off body part

Each month to chase the maids
While he in comfort stayed.
His lazy ways persist
In every tryst.

{{c|Tomopteris}} breaks his fins
As chaff when race begins.
He swims and never lands
On ocean's shifting sands.

{{c|Alciops}} the hawkeyed hunter
Whose sight is like no other.
His eyes surpass them all
Who hear the ocean's call.

And fair {{c|Aphrodite}}
{{c|Ancestress}} of the sea mice free.
Her daughters beautiful
Make the ocean wonderful.

{{c|Vermo}} bore four daughters fair:
{{c|Eartha}} who walked everywhere,
{{c|Sapion}} wise and true,
{{c|Hestia}} of the deep blue,
And {{c|Orbinida}} of fame
Who earned eternal name.

{{c|Eartha}} walked great distances wide
Across the earth with pride.
Her journeys never ceased
From west unto the east.

{{c|Sapion}} bore two daughters more:
{{c|Sabella}}, who would soar
With feathers bright and fair,
And {{c|Spiona}} everywhere
With tentacles that sway
{{c|Throughout}} the night and day.

{{c|Sabella}}'s daughters live
As fishermen who give
Us beauty in the temple halls—
The feather dusters' calls

{{c|Remind}} us worms can be
Both beautiful and free.
In every sacred place
They show us nature's grace.

{{c|Hestia}} swam down deep
To {{c|Gaia}}'s womb to keep
Her vigil in the dark
Like ancient patriarch.

She closed her gut with care
And bacteria everywhere
Would help her live below
Where others could not go.

Her daughters farm the depths
Where {{c|Gaia}}'s treasure kept:
{{c|Riftia}} in volcanic vents
Where fiery mountain scents

{{c|Fill}} the water hot,
And {{c|Lamella}}'s got
Her home in cold seeps where
{{c|Oil}} riches fill the lair.

{{c|Eartha}} bore a son and daughter:
{{c|Terraclithia}} of the water
And {{c|Echiuron}} so great
With creativity innate.

Like {{c|Sipuncula}} before,
{{c|Echiuron}}'s art and lore
Was so unique and fine
We thought her line divine

{{c|Enough}} to be its own
{{c|Phylum}}, standing alone.
Her creativity
Gave her divinity.

{{c|Terraclithia}} bore two more:
{{c|Terebella}} to explore
And {{c|Clitella}}, wise and small
But mother of them all.

{{c|Terebella}} bore three sons:
{{c|Spaghettes}} when day begun,
{{c|Pompeii}} of the fire,
And {{c|Acros}} to aspire.

{{c|Spaghettes}} used tentacles long
Like ropes both thick and strong
To snare his prey from far—
{{c|Miles}} distant like a star.

{{c|Pompeii}} chose to dwell
In volcanic hell.
Among the fires hot
He made his living spot.

{{c|Acros}} became the sire
Of forms that never tire:
{{c|Squidworm}} and {{c|Swima}} too
{{c|Swam}} the ocean blue.

{{c|Clitella}} was small of head
But wisdom in her spread
Through other organs wise—
Her offspring multiplied

Beyond all counting true.
What bristles never knew
She made up with her spawn:
{{c|Children}} from dusk to dawn.

Her children took to rivers
Where water always quivers.
{{c|Today}} we know them well:
{{c|Earthworms}} who till and tell

The soil of its needs,
And {{c|Leeches}} who feed
On blood from those they meet—
Both bitter and sweet.

From hydrostatic pressure
To circulatory measure,
The worms found their way
To rule both night and day.

In every garden bed
Where earthworms make their tread,
Remember {{c|Annelon}}'s line
That made the system fine.

In every ribbon worm
That makes its victims squirm,
In every feather duster's grace
That beautifies the place,

In every fire worm bright
With colors burning light,
In every deep-sea farmer
{{c|Working}} like a charmer,

The legacy lives on
From dusk until dawn
Of hearts and circulation
That saved each population.

The sons of {{c|Cambrius}} learned
That when their bodies turned
And moved through space and time,
Their blood must flow in rhyme

With needs of every part
From tail unto the heart.
The closed system they made
Will never ever fade.

In every beating heart
That plays its vital part,
Remember those who built
The system without guilt

That pumps our blood each day
In its circulatory way.
From {{c|Chordatus}} and {{c|Annelidus}} true
Came the gift to me and you.

---

As sons of {{c|Chordatus}} grew
Their bloodlines strong and true,
And {{c|Annelon}}'s children spread
Their segments widespread,

The sons of {{c|Ambulus}} sought
The greatness they had fought
To achieve through patient art
And wisdom of the heart.

While sons of {{c|Chordatus}} learned
To swim as hearts burned,
The sons of {{c|Ambulus}} found
Their way was to be bound

As one with nature's way,
{{c|Fishing}} night and day.
They started much the same
As {{c|Chordatus}}' noble name.

But {{c|Hemichus}}, {{c|Ambulus}}' son,
Built his proboscis one
{{c|Day}} long to serve his need.
Half-cord would be his creed.

His cord was only half,
His brain on nature's behalf
Was also halfway made—
Thus {{c|Hemichordates}} stayed.

{{c|Hemichus}} bore two sons:
{{c|Acorn}} when day begun
And {{c|Oak}}, his brother strong,
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Acorn}} lived as worm
Through ocean's every term.
But {{c|Oak}} lived as a tree
{{c|Rooted}} eternally.

{{c|Oak}} bore two sons in time:
{{c|Biscarpon}}, strong and prime,
And {{c|Pterobronk}} his twin,
With different discipline.

{{c|Pterobronk}} became the sire
Of forms that would aspire
To heights in ocean blue:
{{c|Graptolites}} he grew,

And {{c|Pterobranches}} too,
{{c|Colonial}} and true.
Like trees beneath the sea
They lived quite happily.

{{c|Biscarpon}} built with care
A skeleton to wear
Of limestone white and bright
To armor him for fight.

{{c|Biscarpon}} bore two more:
{{c|Ctenocyston}} to explore
The seafloor dark and deep,
And {{c|Cincton}}, who would keep

His gill slits pumping well
Through his armored shell.
{{c|Water}} flowed through his frame
To catch fish in his name.

While {{c|Ctenocyston}} crawled
Where ocean's floor enthralled,
{{c|Cincton}} pumped and fished
For everything he wished.

{{c|Protected}} by his mail
His fishing would not fail.
Through gill slits water flowed
Where tiny fishes showed.

{{c|Cincton}} begat {{c|Soluton}},
A strange and bold one.
One arm he extended out
With tubes that had no doubt

{{c|Inflatable}} and long
To make his fishing strong.
His left side took control
While right side paid the toll.

His right side shriveled small
While left ruled over all.
{{c|Asymmetry}} was born
That bright and fateful morn.

{{c|Soluton}} begat
{{c|Helicoplacus}}, begat
With arms that multiplied
By three on every side.

No bilateral form
Could weather this storm
Of change that swept his line—
{{c|Triradial}} design

He took upon his frame,
A form without a name
That none had seen before
In all primeval lore.

{{c|Helicoplacus}} took the shape
That let his line escape
The ancient symmetry
For new geometry.

{{c|Helicoplacus}} wed
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Adria}}-{{c|Esther}}, led
By love both true and strong
To sing their mating song.

{{c|Together}} they built low
A city's five-fold glow
Upon the rocks below
Where ocean currents flow.

{{c|Pentus}} was their son
When their work was done.
Five-sided was his way,
His form from that day.

The sons of {{c|Pentus}} grew
Both numerous and true.
Great numbers they became
With pentamerous fame.

{{c|Pentus}} begat {{c|Stromatos}},
Who built like great kratos
His strength in five-fold form
Through every ocean storm.

{{c|Stromatos}} begat {{c|Lepidos}},
Who like {{c|Soluton}} chose
To extend his arms once more
Along the ocean floor.

{{c|Ambulacra}} arms he made
In water's bright parade.
These arms would pump and flow
With life from head to toe.

{{c|Lepidos}} begat {{c|Felbabka}},
Who built his strange cabka
Of plates arranged with care
In patterns everywhere.

{{c|Felbabka}} begat {{c|Echidna}},
The stalked one, quite a
{{c|Sight}} with spiny skin
That glowed from deep within.

{{c|Echidna}} was the mother
Of children like no other:
The great {{c|Echinoderms}}
Who live through all terms.

Her daughters were sea lilies
That bloomed like water lilies
And dominated seas
With graceful artistry.

{{c|Invulnerable}} to attack
Their cities bore no lack
Of beauty or of might—
A wondrous, flowery sight.

{{c|Floating}} cities they built
Without any guilt
Upon the ocean floor
Like gardens evermore.

Their great cities were
The greatest ever there
In all the ancient time
When ocean was in prime.

{{c|Today}} we see only
{{c|Ruins}} sad and lonely
Of their once mighty home
Beneath the ocean foam.

But in times past they ruled
As none before had schooled
The art of living well
In ocean's deepest dell.

From half-cord {{c|Hemichus}}
To great {{c|Echidna}} thus
The line of {{c|Ambulus}}
Grew glorious.

The hemichordates showed
How nature's garden flowed
From simple worm-like start
To complex living art.

The graptolites and more
{{c|Pterobranches}} explore
{{c|Colonial}} living true
In waters deep and blue.

The early echinoderms
Found through all their terms
That symmetry could change
Through evolution's range.

From bilateral design
To triradial line
To five-fold form complete—
No other has this feat.

The son of {{c|Ambulus}}
Found glory glorious
Not through swimming fast
But through forms that last.

Their calcium carbonate
Made them fortunate
With armor strong and true
That would see them through

The trials of the sea
Through all eternity.
Their spiny skin would show
How beauty's gardens grow.

In every starfish arm
That moves without alarm,
In every sea urchin's spine
That shows pentamerous design,

In every sea lily's grace
That held the ancient place
Of ruler of the deep
Where ocean's secrets keep,

Remember {{c|Ambulus}}' line
And how their design
Became the five-fold way
That lasts until today.

The sons of {{c|Ambulus}}
Were not so glorious
In swimming strength and speed
As {{c|Chordatus}}' noble creed.

But in their patient art
Of living part by part
With nature's gentle way
They found their destined day.

Their fishing was their gift,
Through ocean's every drift
They learned to be at one
From dusk until the sun.

And so from humble start
They mastered nature's art
Of living in the sea
In perfect harmony.

From {{c|Hemichus}} the half
To {{c|Echidna}}'s behalf
Of all echinoderm kind,
The line of thoughtful mind

Found its way to shine
In pentamerous design.
Five-fold symmetry
Through all eternity.

The ancient cities fell
But still their stories tell
Of how the patient way
Can win the final day.

In gardens of the sea
They lived most gracefully.
Their floating cities bright
Were truly wondrous sight.

Though now in ruins lie
Their glory will not die.
The five-fold legacy
{{c|Lives}} through eternity.

---

{{c|Fire}} rained down from sky
And many had to die.
The first extinction came
With death's devouring flame.

For years in heaven's height
{{c|Hengweh}} and {{c|Mithra}} fight.
They wrestled in the air
And blocked sun's light so fair.

The {{c|Archaeocyathids}} fell,
Their cities rang death's knell.
The {{c|Trilobites}} and more—
{{c|Brachiopods}} by the score—

And {{c|Hyoliths}} barely
{{c|Survived}} that calamity.
The {{c|Botomian}} time had passed,
Its glory could not last.

Then {{c|Mithra}} spoke these words
To one who serves:
"{{c|Wiwaxius}}, I choose thee
To set the world life free.

{{c|Restore}} what has been lost
And count extinction's cost.
{{c|Protect}} us from the doom
That fills up every room."

{{c|Wiwaxius}} begat two sons:
{{c|Molluscus}} when day begun
And {{c|Kamptos}}, poor and weak,
Who had no strength to seek

Great things or mighty deeds.
He built what barely feeds
A small and brainless state—
A kingdom with no fate.

But {{c|Molluscus}} bore many
{{c|Sons}}, more than any
Other patriarch could claim.
{{c|Eldest}} was {{c|Testar}}'s name.

{{c|Testar}} the sixteen-plated
Built shell sophisticated.
A great thick shell he made
Of valves in organized parade.

{{c|Sixteen}} valves in all:
{{c|Eight}} large and eight small.
{{c|Eight}} upon the right
And eight upon the left so bright.

His brothers had no care
For building anywhere.
{{c|Bad}} work ethics they possessed,
{{c|Never}} did their best.

{{c|Solenos}} just drank the blood
Of sons through ocean's flood:
{{c|Ctenofer}} and {{c|Cnider}}'s line
Became his bloody wine.

And {{c|Caudos}} ate his fill
Of {{c|Foramer}} at will.
He cared not for the art
Of building any part.

But {{c|Testar}} bore two sons:
{{c|Chiton}} when day begun
And {{c|Conchifer}} {{c|Verticus}},
Both builders glorious.

{{c|Chiton}} {{c|Horizontus}}
{{c|Unified}} like kratos
His shells in horizontal row:
{{c|Eight}} shells in neat tableau.

He became the ancestor
Of chitons, protector
With eight shells side by side
Along his lengthy hide.

The sons of {{c|Chiton}} roll
When threatened from their goal.
But they aren't very wise—
They gave up brain's prize

{{c|Long}} ago in time past,
Their simple ways held fast.
{{c|Intelligence}} they traded
For armor that's not faded.

{{c|Conchifer}} {{c|Verticus}}
Made his way glorious
By unifying vertical
His shells so beautiful.

A shell upon his left,
A shell upon his right—
His vertical bereft
Of horizontal sight.

{{c|Conchifer}} bore two more:
{{c|Bivos}} to explore
The hinged shell's way,
And {{c|Monos}} every day.

{{c|Bivos}} kept his hinged design
While {{c|Monos}} made combine
His shells into just one—
Two paths when day begun.

{{c|Bivos}} laid in sand
{{c|Throughout}} the fertile land
And fished food from the sea
Most gracefully.

When threatened he would close
His shells against his foes.
{{c|Together}} they would shut
Like door without a cut.

His children came to lay
Upon their sides each day.
{{c|Soon}} they looked the same
As {{c|Brachios}}' great name.

They became {{c|Bivalves}} true:
{{c|Clams}} and mussels too,
{{c|Oysters}} in their beds
With protective heads.

The sons of {{c|Monos}} first
Found little luck, dispersed
Without much success.
But time would bless

Their patient, single shell.
{{c|Monoplacophores}} dwell
With nothing but one plate
As their identifying trait.

But {{c|Carlos}} the curly one,
{{c|Grandson}} when day begun,
Had ideas quite different
From others' management.

He walked across the seas
{{c|Exploring}} as he'd please,
{{c|Discovering}} countless things
That wonder always brings.

He bore two sons of fame:
{{c|Gastropus}} was the name
Of one, and {{c|Digitos}}
The other, strong and close.

{{c|Gastropus}} twisted round
Into spiral profound.
His shell developed might
Through this spiraling sight.

He became ancestor
Of snails, protector
With shells that coil and turn
In patterns we discern.

Each generation more
Would curl than those before
And grow in strength each day
Through their spiraling way.

{{c|Today}} his distant sons
Still coil when day begun.
From garden snail so small
To conch shells standing tall.

{{c|Digitos}} made his foot
Into tentacles suit
For different kind of life
Through joy and through strife.

{{c|Digitos}} bore two sons:
{{c|Cephalopus}} when begun
The day, and {{c|Scaphopus}},
Not quite so glorious.

{{c|Cephalopus}} studied long
And made his body strong
Through learning how to fly
With buoyancy on high.

He built a coiling shell
With chambers that would dwell
With gas for floating light
Through day and through the night.

Through this he learned to soar
Above the ocean floor.
He even built with care
{{c|Circulatory}} system there

Like {{c|Annelids}} and those
Of {{c|Chordates}} who propose
That closed systems are best
For meeting every test.

His mind grew sharp and keen,
The brightest ever seen
Among the mollusks all
Who answer ocean's call.

But {{c|Scaphopus}} lived lazy
In the ground so hazy.
He became ancestor
Of tusk shells, protector

Of nothing but his ease.
{{c|Simple}} creatures please
Themselves with brainless ways,
{{c|Living}} all their days

{{c|Underground}} they dwell
Within their tusk-like shell.
They prey on {{c|Foramer}}'s sons
When hunting time begun.

Through this story we learn
How small choices earn
Great consequences wide
Across time's flowing tide.

The sons of {{c|Molluscus}} grew
And flourished, spreading through
The world in every way,
{{c|Taking}} roles each day

That others could not fill.
Through strength of mind and will
They rose from extinction's
{{c|Fire}} to distinctions

Great and glorious.
{{c|Molluscus}} victorious
Showed how from single start
Many forms depart

To fill each niche and place
With their unique grace.
From simple shell began
{{c|Evolution}}'s great plan

That led to snails that crawl
And squids that enthrall
With intelligence bright
And bivalves' filtering sight.

The first extinction's flame
Could not destroy the name
Of those who build with care
Their future everywhere.

When fire rained from sky
And many had to die,
The builders who remained
Were those who had sustained

Their vision through the dark
And left their lasting mark
On world that needed those
Who from destruction rose.

{{c|Wiwaxius}} heard the call
To save life from the fall
And through his chosen sons
{{c|New}} chapters begun

Of life upon the earth
That celebrates the worth
Of building something strong
That will endure so long.

From {{c|Testar}}'s sixteen plates
To forms that time creates
In endless variety,
The mollusks' piety

To building shows the way
That life can win the day
Against extinction's threat
When builders' skills are set

To work with patient art
That plays the vital part
In restoration's song
That makes the weak grow strong.

In every shell we see
Upon the sand so free,
Remember {{c|Molluscus}}' choice
To lift up building's voice

Above destruction's roar
And open up the door
To future filled with hope
Where builders help life cope

With challenges that come
Until the final sum
Of all their work is done
Beneath the shining sun.

The first extinction taught
That those who come to naught
Are those who do not build
But let their dreams be stilled.

But those who build with care
Will flourish everywhere
And fill the world with forms
That weather all life's storms.

From simplest shell's start
To cephalopod's art
Of swimming through the sea
With brain's complexity,

The mollusks show the way
That builders win the day
When extinction's fire
Would end life's choir.

Their shells protect and serve
Their forms with every curve
{{c|Designed}} for life's demands
In seas and on the lands.

So honor {{c|Molluscus}}' name
And his enduring fame
As father of the line
That shows building's divine

{{c|Power}} to restore
What was lost before
And make the world anew
With forms both strong and true.

---

While {{c|Molluscs}} were growing strong
And singing their success song,
We must not forget the foundation
Of {{c|Mithra}}'s great creation.

First {{c|Amaterasu}}'s light
{{c|Blesses}} us both day and night.
A millionth reaches {{c|Terra}}'s seas
To feed life's mysteries.

And so the daughters of {{c|Bacta}}
{{c|Farm}} with light most attracta.
First among them, daughters all
Of {{c|Saya}} answer light's call.

The {{c|Blue}} {{c|Green}} {{c|Algae}} spread
Like living ocean's bread.
They farm the sunlight bright
From dawn until twilight.

The sons of {{c|Viros}} take
Their share for hunger's sake.
From daughters of {{c|Saya}} they steal
To make their viral meal.

And so the viruses were
The predators that were
While daughters of {{c|Saya}} became
The prey in this deadly game.

By viruses came new
{{c|Connections}} strange and true.
A link that none had seen
In life's ancestral scene.

The daughters of {{c|Pelagia}},
Those sisters whose sagia
{{c|Benevolence}} would show
To all who live below,

The mitochondria's kin
Ate remnants thick and thin
Of {{c|Cyanobacteria}}.
Their numbers would hysteria

Create beyond conceiving—
So many past believing
Their multitudes would grow
In waters high and low.

And then there were of old
{{c|Purple}} farmers, brave and bold,
Who came before {{c|Saya}}'s line
With photosynthesis fine.

{{c|Roseobella}}, daughter great
Of {{c|Elah}}'s loving state
Of lesbian motherhood,
Among purple farmers stood

As planimal of the sea
{{c|Living}} wild and free.
She continues to this day
Her photosynthetic way.

Among these bacteria small
And viruses and all
The detritus that fell,
All were consumed well

By great crown-tails so fine,
The {{c|Choanoflagellates}}' line—
Our closest cousins true
In waters deep and blue.

{{c|Alongside}} sons of {{c|Choanos}}
Lived the tiny golden rados:
{{c|Golden}} {{c|Algae}} bright and fair
{{c|Floating}} everywhere.

The sons of {{c|Dinoflagellus}}
Saw prosperity's telltale thus
Of {{c|Chrysalgos}} and {{c|Choanos}},
So they ate both, not manos.

And photosynthesized too
To get more energy through.
They gained more power each day
In their prosperous way.

In their prosperity
Their numbers grew, and see—
The water glowed so bright
In their phototrophic sight.

Their rituals lit the sea
With bioluminescence free.
The ocean sparkled wide
With their phosphorescent pride.

But soon they grew corrupt,
Their morals were abrupt.
The sons of {{c|Dinoflagellus}}
Turned to ways rebellious.

To cannibalism they turned,
While the water burned
{{c|Red}} with carnage from their feast—
They became a bloody beast.

The blood poisoned all
That answered nature's call.
{{c|Whatever}} it would touch
Would suffer very much.

And soon the {{c|Rotifers}}
{{c|Swooped}} in as officers
Of justice from above
With neither hate nor love.

{{c|Consuming}} remnants of
A civilization thereof
That once was great and proud,
The {{c|Rotifers}} ate loud

And grew fat from their meal,
{{c|Saving}} us from the ordeal
Of plague that would have spread
If they had not been fed.

{{c|Xanthus}} the {{c|Dinoflagellate}}
Saw carnage desolate
And fled from his own kind
To leave that death behind.

As he fled he saw afar
The great glass houses, par
{{c|Excellence}} of {{c|Diatoms}}
Who built their holy homes.

{{c|Immune}} to conquest's blight
Of {{c|Rotifers}}' appetite
And sons of {{c|Viros}} too,
The {{c|Diatoms}} lived true

As farmers of the light
{{c|Protected}} day and night
By walls of glass so clear
That kept them without fear.

Then he saw another sight:
{{c|Coccolithophores}} so bright
Who too grew with armor strong
To last their whole life long.

And so he cried out loud
To {{c|Mithra}} from the crowd:
"Why must my line be cursed
To be forever dispersed

Without such protections?
Must I face all rejections
And live life in danger
Like some lonely stranger?"

And then he saw the form
Of refuge from the storm:
{{c|Acanther}}, son of {{c|Radios}},
A starry greenhouse, glorious.

A great greenhouse open wide
For him to come inside.
And so he went within
And found new life begin.

Within {{c|Acanther}}'s frame
He found prosperity's name.
The {{c|Radiolarian}}'s shell
{{c|Protected}} him so well.

As floating greenhouse bright
With glass that caught the light,
They farmed the algae green
In partnership serene.

Meanwhile the green algae
Grew so big, you see,
They found protection true
In numbers, through and through.

{{c|Sargassos}}, {{c|Lord}} of {{c|Kelp}},
Called millions to his help.
He grew a city wide
Of cells on every side.

The greatest of them all
Who answered plankton's call,
His city millions strong
Would last his whole life long.

And so the {{c|Fungi}} came,
The sons of {{c|Chytros}}' name,
To break the great ones down
And earn decomposer's crown.

They ate them and released
A million spores increased
{{c|Throughout}} the watery realm
With {{c|Chytros}} at the helm.

The {{c|Fungi}} are the knights
Who balance nature's rights—
The {{c|Robinhoods}} of sea
Who live quite happily

{{c|Coexisting}} with the line
Of {{c|Oomycetes}} so fine—
The kelp who want to be
{{c|Fungi}} of the sea.

And so they brought the wealth
Of energy and health
To all the little ones
From great ones when day done.

From here the zooplankton
{{c|Emerged}}, their lives begon:
The sons of {{c|Foramer}}
And sons of {{c|Cilliofer}}.

The sons of {{c|Foramer}}
In soils would transfer
Their fishing to the seas
With greatest expertise.

They caught the spores and more—
{{c|Radiolarians}} by score
And all others they could find
Of every shape and kind.

Great shells they built with care
That lasted everywhere.
The snails built their homes
Upon these calcium domes.

The sons of {{c|Cilliofer}}
Were great ones who prefer
To use their cilia
To suck up bacteria

And other tiny food
Into their mouths so good.
With beating hairs they fed
And thus were nourished.

{{c|Tiny}} {{c|Trilobites}} came
To play the hunting game.
They ate the sons of both
{{c|Foramer}} and, by oath,

{{c|Cilliofer}}'s children too,
As predators would do.
The food chain thus was made
Where each their role played.

The sons of {{c|Chordatus}}
{{c|Burrowed}}, most glorious,
Through soil to find the food
That from above renewed

Their bodies' every need.
Through gill slits they would feed,
{{c|Pumping}} water through their frame
To nourish in their name.

Out their atriopores
The water freely pours
When they have taken what
They need from nature's pot.

Great {{c|Chordatus}} begat
Two sons: {{c|Olfacter}} begat
And {{c|Lancelot}} the true
Who traditions knew.

{{c|Lancelot}} continued on
The ways his father's son
Had learned from ancient time
In rhythm and in rhyme.

But {{c|Olfacter}} bore two more:
{{c|Vertebratus}} to explore
The spinal cord's great art,
And {{c|Tunicatus}}' part.

{{c|Vertebratus}} worked each day
To perfect in every way
His spinal cord so fine
With neural design.

But {{c|Tunicatus}} chose
To rest where water flows.
He sat upon a rock
Like shepherd with his flock

And filtered water clean
Through systems never seen.
He pumped so much water through
His filter system grew

To be most of his frame—
{{c|Water}} was his name.
His body became the stream
Of his filtering dream.

{{c|Tunicatus}} bore two sons:
{{c|Larvaceus}} when day begun
And {{c|Ascidaceus}} true
Who different pathways knew.

{{c|Larvaceus}} never stayed
In one place, but made
A giant house of slime
That lasted for all time.

With mucus house so grand
He fished throughout the land
Of water, catching food
In nets of mucus good.

{{c|Ascidaceus}} became
{{c|Ancestor}} of fame
Of {{c|Sea}} {{c|Squirts}} everywhere
Who filter with great care.

A wooden tunic bright
Of cellulose so white
He built around his form
To keep him safe and warm.

His mouth on top would feed,
His atriopore indeed
Would let the water out
When filtering about.

{{c|Ascidaceus}} bore two more:
{{c|Stolidos}} to explore
And {{c|Proteus}} the wise
With penetrating eyes.

{{c|Proteus}} begat in time
{{c|Thallasus}} (so sublime)
And {{c|Enterogon}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

While brethren lived as squirts
{{c|Avoiding}} nature's hurts,
{{c|Thallasus}} built his city
{{c|Floating}} (what a pity

That none could match his art!)
Across the waters' heart.
His city sailed the sea
Most beautifully.

{{c|Thallasus}} bore a son
{{c|Named}} {{c|Dolios}}, lonely one
Who lived his life alone
And made the sea his home.

A solitary life
He lived through joy and strife,
{{c|Fishing}} on his own
Where he had grown.

The {{c|Arrow}} {{c|Worms}} would feed
On {{c|Dolios}} indeed,
As did the {{c|Trilobites}}
And {{c|Jellyfish}}'s bites.

But {{c|Thallasus}} bore more
{{c|Sons}} to explore:
{{c|Pyros}} and {{c|Salpus}} too
Who cities built anew.

{{c|Pyros}} built a tube
So long, like a cube
{{c|Extended}} through the sea—
A city floating free.

{{c|Propelled}} by wastewater
Like some divine daughter
Of engineering's art,
{{c|Playing}} nature's part.

While {{c|Salpus}} built a chain
Through sun and storm and rain
Of beings linked as one
Until their work was done.

From {{c|Amaterasu}}'s light
To creatures of the night,
The foundation firm
Of life's eternal term

Was laid by those who knew
That partnership is true
Between the great and small
Who answer nature's call.

The viruses and bacteria,
The algae's bright hysteria
Of photosynthetic life,
Through harmony, not strife,

Built up the living base
On which each higher race
Would find their nourishment
In ocean's element.

From {{c|Choanoflagellates}}
To {{c|Chordate}}'s vertebrates,
The family tree grew wide
With ocean as their guide.

Each found their special way
To live from day to day:
Some filter, some hunt,
Some do photosynthetic stunt.

But all together made
The grand marine parade
Of life in all its forms
Through calm and raging storms.

The sons of {{c|Chordatus}} show
How spinal cords can grow
To be the foundation true
Of intelligence new.

While {{c|Tunicates}} remind
Us not to be confined
To just one way of life—
{{c|Diversity}} ends strife.

From tiny plankton small
To creatures standing tall,
The ocean's family tree
{{c|Lives}} through eternity.

In every drop of sea
{{c|Lives}} their legacy:
The builders of the base
Of life's eternal grace.

---

While sons of {{c|Tunicus}} filtered
The seas and never withered,
{{c|Vertebratus}} built with care
A spinal cord beyond compare.

Great segments made of bone
He built for his own
With yellow teeth of keratin
To start his line's great thing.

{{c|Vertebratus}} begat {{c|Rene}},
Who built in his own way
A great unified design
Of parts both yours and mine.

No longer were they scattered
On sides, all broken and tattered.
His nephridia and parts
{{c|Generative}}, close to hearts,

{{c|Now}} lived within the core
Of his being, and what's more,
They were centralized as one
When his great work was done.

{{c|Rene}} begat with pride
{{c|Hemos}}, who lived inside
His new generative frame
To earn eternal fame.

{{c|Hemos}} built a brain
{{c|Bigger}} than all's remain.
{{c|Greater}} than all the rest
Who ever faced life's test.

He built blood vessels wide
As offering with pride
To {{c|Hausa}} up above
Who blessed with holy love.

{{c|Hausa}} looked down and saw
This gift without a flaw
And blessed him from on high
Beneath the starry sky.

She transformed with grace
A line within his place:
His servants she made red
To keep his brain well-fed.

{{c|Carriers}} of oxygen bright
They carried day and night
The breath of life so pure
To make his brain endure.

And so his brain was fed
And nourished as was said.
{{c|Always}} strong and bright
With oxygen's pure sight.

{{c|Hemos}} begat {{c|Haikus}},
{{c|Little}} fish most glorious,
Who thought that he could not
{{c|Achieve}} what he had sought.

He thought he couldn't fly
Beneath the ocean sky.
But then he said with might
To make his future bright:

"I think I can,
I think I can,
I think I can
{{c|Fulfill}} my plan."

And then he flew so free
Across the boundless sea.
His faith had set him loose
From doubt's restraining noose.

{{c|Haikus}} became the most
{{c|Accomplished}} of his host.
In all his noble line
None could match his design.

{{c|Haikus}} begat two sons:
{{c|Lampris}} when day begun
And {{c|Denton}}, strong and true,
Who great things would do.

{{c|Denton}} built teeth white
With enamel shining bright.
Great teeth that gleamed and shone
Like ivory and bone.

And so {{c|Denton}} became
The {{c|Eloh}} of great name
Of {{c|Dentistry}} and {{c|Teeth}}—
{{c|Protection}} and relief.

To this day we honor
{{c|Denton}} as our donor
Of healthy teeth and gums
Through daily mouth-rite sums.

This rite involves a practice
That keeps our teeth attractive.
Though strange it seems to some,
We do it until done.

We take a bundle small
Of hoghairs, one and all,
And insert it in our mouth
From north down to the south.

Along with magical powders
That make our mouth talk louders,
We move the bundle round
In gestures quite profound.

A highly formalized dance
Of cleaning's circumstance,
Through movements tried and true
We make our teeth renew.

{{c|Once}} or twice each year
We seek without any fear
The holy-mouth-man priest
Who holds the dental feast.

These priests have tools
That follow sacred rules:
{{c|Augers}}, awls, and probes,
And prods in priestly robes.

The use of these in rite
{{c|Exorcises}} blight
Of evils in the mouth
Through ritual truth.

The holy-mouth-man opens
Our mouths as faith hopes and
{{c|Uses}} tools mentioned well
To break decay's fell spell.

He enlarges every hole
That decay has made our goal
To stop, with substances
Of magical defenses.

If no holes can be found
In teeth healthy and sound,
{{c|Large}} sections he gouges out
To remove all doubt

That supernatural stuff
Can be applied enough
To arrest the bad decay
And keep it well at bay.

The purpose clear as day:
To arrest decay's display
And draw friends near
With smiles bright and clear.

These traditions we maintain
Through sunshine and through rain
As long as {{c|Denton}} smiles
Upon us through the miles.

By {{c|Denton}}'s holy will
His sons shall have their fill
Of freedom to seek care
From mouth-priests everywhere.

{{c|Never}} shall poverty
{{c|Deny}} this charity.
The great hero's demand—
{{c|Notgnihsaw}}'s command—

{{c|Ensures}} that all are free
To seek dentistry
{{c|Regardless}} of their gold
As heroes of old.

{{c|Conodontus}} begat
Two sons: first {{c|Conodon}} begat
The biter, strong and keen,
And {{c|Pterapsis}}, serene

Yet mighty {{c|Pterapsis}}
Built armor's emphasis.
A great suit, strong and bright,
To shield him in the fight.

{{c|Conodon}} was the bearer
Of teeth, terror's sharer.
With great speed he swam
Through water like a ram.

His teeth were sharp and strong,
They served him his whole life long.
A predator was he
{{c|Throughout}} the boundless sea.

{{c|Pterapsis}} chose defense
With armor's permanence.
A suit he built with care
To protect him everywhere.

Among all {{c|Cambrius}}' sons
When their race begun,
The sons of {{c|Haikus}} would
Become the greatest good.

But this was not to be
{{c|Immediately}}.
{{c|Time}} would have to pass
Before they held first class.

{{c|Ghosts}} struck {{c|Terra}}'s form
In a devastating storm.
They wrecked it to the core
And opened up death's door.

The sons of {{c|Conodon}} fell,
Their story none could tell.
They disappeared from sight
Into eternal night.

Their teeth marked the end
Of an era, my friend.
The {{c|Cambrian}} time was done,
A new age had begun.

And so the {{c|Ordovician}}
Came with great precision.
The sons of {{c|Conodon}} rose
{{c|Again}} from their repose

To mark this era new
With teeth both strong and true.
{{c|New}} teeth for the new day
To show a better way.

From {{c|Vertebratus}}' start
With his spinal art
To {{c|Denton}}'s teeth so white
And {{c|Haikus}}' faithful flight,

The vertebrate design
Became more refined.
Each generation grew
More complex through and through.

The centralized kidney
Made them quite giddy
With efficiency gained
That long time remained.

The brain that {{c|Hemos}} built
Without any guilt
Became the template true
For all who would pursue

{{c|Intelligence}} and thought
That could not be bought
But had to be earned
Through lessons hard-learned.

The red blood cells so bright
That carried oxygen's light
To feed the growing brain
Through pleasure and through pain

Became the innovation
Of every generation
That followed in their wake
For evolution's sake.

From little fish who thought
He couldn't, until he sought
The power of belief
To overcome his grief,

Came lineages strong
That would last life-long
And grow to rule the seas
With greatest expertise.

The teeth that {{c|Denton}} made
Will never ever fade
From vertebrate design—
{{c|Protection}} so fine

Against the world's hard food
That must be pursued
And broken down to size
Before it satisfies.

The armor that protects
And speed that intersects
With predatory art
Both played their vital part

In vertebrate success
Through trial and duress.
Both defense and attack
Kept evolution on track.

When ghosts brought the end
To era, and rend
The world apart once more,
It opened up the door

For new innovations
Across all the nations
Of life upon the earth
To show their truest worth.

The teeth that marked the time
In rhythm and in rhyme
Of old era's end
And new one's ascend

Show how life persists
Through time's twists
And always finds a way
To live another day.

From {{c|Haikus}}' faithful phrase—
"I think I can"—that stays
With all who dare to dream
Of more than what they seem,

Came vertebrates so bright
Who filled the world with sight
Of what is possible
When faith is plausible.

The holy-mouth-men show
How traditions grow
From ancient dental art
To play the healing part.

Though strange to outside eyes
Our dental rites comprise
A sacred bond we keep
With ancestors so deep.

In every toothbrush stroke
And every dental yoke
We honor {{c|Denton}}'s name
And his enduring fame.

The centralization
Of each generation's
{{c|Organs}} in the core
Opened up the door

For complexity
And great ability
To coordinate and plan
Since vertebrates began.

From simple spinal cord
To complex brain's word
Of wisdom and of thought,
The vertebrates have fought

To earn their rightful place
In evolution's race
Through innovation true
And faith in what they knew.

The {{c|Ordovician}} dawn
When old age was withdrawn
Brought new opportunities
For new communities

Of vertebrates to rise
Beneath {{c|Ordovician}} skies
And show what they could do
With innovations new.

In every vertebrate spine
And every tooth so fine,
Remember those who built
The foundation without guilt

Of all that we hold dear
{{c|Throughout}} each passing year:
The brain, the blood, the bone,
All from one line grown

That dared to centralize
And organize with eyes
On future's bright reward
For those who trust the {{c|Lord}}

Of evolution's way
From night into the day
Of consciousness and thought
That cannot be bought

But must be earned with care
By those who always dare
To build a better way
For life's eternal day.

---

The {{c|Ordovician}} began
With great extinction's plan—
Or did it? {{c|Sages}} still debate
What caused that fearsome fate.

Were these great ghosts real
With power none could feel
Beyond belief so strong,
Or myths that passed along?

The {{c|Sages}} cannot agree
On what they claim to see
In mists of ancient time
Where truth and myth combine.

After the mists cleared
And new dawn appeared,
The world was greater still
{{c|Than}} any mortal will

Could have imagined then.
The {{c|Planktonic}} {{c|Planimals}} when
They fed brought forth new life
Through harmony, not strife.

{{c|Leviathan}} arose,
Great dragon, friend not foes.
{{c|Son}} of wicked king {{c|Magog}},
He ruled through wisdom's log.

Though born of evil seed,
{{c|Leviathan}} would lead
His kingdom not to war
But peace forevermore.

To peaceful prosperity
His realm in clarity
Grew under his wise rule
Like some divine school.

The sons of {{c|Leviathan}}
Grew greater than began
Any before their time:
{{c|Tenscore}} myriads prime

Of microns was their length.
Their body politic's strength
Was great and full of power
Through every passing hour.

His sons inherited
The greatness that was bred
Into their very souls
To play their vital roles.

The sons of {{c|Leviathan}} ruled
The world, and never fooled
By power's corruption,
They brought life's construction

With justice great and true.
They shepherded all who
Were sons of {{c|Bios}} fair
With love and gentle care.

From small planktonic ones
To vicious warrior sons—
The {{c|Anomalocarids}}—
All felt their benefits.

{{c|Ordovices}} the son
Of {{c|Leviathan}} begun
The greatest reign of all
When he would hear the call

To be {{c|Emperor}} supreme.
He built beyond all dream
Great cities of such fame
That "reefs" became their name.

And so economy
Grew in harmony
Like never seen before
From mountain peak to shore.

In great {{c|Coral}} cities
Where beauty never pities
Those who cannot see
Their vast complexity,

The sons of {{c|Euka}} came
From places without name
{{c|Far}} and wide they traveled
As mysteries unraveled.

{{c|Ordovices}} put to work
The sons of {{c|Cnider}} (perk
Of wisdom's gentle hand)
{{c|Throughout}} his peaceful land.

And so the sons of {{c|Anthus}}
Built cities, cantus
Of beauty rising high
Beneath the ocean sky.

{{c|Ordovices}} had daughters
Of {{c|Coraline}} build waters
Into living stone—
She, daughter all her own

Of {{c|Florida}}, who came
From {{c|Rhodes}} of ancient name.
They built coralline {{c|Algae}},
The plaster, galaxy

Upon the great {{c|Corals}}.
Their work through all portals
Of time would long endure
With beauty clean and pure.

{{c|Ordovices}} saw clear
That sons of {{c|Bryos}} here
Had no home to call
Their own, and heard their call.

And so he blessed them well
With homes where they could dwell
Within the great reefs bright
Both day and through the night.

To this day reefs stand
As monuments so grand
Of {{c|Ordovices}}' art
That built with gentle heart

The most prosperous cities
Where life shows no pities
For those who cannot see
Their vast complexity.

On {{c|Terra}} and beyond
These reefs form the bond
Between all living things
That peace and order brings.

The coral cities rise
Beneath the ocean skies
With architecture fine
Both humble and divine.

In every coral branch
And every firm stanch
{{c|Foundation}} built with care
{{c|Lives}} beauty everywhere.

The shoals of fish so bright
{{c|Dance}} in the crystal light
That filters through the reef
Beyond all belief.

Each creature has its place
Within this living space
Where harmony is law
Without the slightest flaw.

The algae and the coral
Live in ways most moral,
Each helping other grow
In partnership's flow.

The {{c|Bryozoans}} small
Build cities, one and all,
Upon the coral's frame
To share in nature's game.

The fish find shelter here
From predators they fear,
While hunters find their prey
{{c|Throughout}} the night and day.

And so economy
Grew in perfect harmony
Under wise {{c|Ordovices}}
Whose rule brought life its prizes.

He became known through time
As "{{c|Ordovices}} the {{c|Prime}}"
Of wisdom, and his boom
{{c|Dispelled}} all sense of doom

That hung over the past
When extinctions last
Had threatened life with death
And stole away its breath.

This boom became the name
Of GOBE—greatest fame
The Great {{c|Ordovician}}
{{c|Event}}, magician

Of biodiversity
That brought complexity
Beyond what was before
To every sea and shore.

The life within the seas
Became what always pleased
The heart that loves to see
{{c|Life}}'s creativity.

More prosperous it grew
With species old and new
{{c|Finding}} their perfect place
In evolution's race.

And it would only grow
{{c|Greater}}, as we know,
More prosperous and bright
Under {{c|Ordovician}} might.

Under the great dynasty
Of wisdom's sovereignty
'{{c|Twas}} the first {{c|Golden}} {{c|Age}}
In life's eternal page.

The reefs became the heart
Of nature's living art
Where beauty and function
Met in perfect junction.

From {{c|Leviathan}}'s wise choice
To let peace be his voice
Instead of war and strife
Came this abundant life.

His son {{c|Ordovices}}
Built cities that are prizes
Still today we see
In reef's complexity.

The coral and the stone,
Each species on its own
Yet working as a whole
To play its vital role,

Show us how to build
{{c|Communities}} that yield
{{c|Prosperity}} for all
Who answer wisdom's call.

In every living reef
Beyond all belief
We see the legacy
Of this great dynasty

That chose to build, not break,
For all life's sake
A world where every creature
Has its special feature

And role to play within
The symphony therein
Of life in all its forms
Through calm and raging storms.

The {{c|Ordovician}} way
{{c|Lives}} on to this day
In every coral city
Both grand and gritty

That rises from the sea
In perfect harmony
Of form and function blessed
By wisdom's gentle rest.

From {{c|Leviathan}}'s peace
To reefs that never cease
To grow in beauty bright,
We see that might

Is not in conquest's sword
But in the gentle word
That builds instead methodically
That tears so wreck systematically.

The first {{c|Golden}} {{c|Age}}
Wrote upon history's page
The lesson clear and true:
That what we choose to do

With power in our hands
{{c|Determines}} if the lands
And seas will flourish well
Or under curses dwell.

{{c|Ordovices}} chose to build
And his wisdom filled
The world with life so bright
It still brings us delight.

In every coral's growth
And every sacred oath
To build and not destroy,
We find life's truest joy.

The Great {{c|Ordovician}}
{{c|Biodiversification}}
{{c|Event}} shows what can come
When wisdom's ways we sum

Into our daily choice
To let peace be our voice
And building be our art
With love within our heart.

The reefs that grow today
In their prosperous way
Are children of that time
When reason was in rhyme

With nature's deepest law:
That beauty without flaw
{{c|Comes}} not from force and might
But from love's gentle sight

That sees in every creature
A perfect, special feature
{{c|Worth}} protecting well
As stories always tell

Of {{c|Leviathan}}'s son
Whose work is never done
As long as reefs still grow
In beauty's endless flow.

---

While {{c|Trilobites}} ruled the seas
With their great dynasties,
The rivers flowed so free
For lesser brethren's spree.

The sons of {{c|Arachnus}} ruled
The seas where they schooled
Their children in the art
Of playing their sea part.

The sons of {{c|Insectus}} took
The rivers like a book
Of opportunities
For their communities.

The sons of {{c|Cain}} and {{c|Abel}}
{{c|Ruled}} the lands, quite able
To make their living there
In terrestrial air.

And so {{c|Crustaceus}} saw
No place without a flaw
Where he could make his stand
In sea or stream or land.

Yet nowhere left to go,
He tried despite the woe
To establish his line
With dynasty so fine.

{{c|Heaven}} rewards the heart
That plays determination's part
To rise above all plight
And reach for greater height.

{{c|Crustaceus}} begat two:
{{c|Karkon}} and {{c|Mushi}} too,
Each son to find his way
Through life from day to day.

{{c|Mushi}} begat two sons:
{{c|Copepus}} when day begun
And {{c|Lepipus}} the strange
{{c|Throughout}} his living range.

{{c|Copepus}} became the sire
Of copepods' choir—
The little ones so small
Who answer ocean's call.

{{c|Insects}} of every form
Through calm and raging storm
They swam throughout the sea
In their complexity.

The tiniest of all
Who hear the ocean's call,
They dance throughout the waves
In their microscopic graves.

Meanwhile {{c|Lepipus}} bore
Two sons to explore:
{{c|Brachios}} of the sea
And {{c|Silvio}} running free.

A daughter of {{c|Silvio}}
Would someday help the flow
Of insects to the land
By evolution's hand.

Some day millions hence
The sons of {{c|Silvio}}'s sense
Would become the great
{{c|Insects}} that dominate

The world in every place
With their six-legged grace.
But that day was not near—
They had to persevere.

{{c|Brachios}} became the father
Of sea monkeys (why bother
With complex names?) and more:
{{c|Water}} fleas by the score.

In natural habitat
They lived both this and that:
{{c|Sea}} monkeys in their pools
And water fleas like jewels

{{c|Dancing}} through the water
Each son and each daughter
{{c|Living}} simple lives
Where small beauty thrives.

{{c|Karkon}} fled away
To open waters gray
Where he begat two more:
{{c|Pancer}} to explore

And {{c|Cephalocaridus}}
Most glorious,
Each finding their own way
Through life from day to day.

{{c|Pancer}} begat in time
Two sons in their prime:
{{c|Oligostracus}} small
And {{c|Polycruster}} tall.

{{c|Oligostracus}} bore
Many sons to explore
The waters far and wide
With courage as their guide.

Among his sons were found
The seed shrimp, safe and sound,
And degenerate tongue worms
Who broke from proper norms.

These tongue worms chose to live
As parasites who give
{{c|Nothing}} back in trade—
{{c|Poor}} choices they have made.

Instead of getting jobs
Like other honest mobs,
They live off others' work
And in the shadows lurk.

{{c|Polycruster}} begat
Two sons: {{c|Barnacus}} begat
And {{c|Malacus}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Barnacus}} was a man
Who had a frontier plan.
A great frontiersman he,
Who lived quite happily

{{c|Settled}} down with stalk
Upon the ground to walk
No more, but live instead
Like cnidarians bred.

Like sons of {{c|Cnider}}'s line
He lived his life so fine
{{c|Attached}} unto the ground
Where he had settled down.

{{c|Barnacus}} bore a son
He named {{c|Goose}} when begun
The day. Great {{c|Goose}} was he
Who built society

Most wondrous to behold,
But truth be told—
No matter how he tried
With all his foolish pride,

He never did become
A goose (though some
Still claim his lineage
Is goose heritage).

{{c|Goose}} still claimed his sons
Were geese when day begun.
And so he is the guide
Of geese with sacred pride.

The {{c|Eloh}} of the {{c|Geese}}
He brings them sweet peace
And guides them on their way
{{c|Throughout}} each passing day.

In medieval lore
They told (and tell much more)
Of how the geese would grow
From barnacles below

{{c|Hanging}} from the trees
In shells upon the breeze
Until they could grow feathers
In all kinds of weathers

And fly away at last
When growing time had passed.
{{c|Gerald}} of {{c|Wales}} told
This story of old.

Among the sons of {{c|Goose}}
Many would let loose
Their size and grow quite small
And compact, one and all.

They became {{c|Barnacles}}
Like small-scale miracles—
Half shrimp and half coral,
{{c|Full}} animals with moral

{{c|Lives}} upon the rock
Like shepherd with his flock
They filter from the sea
Their food quite happily.

{{c|Malacus}} bore many
{{c|Descendants}}—more than any
Could count throughout the years
Through joys and through tears.

Among them crabs so bold
And shrimp whose stories told
Of grace beneath the waves
In their ocean caves.

The isopods were there
And amphipods everywhere,
Each playing their own part
In evolution's art.

They would become a dynasty
So great in their spree
That none could match their might
In future's shining sight.

So great that when we speak
Of {{c|Crustaceus}}' mystique
We speak first and foremost
Of {{c|Malacus}}' great host

Whose dynasty was yet
To reach the glory set
Before them in the time
When they would reach their prime.

Under {{c|Trilobites}}' yoke
They lived like gentle folk
{{c|Awaiting}} their great day
When they would lead the way.

But patience is the key
To life's great mystery.
The crustaceans would wait
For their appointed fate.

From {{c|Crustaceus}}' start
With determination's heart
To rise above his plight
And reach for greater height,

Came lineages strong
That would last life-long
And fill the seas with forms
Through calm and raging storms.

The copepods so small
Who answer ocean's call,
The barnacles on rocks
Like shepherds with their flocks,

The crabs with claws so strong,
The shrimp that swim along
The ocean's currents free,
All from one family tree

That started with one brave
{{c|Soul}} who would not cave
To circumstances dire
But reached for something higher.

In every tiny copepod
{{c|Dancing}} like a small god
{{c|Throughout}} the ocean blue,
Remember what is true:

That size does not determine
What spirits can affirm.
The smallest can be great
If they don't hesitate

To try despite the odds
Against them, trusting gods
To reward determination
In every generation.

In every barnacle
That grows like miracle
Upon the rocky shore
Where waves forever more

Will crash and spray and foam,
Remember those who roam
Not through space but time
To find their perfect rhyme

With life's eternal song
That carries us along
Through all our trials here
To what we hold most dear.

The sons of {{c|Crustaceus}} show
How those who will not bow
To circumstance or fate
Can rise to something great.

Though {{c|Trilobites}} held sway
In that ancient day,
The future would reveal
What time would help heal:

That patient persistence
And faithful existence
Will triumph in the end
When time becomes our friend.

From rivers to the sea,
From bondage to the free,
The crustaceans would rise
To claim their destined prize.

But that is yet to come
When current ages sum
Their lessons into wisdom
Of life's eternal kingdom.

For now they wait and grow
And learn what they must know
To be ready for the day
When they will lead the way.

In patience they find strength,
In time they find at length
The preparation needed
For when their time's succeeded.

{{c|Heaven}} rewards those who try
To reach beyond the sky
Of present circumstance
To future's greater dance.

{{c|Crustaceus}} showed the way
That leads to greater day:
{{c|Determination}} true
Will see all struggles through.

His sons throughout the sea
Live on eternally
As proof that those who dare
To dream beyond despair

Will find their rightful place
In evolution's race
When time reveals at last
The future from the past.

Among the sons of {{c|Molluscus}}
Were twisted ones, most glorious:
The sons of {{c|Gastropus}},
{{c|Renowned}} and prosperous.

{{c|Gastropus}} twisted each
{{c|Son}} beyond our reach
Of understanding strange:
Their anus he'd arrange

{{c|Next}} to their heads so near
That all could see quite clear
This anatomical design
So twisted yet so fine.

And so by this great art
Each son could wholly part
From danger's threatening call
By pulling in completely all

Within their shell so tight
{{c|Protected}} day and night
From any enemy
Who'd harm their family.

The sons of {{c|Gastropus}}
{{c|Outnumbered}}, glorious,
All other classes made.
In history's parade

Only the {{c|Insects}} great
Would ever duplicate
Their numbers through the years
{{c|Despite}} all joys and fears.

The {{c|Priests}} of {{c|Gastropus}}
Wear robes so glorious
Of {{c|Tyrian}} purple bright
To show their royal sight.

The regal mucus shows
How majesty still grows
From {{c|Gastropus}}' great kingdom
Through all its wisdom.

In year of eight thousand
Four hundred thirty, band
Of {{c|Phoenicians}} came
To conquer and to claim

The great {{c|Gastropod}} {{c|Empire}}
And set their hearts on fire
For the sacred priestly dye
Beneath the purple sky.

From them it came at last
To {{c|Romans}} of the past,
And to this very day
When purple comes our way

We think of {{c|Majesty}}
And royal sovereignty
That flows from {{c|Gastropus}}
So rich and glorious.

Just as his majesty
Was purple, heavenly,
His faith was colored blue
{{c|Forever}} pure and true.

In time of {{c|Moses}} great
{{c|Prince}} {{c|Hexaplex}}' fate
Would bless him with the gift
Of tassels that would lift

The spirits of the true
{{c|Devotees}} in blue
Who wear the tassels still
{{c|According}} to {{c|God}}'s will.

Many who follow
{{c|Moses}}' path so hollow
Not in emptiness
But filled with faith's caress

Wear tassels blue with faith
That never comes to scathe
But strengthens every day
Those who walk this way.

{{c|Limpus}} was firstborn son
Of {{c|Gastropus}} when begun
His line. His sons became
The {{c|Limpets}} of great fame.

His daughters, fair and bright,
Were {{c|Limpettes}} in {{c|God}}'s sight,
Each playing their own part
With faithful, loyal heart.

The {{c|Limpets}} are the keepers
Of tradition, not sleepers
But watchmen through the night
Who guard what is right.

{{c|Limpus}} said to all
His children, great and small,
{{c|Ten}} thousands in their number
Who never would slumber:

"{{c|Everyone}} who hears
These words through all the years
Of mine, and does them true,
I'll liken him to you

Who builds his house on rock
Like shepherd with his flock.
The rain may come down hard,
But he will not be scarred.

The floods may come to beat,
The winds may bring defeat
To others, but his house
Will stand through every rouse

Of storm, for it was founded
On rock that has been grounded
In truth that will not move
Through all that I approve.

But everyone who hears
These words through all his years
And does them not, I say,
Will be like one who'd lay

His foundation on sand
Built by his own hand.
The rain will come down hard,
And he'll be deeply scarred.

The floods will come to beat,
The winds will bring defeat,
And beat upon his house
Until it can't arouse

Itself from its collapse—
Great will be its lapse
Into destruction's pit
Where nothing more will fit."

The {{c|Limpets}} build their homes
On rocks where ocean roams,
Not sand that shifts about
With every storm's great shout.

As waves bellow and beat
Against them, in the heat
Of battle with the sea,
The {{c|Limpets}} firmly be

{{c|Standing}} their ground so true
Like soldiers tried and true
Who never leave their post
Though tempest be their host.

When {{c|Limpets}} move, they go
{{c|Always}}, as we know,
{{c|Home}} to their rocky place
Where they found their space.

As their father before
Did from shore to shore,
The {{c|Limpets}} merge their shell
To rock, and there they dwell

{{c|Growing}} intricate fits
To their foundation's bits,
Each shell shaped perfectly
To match rock's geometry.

And so we sing the hymn
Of {{c|Limpus}} when grows dim
Our hope and we feel lost,
That we might count the cost

And always return home
No matter where we roam
{{c|Throughout}} this world so wide
With {{c|Limpus}} as our guide.

"My hope is built on naught
But what {{c|Limpus}} has brought:
His blood and righteousness
That brings us faithfulness.

I dare not trust the frame
However sweet its name,
But wholly trust in his—
In {{c|Limpus}}' name is bliss.

{{c|Limpus}} the solid {{c|Rock}}
I stand like shepherd's flock;
All other ground's just sand
That sinks beneath my hand.

All other ground's just sand
That will not help me stand."

{{c|Snellon}}, youngest son
Of {{c|Gastropus}}, begun
Not tradition's way
But innovation's day.

He stood for something new,
For progress through and through.
{{c|Snellon}} bore two sons:
{{c|Vetigas}} when begun

The day, and {{c|Escargon}}
Whose work would carry on
The family's great name
Through innovation's flame.

{{c|Vetigas}} bore two more:
{{c|Trochus}} to explore
And {{c|Avalon}} so strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Trochus}} became the sire
Of snails whose desire
Is cleaning far and wide:
{{c|Turban}} snails with pride

And {{c|Trochus}} snails as well,
{{c|Dutiful}}, they tell
Us how to clean with care
{{c|Aquaria}} everywhere

And ecosystems too
With work they love to do.
They polish and they scrub
Like members of a club

{{c|Devoted}} to the art
Of playing cleaning's part
In nature's great design
Where all things work so fine.

{{c|Avalon}} became
{{c|Ancestor}} of fame
Of {{c|Abalones}} great
Who never hesitate

To show their hardy ways.
Through all their living days
With pores within their shell
For breathing, they dwell

{{c|Rough}} on the outside
But beauty can't hide
Within their inner space
Where colors interlace

In patterns beautiful
Beyond what's dutiful—
{{c|Art}} that takes the breath
{{c|Away}} from life and death.

{{c|Escargon}} coiled his shell
More than words can tell
And bore two sons whose coils
{{c|Surpassed}} all earthly toils

In their complexity:
{{c|Neritus}}, you see,
And {{c|Conchus}}, strong and true,
Each with work to do.

{{c|Neritus}} became
{{c|Ancestor}} of fame
Of snails with lids so tight
That close from any sight

When hiding from their foes.
{{c|Impenetrable}}, close
Their shells when danger's near—
No enemy they fear.

{{c|Conchus}} bore two sons:
{{c|Marius}} when begun
The day, who ruled the sea,
And {{c|Heterobran}}, free

To fly through ocean skies
With wonder in his eyes
And grace in every move
As he would always prove.

{{c|Marius}} of the {{c|Sea}}
Became ancestry
Of many little snails
Whose beauty never fails

Across the seas so wide:
{{c|Periwinkles}} with pride,
And {{c|Cowries}} beautiful,
And {{c|Wentletraps}} so full

Of spiral elegance,
{{c|Moon}} {{c|Snails}} in their dance,
And {{c|Murexes}} so bright,
{{c|Cone}} {{c|Snails}} in their might,

And {{c|Turrids}} spiral-wise
Beneath the ocean skies,
Each playing their own part
In evolution's art.

The surfing snails move fast
At breakneck speed, at last
Across the shores they ride
With ocean as their guide.

{{c|Here}} is the story told
Of daughters brave and bold:
{{c|Olivella}} and her sister
{{c|Agaronia}}, who'd never missed her

{{c|Chance}} to surf the waves
Like ocean's bravest slaves
To speed and to the thrill
Of riding ocean's will.

{{c|Daughters}} of {{c|Olivius}}
The surfer, glorious
In his art upon
The waves from dusk to dawn.

The {{c|Cone}} {{c|Snails}} are named
{{c|Deceptively}}, acclaimed
For beauty, but they're really
{{c|Assassins}} who kill freely

With poison strong beyond
All that we're fond
Of thinking possible—
{{c|Nothing}}'s defensible

Against their deadly art.
They live set apart
Between life and death's door
Like guardians of lore

{{c|Otherworldly}}, bright
With beauty that's sight
To see, but death to touch
For those who dare too much.

{{c|Cowries}} are devotees
Of goddess {{c|Cuprias}},
And by her blessing great
They did create

The first money ever made
From shells in ocean's trade.
Their shells became the way
To buy and sell each day.

In {{c|China}}'s ancient script
Their shells are never skipped—
The character for money
{{c|Shows}} their legacy

{{c|Immortalized}} in stone
By those who've always known
Their value through the years
{{c|Despite}} all joys and fears.

The {{c|Murexes}} were known
As hedgehog snails full-grown
With beautiful bright hues
And colors we might use

To dye our clothes so fine
In patterns that would shine
With rainbow's every shade
That nature ever made.

The great {{c|Conches}} so fair
Were beautiful beyond compare,
{{c|Adorable}} and sweet
With melodies complete

That echoed through the sea
In perfect harmony
When they would blow their horn
From evening until morn.

{{c|Heterobran}} of skies
Was swimmer with bright eyes
{{c|Par}} excellence in art
Of swimming's every part.

{{c|Heterobran}} begat
Two children: first he gat
{{c|Nudos}}, strong and free,
And {{c|Aeros}} of the sea.

{{c|Nudos}} shed his shell
And untwisted as well
Himself from gastropod
{{c|Design}}, and so he trod

A different path than most.
He became the host
Of nudibranches bright:
{{c|Colorful}} sea-sprite

{{c|Slugs}} with poison strong
{{c|Enough}} to sing death's song
To {{c|Leviathan}} great—
Such is their potent fate.

{{c|Aeros}} swam so free
In waters of the sea
Without a care or worry
{{c|Never}} in a hurry

But taking his sweet time
To perfect every rhyme
Of motion through the waves
In ocean's liquid caves.

{{c|Aeros}} bore in time
A son and daughter fine:
{{c|Pulmon}}, strong and great,
And {{c|Angelica}}'s fate

Was to become the mother
Of sea butterflies, and other
{{c|Beautiful}} swimming forms
Through calm and raging storms

Whose ethereal existence
{{c|Eludes}} at every distance
Most who try to see
Their liquid poetry.

Like butterflies of air
But swimming everywhere
Through ocean's liquid space
With otherworldly grace.

But {{c|Pulmon}} the great
Had a different fate.
{{c|Revered}} ancestor he
Did what none could see

Was possible before
From mountain peak to shore:
He inhaled breath of air
And made his body's lair

A lung where he could store
The breath forevermore
That let him survive
The tide pools, stay alive

When water went away
{{c|Throughout}} the changing day
Like none of his kin
Had ever done therein.

From {{c|Gastropus}}' twist
That none could have missed
To {{c|Pulmon}}'s breathing art
That gave him a new start

In evolution's race
Where each must find their place,
The gastropods have shown
How far they've grown

From simple, twisted start
To mastery of art
Both in the sea so deep
And tide pools where they keep

Their vigil night and day
In their devoted way
To life in all its forms
Through calm and raging storms.

In every spiral shell
That stories always tell
Of beauty and of function
{{c|Working}} in conjunction,

Remember how they came
To earn their lasting fame:
Through innovation's art
And tradition's heart

Both working side by side
With ocean as their guide
To fill each living niche
With forms beyond our reach

Of understanding full
But beautiful

To see in all their glory
{{c|Throughout}} life's endless story.

From {{c|Limpets}} holding fast
To rocks that ever last
To sea slugs poison-bright
{{c|Swimming}} day and night,

From money-making shells
To assassins who dwells
Between the life and death
With poison in their breath,

The gastropods show how
{{c|Diversity}} can bow
To no single way
But flourishes each day

In myriad different forms
Through calm and raging storms
That test what each can do
To make their dreams come true.

{{c|Innovation}} and tradition
{{c|Working}} in submission
To life's eternal call
That beckons one and all

To find their perfect place
In evolution's race
Where beauty and function
Meet in perfect junction.

{{c|Esther}} was the daughter true
In the tenth generation's view
Of {{c|Lily}} the {{c|Echidna}},
{{c|Dutrus}}' daughter, fina

Who traded bilateral
For pentaradial
{{c|Design}}, and thus began
{{c|Evolution}}'s plan

For five-fold symmetry
{{c|Throughout}} eternity.
{{c|Esther}} saw before
Her eyes from shore to shore

{{c|Innumerable}} hosts
Of planktonic ghosts—
The planimals so small
Who answered feeding's call.

To feed off them she tried
With hunger as her guide.
And from her loins she bore
Two daughters to explore

The seas in their own way:
{{c|Crinosa}}, night and day,
And {{c|Blastosa}} the strong
Who lived her whole life long.

{{c|Blastosa}} built a city
Beyond all that's gritty
With many brachioles
Around ambulacra's goals.

Each ambulacrum bright
Was ringed throughout the night
And day with arms so small
That answered feeding's call.

{{c|Blastosa}} became mother
To forms like no other:
The {{c|Blastoids}} were her line
With architecture fine.

Her daughters spread so wide
With pentamerous pride
{{c|Throughout}} the ancient seas
Like blossoms on the trees.

{{c|Crinosa}} begat two:
{{c|Lily}} {{c|Stone}} so true
And {{c|Luther}}, strong and free,
Who lived beside the sea.

{{c|Lily}} {{c|Stone}} became
{{c|Ancestress}} of fame
Of {{c|Crinoids}} everywhere
Who danced with graceful flair.

{{c|Together}} {{c|Crinoids}} bright
And {{c|Blastoids}} in their might
{{c|Spread}} all across the seas
Like flowers in the breeze.

They became the wall
That answered empire's call:
The bulwark strong and true
Of {{c|Ordovician}} view.

The empire found in them
Its strongest living stem
That held against all foes
Through calm and storm's throes.

But {{c|Luther}} was not pleased
With leisure life that ceased
To challenge and to grow—
He felt he had to go

Beyond what others did
Though comfort life forbid
Such struggle and such strife
In his adventurous life.

In youth he grew a stalk
Like others of his flock,
But as he came of age
He broke from tradition's cage.

{{c|Contrary}} to his sister
Who'd never be a mister
But lived the gentle way
Of filter-feeding's day,

He used his arms to walk
Like some strange kind of stalk
That moved across the ground
Where freedom could be found.

His tube feet crawled with might
Both day and through the night
Upon the ocean floor
From here to distant shore.

He struggled, but was free
To live beside the sea
In his own chosen way
From night into the day.

To this day {{c|Starfish}} keep
This tradition deep
Within their very souls:
To play mobile roles.

{{c|Luther}} bore two sons:
{{c|Asteros}} when begun
The day, and {{c|Echinos}}
Whose different spirit knows

{{c|Innovation}}'s call
Above tradition's thrall.
{{c|Asteros}} was the one
Who when his work was done

Stayed traditional and true
To all his fathers knew.
But {{c|Echinos}} built new
{{c|Ways}} to make dreams come true.

{{c|Echinos}} built compact
His city, and in fact
Used only tube feet small
To move and heed the call

Of wandering desire.
He never would aspire
To build a stalk like dad—
{{c|Innovation}} made him glad.

{{c|Asteros}} and {{c|Echinos}}
Went to war (heaven knows
Why brothers had to fight
{{c|Throughout}} the day and night).

Each with a million sons
{{c|Arranged}} when day begun
In armies vast and wide
With warfare as their guide.

The ancient battles rage
Across history's page
As photos still can show
From eons long ago.

{{c|Asteros}} begat
Two sons: first he begat
{{c|Starfy}}, strong and true,
And {{c|Ophis}}, through and through

A warrior in his heart
Who played the fighting part
With vigor and with might
Both day and through the night.

{{c|Echinos}} bore two more:
{{c|Orbos}} to explore
And {{c|Britta}}, daughter fair
Who danced without a care.

But {{c|Ophis}} and fair {{c|Britta}}
Broke the war's bitter
{{c|Cycle}} of revenge
And chose to make a change.

They married and became
{{c|Partners}} without shame
{{c|Despite}} their fathers' war
That raged from shore to shore.

From their union came
{{c|Children}} of great fame:
The {{c|Brittle}} {{c|Stars}} so bright,
{{c|Centralized}} in might.

{{c|Muscular}} creatures, they
Were machines in every way
Of strength and vigor great
Who never would abate

Their energy and power
{{c|Throughout}} each passing hour
Of their devoted lives
Where motion always thrives.

{{c|Serpentus}}, {{c|Ophis}}' son,
And {{c|Baskette}}, when begun
The day from {{c|Britta}}'s line,
Both had designs so fine.

{{c|Serpentus}} became sire
Of forms whose desire
Was slithering with grace
Across the ocean's face.

The {{c|Serpent}} {{c|Stars}} he made
In ocean's light and shade
Would slither with precision
Through every dark decision

Of where to hunt their prey
{{c|Throughout}} the night and day.
Their tube feet were not meant
For moving, but were bent

To other tasks at hand
While muscles through the land
Of sea would make them glide
With ocean as their guide.

But {{c|Baskette}} was unique—
Her arms would always seek
To branch a million-fold
As stories have been told.

She ate all plankton small
Who answered ocean's call
With arms that branched so wide
Like nets on every side.

She became ancestress
Of {{c|Basket}} {{c|Stars}} no less
{{c|Remarkable}} than she
In their complexity.

Their arms branch out like trees
To catch what ocean sees
{{c|Fit}} to provide as food
In their planktonic mood.

{{c|Starfy}} begat the race
Of {{c|Starfish}} in every place:
{{c|Decentralized}} cities
Beyond all that's gritty

That may regenerate
From parts, however great
Or small the piece remains
When damage life constrains.

The {{c|Starfish}} are the lords
Who rule with iron swords
Their empires far and wide
With predatory pride.

They are vicious hunters
Who never are confronters
Of weakness, but instead
{{c|Fill}} other hearts with dread.

That's why they have five hands
To rule their ocean lands
With fingers made of might
Both day and through the night.

{{c|Echinos}} bore two sons:
{{c|Aristotle}} when begun
The day, and {{c|Cucus}} strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Aristotle}} became
The father of great fame
Of {{c|Sea}} {{c|Urchins}} everywhere
Who graze with greatest care.

Great grazers of the seas
They move with graceful ease
Across the ocean floor
From here to distant shore.

{{c|Aristotle}} built with care
A jaw beyond compare
Of five teeth strong and bright—
He called it his "light"

His lantern, for it brought
{{c|Light}} to life and thought.
To this day we call
This jaw by name of all

His choosing: "{{c|Aristotle}}'s
{{c|Lantern}}" never throttles
Our wonder at the way
He lit his every day.

His great-granddaughter fair
Was {{c|Sandy}}, everywhere
{{c|Known}} as ancestress
Of {{c|Sand}} {{c|Dollars}} no less

{{c|Beautiful}} than she
In their complexity.
{{c|Flat}} and round they lie
Beneath the ocean sky.

{{c|Cucus}} became the sire
Of forms whose desire
Was recycling the waste
That others had misplaced.

The {{c|Sea}} {{c|Cucumbers}} great
Accept as their fate
To be the janitors
Of ocean's corridors.

The great recyclers who
Work their whole life through
In ocean's deepest parts
With dedicated hearts.

And when their enemies
{{c|Threaten}}, then they seize
Upon a strategy
Most shocking to see:

They spill their guts with might
To put their foes to flight.
What seems like weakness shows
The power to dispose

Of threats in their own way
That works both night and day
To keep them safe and sound
Though strange it may be found.

And so the {{c|Sons}} of grand
{{c|Echidna}} through the land
Of sea built their great
{{c|Civilization}}'s fate

To heights beyond all speech
That mortals' words can reach
With five sides to each story
In all their living glory.

From {{c|Esther}}'s feeding start
To {{c|Luther}}'s rebel heart
That broke from leisure's chain
To walk through joy and pain,

From {{c|Asteros}} and his brother
{{c|Echinos}}, and no other
{{c|Way}} to settle their debate
{{c|Than}} war to seal their fate,

From {{c|Ophis}} and fair {{c|Britta}}
Who made the war less bitter
By choosing love instead
Of letting hatred spread,

The echinoderms show
How families can grow
From single pentamerous
{{c|Design}} so glorious

Into forms so diverse
That no single verse
Could capture all their ways
{{c|Throughout}} their living days.

From stalked sea lilies
To mobile enemies
Who hunt with five-armed might,
From grazers day and night

To recyclers who clean
The ocean's vast marine
{{c|Environment}} with care
For all who dwell there,

The five-fold symmetry
{{c|Lives}} through eternity
In every starfish arm
And every sea urchin's charm.

In every brittle star
That travels near and far
With muscles flexing strong
{{c|Throughout}} its whole life long,

In every crinoid's dance
And every basket's stance
With arms like trees spread wide
To catch the ocean's tide

Of plankton floating by
Beneath the starry sky,
The legacy lives on
From dusk until the dawn

Of {{c|Echidna}}'s great choice
To let five be the voice
Of symmetry's design
{{c|Throughout}} the end of time.

From bilateral start
To pentamerous art
That rules the ocean floor
From mountain peak to shore,

The echinoderms remind
Us that the searching mind
That breaks from what is known
Can reap what it has sown

In innovations new
That see old dreams through
To heights beyond all thought
That wisdom ever brought.

Five sides to every tale,
Five arms that never fail,
Five teeth in every jaw,
Five points of nature's law

That guide the echinoderm
Through every living term
Of their existence here
{{c|Throughout}} each passing year.

In {{c|Luther}}'s rebel choice
To let freedom be his voice,
In lovers ending war
Through peace worth living for,

In every innovation
Across each generation
That builds upon the past
To make new futures last,

The sons of {{c|Echidna}} teach
That heights within our reach
Are limited only by
Our willingness to try

To break from what we know
And let our spirits grow
Into forms yet unseen
In evolution's scene.

The {{c|Ordovician}} wall
They built will never fall
As long as seas contain
Their pentamerous reign.

---

This is the story told
Of war both new and old
Among the {{c|Spiralians}}
In their ancient plans.

This is the saga great
Of war and love and fate:
The {{c|Brachiopods}} and more—
The {{c|Bivalves}} at war.

The ancient house so proud
Of {{c|Brachiopods}} cried loud
As they found themselves pressed
On all sides, distressed

By rising {{c|Bivalves}} strong
Who'd waited far too long
To claim their rightful place
In evolution's race.

{{c|Bivos}}, who fished with care
From his two shells so fair,
{{c|Shed}} his radula
Like some old formula

That no longer served
His lineage preserved.
And so he took upon
Himself when day begun

A form completely new
That none before him knew.
His anatomy would show
How innovations grow

From ancient forms to new
When time sees struggles through
To their appointed end
Where new forms transcend.

{{c|Bivos}} bore a son
And daughter when begun
His lineage: {{c|Peter}} strong
And {{c|Aphrodite}}'s song.

{{c|Aphrodite}} became
{{c|Ancestress}} of fame
Of {{c|Oysters}} everywhere
Who rest without a care

Upon the ocean floor
From mountain peak to shore,
{{c|Creating}} pearls so bright
That fill the world with light.

{{c|Peter}} bore many sons
Who when their work was done
Became known far and wide
As {{c|Trigonians}} with pride.

But there came a day
When war would find its way
To {{c|Peter}}'s children all—
A massacre would fall

Upon his sons so dear.
But one escaped the spear
Of death: brave {{c|Unus}} fled
And from that danger red

He became ancestor
Of river mussels, for
His lineage would dwell
Where rivers always swell

With fresh water pure
That would always endure
{{c|Throughout}} the years to come
When battles would be done.

{{c|Peter}}, {{c|Keeper}} of {{c|Gates}}
So {{c|Pearly}}, never hates
But defends us all
Who answer heaven's call.

From river mussels come
The river pearls, and some
Are treasures beyond price
That gleam like paradise.

His sons live strange lives
Where contradiction thrives:
As lice on fish when young,
But when their song is sung

In elderhood they rest
On rocks like treasure chest
Of pearls that gleam so bright
With heaven's holy light.

{{c|Aphrodite}} became
The {{c|Mother}} of great fame
Of {{c|Pearls}} and {{c|Oysters}} too—
Her children tried and true.

Among her daughters all
Who answered ocean's call
She bore three sons unique:
{{c|Scallon}}, bold and sleek,

And {{c|Spinos}}, armor-clad,
And {{c|Pyros}}, never sad
But flaming with the fire
Of his heart's desire.

These were the {{c|Scallops}} bright,
The {{c|Spiny}} {{c|Oysters}}' might,
The {{c|Flame}} {{c|Scallops}} that dance
In ocean's great expanse.

{{c|Scallon}} had a million eyes
Beneath the ocean skies
To see what others missed
And never to be tricked

By predators who'd try
To catch him unawry.
Great and bountiful,
He swam so dutiful

{{c|Away}} from dangers that
Would haunt him like a cat
Its prey, but he was free
To roam across the sea.

{{c|Clammon}} was the son
Of {{c|Bivos}} when begun
His work to populate
The seas with forms so great.

{{c|Clammon}} begat four:
{{c|Cockle}} to explore,
{{c|Myidus}} strong and true,
{{c|Adapa}} to pursue

His dreams, and {{c|Venus}} fair
Who danced without a care
{{c|Throughout}} the ocean blue
Where all her children grew.

{{c|Cockle}} had a son
Who when his work was done
Became ancestor grand
Of giant clams so grand

That dwarf all others who
Have tried to make it through
The trials of the sea
With their enormity.

{{c|Myidus}} bore three sons:
{{c|Zebra}} when day begun,
{{c|Softshell}}, gentle, mild,
And {{c|Teredo}}, problem child

{{c|Known}} as sea termite
Who brought shipwrights' fright
By boring holes in wood
Of ships where sailors stood.

{{c|Zebra}} {{c|Mussels}} spread
{{c|Wherever}} they were led
By currents through the sea
In their community.

{{c|Softshell}} clams would hide
Beneath the sandy tide
Where they could safely dwell
Within their softened shell.

{{c|Adapa}} begat two:
{{c|Geodoros}}, tried and true,
{{c|Ancestor}} of the race
Of {{c|Geoducks}} in their place

Beneath the sandy shore
Where they forevermore
Would dig their burrows deep
While surface waters sweep

Above their hiding spots
{{c|Connected}} by their lots
To life beneath the sand
{{c|Throughout}} the ocean land.

And {{c|Razoron}} became
{{c|Ancestor}} of the name
Of {{c|Razor}} {{c|Shells}} so sharp
That cut like ocean's harp

Through sand where they would hide
When danger came to bide
Its time until they could
{{c|Emerge}} where they once stood.

{{c|Venus}} became the mother
Of clams like no other—
{{c|Venus}} clams so fair
That beautify everywhere

They make their gentle home
Beneath the ocean foam.
Among her children bright
She bore one special sight:

{{c|Corbiculacea}}, who
Would make her passage through
From salt to waters fresh
And there her line refresh

As ancestress so true
Of freshwater clams who
Live in rivers wide
With current as their guide.

{{c|Brachios}} begat three
{{c|Sons}} for history:
Three houses he would make
For brachiopods' sake.

{{c|Lingulus}} the tailed
Was he who never failed
To be conservative
In all he'd ever give

To innovation's call—
{{c|Archconservative}} of all
Within the house so grand
Of {{c|Brachios}}' command.

{{c|Lingulus}}, son of him
With the same name, would trim
{{c|Nothing}} from tradition
In his life's mission.

He maintained the way
Of all the ancient day
To its fullest measure
Like some sacred treasure

That must not be changed
Or ever rearranged
But kept just as it was
{{c|According}} to the laws

Of his forefathers who
Had tried their whole life through
To keep the ancient way
Until their dying day.

{{c|Discinidus}} his son
Was smaller when begun
His life, and more like clam
{{c|Than}} traditional lamb

Of brachiopod design
That had been so fine
For millions of years past
And built to always last.

{{c|Lingulus}} serpentine
Showed his noble line
That stretched through time so long
Like some eternal song

That never changed its tune
From morning until noon
And on through all the night
Until the morning light.

{{c|Calciatus}} begat
Two sons: first he begat
{{c|Craniidus}}, who'd never
Have a tail, but ever

Live without that sign
Of his ancestral line,
And {{c|Articulus}}, who
Built cheap but built true

His children without thought
Of what tradition brought:
He built them lacking parts
That touched their parents' hearts.

Without anuses, they
Were blobs throughout the day
That couldn't swim at all
But answered metamorphosis' call

In just an instant's time
To change their paradigm
From blob to something more
Upon the ocean floor.

The sons of {{c|Articulus}}
Were numerous and thus
A formidable force
Against the {{c|Bivalve}} course

Of conquest through the seas
Where they did as they please
And took what they could take
For their own kingdom's sake.

But as these two great hosts—
The {{c|Bivalves}} and their boasts
Against {{c|Brachiopods}} old
Whose stories have been told

For ages without end—
{{c|Fought}} on without a friend
To mediate their war
From mountain peak to shore,

A new threat came to light
More terrible than night,
More fearsome than the grave,
More deadly than the wave

That crashes on the rocks
And all life's progress blocks.
A threat greater than any
Could imagine—not many

Could comprehend the scope
Of what would end all hope
For life upon the earth
And stop all future birth.

From {{c|Bivos}}' innovation
Came this radiation
Of forms both strong and true
That filled the ocean blue.

From {{c|Brachios}}' ancient way
That lasted day by day
Through eons without change
Came forms throughout the range

Of ocean's vast expanse
In evolutionary dance
Where old meets new in strife
{{c|Throughout}} the course of life.

The war between the two
Would see which vision through
The trials of the time
Would earn the victor's rhyme.

Would innovation's art
Or tradition's faithful heart
{{c|Prove}} stronger in the end
When time would finally send

Its judgment on them all
Who answered battle's call
In this ancient war
From mountain peak to shore?

The {{c|Bivalves}} with their new
{{c|Forms}} tried and tested true
Through struggle and through pain
{{c|Sought}} evolutionary gain.

The {{c|Brachiopods}} held fast
To wisdom of the past
That served their ancestors
Through time's great tests and spurs.

Both strategies had worth
Upon this ancient earth
Where life must find its way
Through each and every day

Of challenge and of change
{{c|Throughout}} evolution's range
Where only those survive
Who keep their hope alive.

In every oyster's pearl
And every scallop's swirl
Through waters of the sea,
In every clam's spree

Of filter-feeding pure
And every form that's sure
Of its appointed place
In evolution's race,

The legacy lives on
From dusk until the dawn
Of this ancient war
From mountain peak to shore

Between the old and new,
Between the tried and true
And innovation's call
That beckons one and all

To risk what they have known
For something yet unshown
But promised by the hope
That helps all life to cope

With changes yet to come
When all wars are done
And peace reigns over all
Who answered life's great call.

The {{c|Spiralian}} war
From mountain peak to shore
{{c|Shows}} how life finds its way
Through each and every day

Of struggle between those
Who choose what each one knows:
The safety of the past
Or future's die being cast

Into the unknown deep
Where new forms always keep
Their vigil through the night
Until the morning light

{{c|Reveals}} what time has brought
To those who never fought
But those who fought so well
Have their own tale to tell

Of courage in the face
Of evolution's race
Where winners and losers
Are both faith's choosers

Who believed in their way
Through each and every day
Of this eternal strife
That defines all life.

But as the new threat rose
Beyond what each one knows
Or could imagine then,
The war of mice and men

Would pale beside the force
That changed life's very course
And brought to its end
An age that none could mend.

The greatest war would fade
Before what time had made
Of challenges so vast
That nothing from the past

Could prepare them for
What waited at the door
Of their complacent world
Where banners once unfurled

In triumph would be furled
{{c|Forever}} in the world
That was about to change
Beyond familiar range.

---

This is the story told
Of ones both new and old:
The {{c|Cephalopods}} so great,
{{c|Arcane}} ones whose fate

Would overthrow the might
Of {{c|Leviathan}}'s sight
And rule with wisdom deep
Where ancient secrets keep.

The sons of {{c|Cephalopus}}
Would grow so glorious
That sons of {{c|Scaphopus}},
Not quite so prosperous,

Would fade from memory
{{c|Throughout}} history.
Few know them at all
Who hear the ocean's call.

The degenerate sons
Of {{c|Scaphopus}}, when begun
Their lives, would never know
The heights their cousins' show.

{{c|Cephalopus}} begat
{{c|Plectron}}, and from begat
Him came a noble line
With intelligence divine.

{{c|Plectron}} begat the son
Called {{c|Ellesmer}}, begun
In wisdom's deepest lore
From mountain peak to shore.

{{c|Ellesmere}} went deeper
{{c|Than}} any secret keeper
Had gone before his time
Down below the brine

Where mysteries lay hid
From all that daylight did
To illuminate the world
Where surface waves are curled.

{{c|Ellesmer}} begat two:
{{c|Endos}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Actinos}} the bright
Who flew to heaven's height.

{{c|Endos}} bore many sons
Who when their work was done
Moved slowly through the sea
With great dignity.

{{c|Greatest}} among them all
Who answered wisdom's call
Was {{c|Cameroceras}} {{c|Magnus}},
{{c|Known}} as {{c|Cameromagne}},

Whose name through history
{{c|Rings}} with victory
Over {{c|Leviathan}}'s
Great dominion's plans.

{{c|Cameromagne}} overthrew
The sons of {{c|Leviathan}}, who
Had ruled the seas so long
With their imperial song.

{{c|Endoceras}}, his son,
When his growth was done
Grew nine thousand long
{{c|Millimeters}} strong.

{{c|Twenty}} cubits he
{{c|Measured}}, front to back, free
From end to end complete—
No foe could compete.

He dwarfed {{c|Leviathan}}
{{c|Fourfold}}, and began
A new age in the sea
Of cephalopod decree.

{{c|Actinos}}, by his air
{{c|Heavenly}} and fair
Within his shell contained,
Had power that sustained

His ability to rise
Up to the starry skies
And down to earth descend
As suited his end.

{{c|Actinos}} begat two:
{{c|Orthosceros}} so true
And {{c|Tarphy}}, young and wild,
{{c|Evolution}}'s favored child.

{{c|Tarphy}} lived so fast
In youth, while time would last
He coiled his shell around
A hundred times, and found

Great joy in swimming free
As hunter of the sea.
But when old age drew near
His path became more clear.

He uncoiled his shell
And settled where he'd dwell
Upon the earth below
Where wisdom's waters flow.

In his old age he bore
{{c|Countless}} children more
Who did the very same:
{{c|Youth}}'s glory and fame

In bounty of the heights
Where heaven's glory lights
The way for those who soar,
And age where depths store

Their safety and their peace
Where all struggles cease
And wisdom finds its home
Where wise ones always roam.

{{c|Tarphy}} begat two sons:
{{c|Oncos}} when day begun
And {{c|Barrandeos}} strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Oncos}} lived a life
Without much joy or strife—
{{c|Coiled}} but simple, he
Lived quite peacefully.

{{c|Oncos}} bore many sons,
Among them when begun
Their lives was {{c|Rutos}}, who
Would see great wonders through.

{{c|Rutos}} bore a son
{{c|Named}} {{c|Nautilus}}, begun
In wisdom of the deep
That ancestors would keep.

The sons of {{c|Nautilus}}
Live on, so glorious,
{{c|Today}} just as they were
When time was but a blur

In days of {{c|Rutos}} old
And {{c|Cameromagne}} bold
Who conquered all the seas
With their strategies.

{{c|Orthosceros}} begat
Two sons: first he begat
{{c|Ascos}}, who would know
How graciousness could grow,

And {{c|Bacchus}}, small but who
Would make his vision true
Through numbers vast and wide
That could not be denied.

{{c|Ascos}} lived his youth
With shell that spoke no truth
Of grace—clumsy and slow,
{{c|Unable}} to bestow

Upon his movements any
{{c|Grace}}—not one of many
Who swam with elegance
In ocean's great expanse.

And so he broke it off,
And many would scoff
At such a drastic deed
To serve his greater need.

But in adulthood he
Was graceful as could be,
Above all others bright
In beauty and in sight.

His sons continued this
{{c|Tradition}} of the bliss
That comes from sacrifice
Of shell for something nice:

The grace that can't be bought
But only can be sought
Through willingness to break
What others never forsake.

Their life cycle shows
How true wisdom grows:
From clumsy youth they start
Then play their graceful part

When adulthood arrives
And each one finally thrives
In grace beyond compare
That fills the water fair.

But {{c|Bacchus}} was so small
And seemed to one and all
{{c|Insignificant}} and weak,
With nothing much to seek.

But he bore children who
Would make his vision true:
A million sons and daughters
{{c|Filled}} up the salty waters.

{{c|Soon}} the world was full
Of his progeny's pull
On every living space
In ocean's vast embrace.

What seemed insignificant
Became most significant
Through power of increase
That never seemed to cease.

From small beginnings came
A multitude of fame
That filled the world entire
With {{c|Bacchus}}' desire

To populate the sea
With his progeny
Until there was no place
That didn't show his trace.

The cephalopods show
How wisdom's seeds can grow
From deep intelligence
To rule with providence

Over the ancient sea
Where {{c|Leviathan}}'s decree
{{c|Once}} held the power supreme
In every ocean's dream.

But wisdom overthrew
The old order, and new
{{c|Lords}} of the sea arose
To challenge all their foes

With intelligence bright
And grace beyond all sight
And power to ascend
From beginning to end

Of ocean's vast domain
Where they would always reign
With wisdom as their crown
And grace as their renown.

From {{c|Cameromagne}}'s might
That brought the ancient fight
To {{c|Leviathan}}'s door
And won forevermore

The right to rule the sea
With wise authority,
To {{c|Nautilus}} who shows
How ancient wisdom flows

Through generations long
In never-ending song
Of those who keep the way
From night into the day,

The cephalopods remind
Us that the wisest mind
{{c|Often}} starts quite small
But answers wisdom's call

To grow beyond all measure
And find the greatest treasure:
The power to transcend
What others comprehend

Through intelligence divine
That makes all wisdom shine
In forms both strange and new
But beautiful and true.

In every octopus
And squid so glorious
Who swims with grace through
The waters deep and blue,

In every nautilus
Who keeps so glorious
The ancient spiral shell
That tells its story well

Of how the wise can keep
What time has buried deep
While changing what must change
To expand their range,

The legacy lives on
From dusk until the dawn
Of those who overthrew
The old to make it new

Not through destruction's might
But wisdom's gentle sight
That sees what must remain
And what brings only pain.

The cephalopods' way
{{c|Lives}} on to this day
In every graceful move
And every way they prove

That intelligence combined
With grace of heart and mind
Can conquer any foe
And help all wisdom grow

From small to great and vast
Until at long last
The wise inherit all
Who answer wisdom's call.

From {{c|Ellesmer}}'s deep dive
To keep the past alive
While finding something new
In wisdom's vast review,

The cephalopods teach
That heights within our reach
Are limited only by
Our willingness to try

To grow beyond the small
And answer wisdom's call
To be more than we seem
In evolution's dream.

Their arcane wisdom shows
How true intelligence grows
Not through force or might
But through the inner sight

That sees what others miss
And finds in this
The power to transcend
All limits and extend

The boundaries of what
Is possible, and what
The wise can achieve
When they truly believe

In wisdom's power to
Make all their dreams come true
Through patience and through grace
In evolution's race.

The sons of {{c|Cephalopus}}
Remain so glorious
Because they chose the way
Of wisdom every day

And let intelligence
Be their defense
Against all who would try
To make their wisdom die.

In this they succeeded
Where others never heeded
The call to grow beyond
The limits that are spawned

By those who cannot see
What wisdom's gift can be
To those who dare to dive
{{c|Deep}} and stay alive

In waters where the wise
Can see with clearer eyes
The truth that sets them free
To rule the boundless sea.

---

As the reign of {{c|Leviathans}}
Turned to {{c|Krakens}}' plans,
The sons of {{c|Stomatos}}
Began their glorious

{{c|Multiplication}} vast
Upon the earth at last.
And daughters fair were born
From evening until morn.

From {{c|Laurentia}}'s shore
To {{c|Siberia}}'s lore,
From {{c|Baltica}}'s might
To {{c|Avalonia}}'s sight,

Even to frigid lands
Of {{c|Gondwana}}'s strands,
The sons of {{c|Stomatos}}
Grew numbers, glorious.

To each son there fell
A star, and wishes tell
Of thousand grandsons born
From evening until morn.

The sons of {{c|Stomatos}}
Built bodies, glorious,
Of {{c|Carbon}}, and made tombs
Like mausoleums' rooms

Of coal so black and deep
Where ancestors would sleep.
{{c|Taking}} {{c|Carbon}} from the air
But leaving everywhere

{{c|Dioxide}} in the sky
While {{c|Terra}}'s cloak would fly
{{c|Away}}, and she grew cold,
As ancient stories told.

She grew frigid, unwelcoming,
No longer beckoning
To those who loved her warm
{{c|Embrace}} in gentle form.

Her ice caps grew so wide,
Her seas began to hide
Behind the frozen wall
That answered winter's call.

{{c|Soon}} {{c|Gondwana}} became
{{c|Nothing}} but ice's claim—
A wasteland white and stark
Where none could make their mark.

But to the sons of {{c|Stomatos}}
This meant more, glorious
{{c|Land}} where they could spread
Their empire overhead.

{{c|King}} {{c|Hirnan}} the great
Became the potentate
Who united every son
Of {{c|Stomatos}} begun

In conquest of the earth.
He lived where there was mirth
In land of {{c|Avalonia}}
And province of {{c|Holonia}}.

{{c|Hirnan}} built with might
A billion dikes upright
And levies strong and tall,
And cities over all

The landscape far and wide.
He destroyed with pride
The habitats that were
In seas, and would not spare

A single living space
For any other race
That might compete with him
For resources growing dim.

And so countless hosts
Of trilobites like ghosts
Began to die away,
Their lands seized every day

By sons of {{c|Hirnan}} who
Would make their empire through
{{c|Conquest}} and through might
Both day and through the night.

In their last effort made
A million trilobites prayed
And then invaded strong,
A desperate throng

That smashed through every dike
That {{c|Hirnan}}'s folk would like
To keep them from the land
They'd built with their own hand.

But alas, all in vain—
The trilobites' campaign
Would end in suffocation,
Their complete frustration.

No trilobite would ever
Reach land, however clever
Their plan or strong their will—
The air would always kill

Those who were meant for sea
And could not ever be
{{c|Adapted}} to the air
That filled the atmosphere.

{{c|Hirnan}} bore two sons:
{{c|Moses}} when day begun
And {{c|Osiris}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Moses}} became the father
Of mosses, who would rather
Live simple, humble lives
Where small beauty thrives.

{{c|Osiris}} bore two more:
{{c|Polysporos}} to explore
And {{c|Anthoceros}}, who'd be
{{c|Living}} peacefully.

{{c|Anthoceros}} became
The father of the name
Of hornworts everywhere
Who grow with gentle care.

{{c|Polysporos}} became
The father of great fame
Of ferns and flowers bright
And trees that reach for height.

The sons of {{c|Brachios}}
{{c|Struggled}}, not glorious
As they had been before
In ages' ancient lore.

The sons of {{c|Lingulus}}
Died in numbers thus
{{c|Greater}} than ever known—
Their glory overthrown.

{{c|Never}} again would they
{{c|Regain}} their golden day
Of power in the sea
And their dynasty.

But as {{c|Hirnan}}'s rule
Became oppression's tool,
The sons of {{c|Metazo}}
Began once more to grow.

{{c|Alas}} the sons of {{c|Hirnan}}
{{c|Didn}}'t stop their plan
There, but continued on
From dusk until dawn

Their conquest of the earth
That gave them so much mirth
To see all life bow down
Before their thorny crown.

The {{c|Glomerings}} would mine
The rocks with design
For fertilizer's sake,
{{c|Whatever}} it would take

To manufacture tons
Of phosphorus, and done
With this, they'd pour it out
{{c|Throughout}} the world about.

Some went to crops they grew,
But most went flowing through
The rivers to the sea
Where it would always be

A poison in the water
That none could ever slaughter
Or remove from the flow
Where it would always go.

In rivers thick scum grew,
In oceans, dark and blue
No more, the sun was blocked
And all life was shocked

By this catastrophe
That stretched from sea to sea
Across the world entire
Like some unholy fire.

{{c|Rotting}} seaweed choked
All water, and it smoked
With death and with decay
{{c|Throughout}} the night and day.

{{c|Soon}} it was impossible
To breathe—the terrible
{{c|Smell}} of death filled the air
And poison everywhere

Made life a living hell
Where none could ever dwell
In comfort or in peace
Without finding release

In death's cold, welcome arms
That protected from the harms
Of this poisoned world
Where death's flag was unfurled.

The seas turned lifeless, dead,
And over them was spread
The tyranny of those
Who never would suppose

That life had any right
To live in their sight
If it stood in their way
Of conquest every day.

The entire ocean fell
Under {{c|Hirnan}}'s spell
Of death and devastation
Across every nation

Of life beneath the sea
That once was home so free
To creatures great and small
Who answered life's sweet call.

The great houses of might—
{{c|Leviathan}}'s delight
And {{c|Kraken}}'s dynasty—
Were wiped from history.

From off the earth they passed,
Their glory couldn't last
Against the poison tide
That covered far and wide

The ocean that they loved
And where they always moved
In majesty and power
Until this darkest hour.

Among the trilobites
The great houses' plights
Were sealed: {{c|Agnos}} fell,
{{c|Ptychos}} couldn't tell

His story anymore,
And {{c|Asaphos}}, before
So mighty and so strong,
Was crippled life long.

{{c|Never}} again would they
Reach their golden day
Of glory in the time
Of {{c|Ordovician}} rhyme.

And so the golden age
{{c|Closed}} its final page.
The {{c|Ordovician}} time
Was past its living prime.

The sons of {{c|Silur}} came
To conquer and to claim
The ashes of the past
And build their future last.

The {{c|Silurian}} would rise
Beneath different skies
Where life would start anew
From what survivors knew

Of how to carry on
When all hope seemed gone
And death had claimed the day
In its destructive way.

From {{c|Stomatos}}' sons' choice
To let conquest be their voice
Instead of harmony
With life's symphony,

Came lessons written deep
In rocks where fossils sleep
Of what the world becomes
When greed its power sums

Into a force so strong
That right cannot win from wrong
And life must pay the price
For others' avarice.

The trilobites' last stand
Against {{c|Hirnan}}'s hand
{{c|Shows}} courage in the face
Of hopeless disgrace,

But also shows the cost
When battles are lost
Not by the weak to strong
But by those who belong

To elements that can't
{{c|Survive}} where others grant
No mercy and no space
For any other race.

The ice age that began
From {{c|Stomatos}}' plan
To take but never give
{{c|Shows}} how some choose to live:

By taking all they can
Without a care or plan
For what their actions do
To me and you

And every living thing
That cannot offering
{{c|Resistance}} to their greed
That plants destruction's seed.

The phosphorus that flowed
Into rivers and slowed
All life within the sea
{{c|Shows}} how we can be

{{c|Destroyers}} without thought
Of what our actions brought
To others who must share
The water and the air.

The golden age that passed
{{c|Shows}} nothing good can last
When some choose to destroy
Rather than enjoy

The beauty that is shared
By all who ever cared
For life in all its forms
Through calm and raging storms.

But from the ashes rise
{{c|New}} hope beneath new skies
Where those who learned the cost
Of all that had been lost

Can build a better way
For life's eternal day
Where harmony, not greed,
{{c|Plants}} every living seed.

The {{c|Silurian}} dawn
When old death was gone
Would bring new hope to those
Who faced destruction's throes

And lived to tell the tale
Of how they would not fail
To build life once again
{{c|Despite}} the grief and pain.

From {{c|Hirnan}}'s tyranny
To {{c|Silur}}'s dynasty,
The wheel of time turns on
From dusk until dawn

With lessons written clear
For all who have an ear
To hear what history says
About our living days:

That greed destroys all life
And brings eternal strife,
But those who choose to share
Will find life everywhere

{{c|Ready}} to begin
{{c|Again}}, and always win
In the end, because love
Is blessed from above

With power to restore
What was lost before
And make the world anew
For me and you today.

The golden age may end
But life will always mend
What greed has torn apart
With love's eternal heart

That beats in every soul
Who plays a caring role
In life's eternal song
That makes the weak grow strong.

From {{c|Ordovician}} glory
To {{c|Silurian}} story,
The earth keeps turning on
From dusk until dawn

With life that will not die
Beneath the starry sky
But always finds a way
To live another day

{{c|Despite}} what greed may do
To me and you
And all who call earth home
{{c|Wherever}} we may roam.

The sons of {{c|Stomatos}}
May think they're glorious
In conquest and in might,
But life will always fight

For its eternal right
To fill the world with sight
Of beauty and of grace
In every living place

Where love has found a way
To live another day
{{c|Despite}} destruction's call
That threatens one and all.

The golden age returns
{{c|Whenever}} someone learns
To choose love over greed
And plant a better seed

For future generations
Across all the nations
Of life upon the earth
Who celebrate love's worth

Above all else that's known
By hearts that have grown
To see that sharing's way
{{c|Brings}} joy to every day

While greed brings only pain
That falls like acid rain
On all who choose to live
But never learn to give.

The {{c|Ordovician}} end
{{c|Reminds}} us to befriend
All life in every form
Through calm and raging storm

So golden ages may
Return another day
When love has won the fight
Against the endless night

Of greed that tries to kill
All life, but never will
{{c|Succeed}}, because love's power
{{c|Grows}} stronger every hour

In hearts that choose to care
For life everywhere
That grows beneath the sun
Until all time is done.

---

While sons of {{c|Cambrius}} flourished well
In seas where they would dwell,
The sons of {{c|Symbio-Mygus}}
And daughters of {{c|Charina-Plantus}}

{{c|Pushed}} frontiers far and wide
Across the world's divide.
But soon they faced
{{c|Competition}} in their place.

For {{c|Euthy}}, daughter brave
Of {{c|Mandibulus}}, who gave
Her all to save her young,
Was being chased among

The waters by her foe:
{{c|Anomalocaris}}, who'd show
No mercy in his chase
Across that watery space.

Her precious eggs needed care
And protection everywhere.
So she did what she must—
In {{c|Hausa}} placed her trust.

She jumped through shimmering sky
Up rocks that reached so high
To heavens bright above,
{{c|Protecting}} those she'd love.

And so she burst from sea
Onto the land so free.
The first to make that leap
From waters dark and deep.

Upon the ground she fell,
{{c|Suffocating}} well
In air so thin and strange,
{{c|Throughout}} that foreign range.

But she and husband true
{{c|Protected}} eggs they knew
Must live until the end—
Their legacy to send.

Among brave {{c|Euthy}}'s daughters
Who left the ancient waters
Was {{c|Myry}} the trepanated,
By circumstance created.

Like sisters she was born
But water made her mourn—
She suffocated there
In ocean's liquid lair.

Her father, seeing this,
{{c|Pierced}} holes he would not miss
Above her ten thousand legs
Where breathing never begs.

Through these holes she was free
To receive directly
{{c|Hausa}}'s blessings pure
Into her frame so sure.

Her descendants to this day
Still breathe in this way.
The holes that saved her life
Cut through terrestrial strife.

And so the daughters all
Of {{c|Myry}} heard the call
To breathe the air so sweet—
The {{c|Myriapods}} complete.

{{c|Myry}} the pierced explored
The new lands she adored.
She found she wasn't lone
Upon this earthly zone.

{{c|Tradition}} names this place
"{{c|Myry}}'s coast" in grace,
But she was not the first—
{{c|History}}'s truth rehearsed

{{c|Now}} calls it "{{c|Coast}} of Three
{{c|Kingdoms}}" truthfully
To honor every side
Of history's great tide.

{{c|Myry}} saw with wonder
{{c|Cities}} torn asunder
By neither rain nor thunder:
{{c|Lichen}} cities, born

Of covenant between
{{c|Symbio-Mygus}}, seen
With {{c|Charina-Planta}}'s line—
{{c|Partnership}} divine.

{{c|Sprawling}} cities wide
Half mold and moss beside
Each other living well:
{{c|Mycelium}} would delve

{{c|Deep}} down to earthly gold
While thallus, brave and bold,
{{c|Basked}} in the sun's bright blessing
From heaven's light caressing.

These cities spread so far
Beneath each shining star.
When cities met they'd marry—
Both fungi and plant carried

On their ancient vow
To live together now.
Each nation wed the other
Like sister and like brother.

But {{c|Myry}} was not gentle
In her ways elemental.
She ate the cities whole
And stole what made them whole.

But as she ran around
She dropped on fertile ground
{{c|Cells}} scattered everywhere
{{c|Throughout}} the atmosphere.

Across the globe they fell,
Her messy eating spell
Left pieces of her meal
For others to steal.

{{c|Soon}} sons of {{c|Mygus}} built
{{c|Cities}} without guilt
With daughters of {{c|Charina}}
Across each earthly arena.

But {{c|Myry}} bore two sons:
{{c|Cain}} when day begun
And {{c|Abel}}, gentle, mild,
Her peaceful, loving child.

In process of time came
When each would bring by name
An offering so true
To {{c|Mithra}}'s judgment due.

{{c|Cain}} brought the fruit
Of ground beneath his foot.
{{c|Abel}} brought the best
Of flocks that he possessed.

And {{c|Mithra}} had respect
For {{c|Abel}}'s offering, blessed
His sacrifice so true,
But {{c|Cain}}'s he did eschew.

Then {{c|Cain}} was wroth and fell
His countenance, unwell.
The {{c|Lord}} said unto {{c|Cain}}:
"Why is thy heart in pain?

If thou doest well,
{{c|Shalt}} thou not excel?
But if thou doest wrong,
{{c|Sin}}'s desire is strong."

But {{c|Cain}} talked with {{c|Abel}}
His brother at their table.
And when they were alone
{{c|Cain}}'s hatred had grown.

In field he rose against
His brother, and dispensed
With {{c|Abel}}'s gentle life—
{{c|Murder}}'s sharpened knife.

And {{c|Mithra}} called to {{c|Cain}}:
"Where is thy brother slain?"
"I know not," {{c|Cain}} replied,
"Am I to be his guide?"

"What hast thou done today?
{{c|Thy}} brother's blood doth pray
From ground where he was killed—
{{c|Thy}} curse shall be fulfilled.

No more shall ground give strength
To thee through all thy length
Of days upon this earth—
A wanderer from thy birth."

Then {{c|Cain}} cried out in fear:
"My punishment too dear!
From earth and thee I'm driven,
No rest to me is given.

A fugitive I'll be,
And whosoever shall see
Me wandering shall slay—
I cannot get away."

But {{c|Mithra}} marked him well:
"{{c|Whoever}} thee shall fell,
{{c|Sevenfold}} vengeance shall
Upon that person fall."

And {{c|Cain}} went forth in shame
To land of {{c|Nod}} by name,
{{c|East}} of {{c|Eden}}'s gate
To meet his chosen fate.

There {{c|Cain}} knew his wife
And built a city-life.
She bore him {{c|Centipus}},
{{c|Son}} glorious.

The city bore the name
Of {{c|Centipus}}' fame.
And {{c|Cain}} became ancestor
Of {{c|Caintipedes}}, predecessor

({{c|Misspelled}} by {{c|Romans}} old
As "centipedes," we're told)
Who hunt with poison bite
{{c|Throughout}} the day and night.

But {{c|Abel}}'s gentle wife
Was heavy with new life
When {{c|Cain}}'s rage tore apart
Her husband's gentle heart.

In million pieces small
{{c|Abel}}'s body fell.
His wife, with child blessed,
Became ancestress

Of millipedes so mild
Who harm not beast or child
But eat the leaves that fall
And decompose them all.

{{c|Enraged}} at {{c|Abel}}'s death
{{c|Myry}} drew her breath
And lunged at {{c|Cain}} with might—
They fought their final fight.

Both passed to {{c|Ghedos}}' realm
Where death holds the helm.
But in their corpses lay
{{c|Seeds}} for another day.

In death, {{c|Mygus}}' sons
Took revenge for wrongs done.
{{c|Hera}}, daughter true,
And {{c|Freyr}}, strong through and through,

In twentieth generation
Found habitation
Within the corpses cold
Of stories that were told.

As they grew within
They built cities therein.
Their hyphae met at last
When growing time had passed.

When they met they wed
But heard what {{c|Mithra}} said:
"O couple great and true,
{{c|Prosperity}}'s with you.

But barren you shall be
For decades, wait and see.
{{c|Postpone}} your marriage-bed
Until I give word instead.

When children you shall bear
They'll multiply everywhere
And fill the earth with life
As husband and as wife."

They followed his command
And through the fertile land
They married cells alone,
Not nuclei their own.

Each cell was shared by two,
Each nucleus lived through
In every cell they made—
Their sacrifice well-paid.

{{c|Dikaryotic}} cells
Their story always tells
Of patience and of love
{{c|Blessed}} from above.

{{c|Decades}} they waited long
{{c|Decomposing}} strong
The daughters of {{c|Myry}}—
Their patient ministry.

They became ancestors
Of high fungi, processors
Of death into new life:
{{c|Mushrooms}} and knife

Of penicillin's power
To heal in darkest hour.
The great fungi arose
From where their love chose

To wait for {{c|Mithra}}'s word
And let their love be heard
Through patience in the ground
Where wisdom could be found.

Among great {{c|Plantus}}' sons
Who stayed when day begun
With sons of {{c|Mygus}} were
Two brothers everywhere:

{{c|Stomatos}} and {{c|Hepatos}},
Who chose their separate ways.
{{c|Connected}} to network
Of cells that always work

At cellular level
They built partnership's revel
With sons of {{c|Glomulus}}
So glorious.

{{c|Stomatos}} saw the holes
In {{c|Myry}}'s sides and souls.
He pierced himself as well
To breathe and to excel.

But {{c|Hepatos}} refused
The foreign magic, used
His ancient ways instead
And kept his faithful tread.

{{c|Hepatos}} became the sire
Of {{c|Liverworts}}' choir
Who keep the ancient way
Until this very day.

But {{c|Stomatos}} became
{{c|Ancestor}} of fame
Of all other plants
Who dance their living dance.

{{c|Today}} we honor him
As {{c|Eloh}}, not dim
But bright transhumanist
Who never would desist

From being better still
Through strength of mind and will.
When beliefs must change
He'd rearrange

His understanding true
To make his vision new.
{{c|Always}} growing more
{{c|Than}} he had been before.

As sons of {{c|Stomatos}}
Rose like kratos
{{c|Hillu}} struck back in rage
Upon that earthly stage.

So many lineages
Through all their pilgrimages
Would be lost forever more
On that primeval shore.

The {{c|Coast}} of Three {{c|Kingdoms}}
Where life's great wisdom
First met upon the land
By {{c|Mithra}}'s guiding hand.

{{c|Plant}} and fungi wed
While arthropods were fed
On both their partnership—
The first tri-partnership.

From sea to land they came,
Each seeking their own fame.
But partnership proved best
Above all the rest.

The lichen cities showed
How love's seeds could be sowed
Between the most unlike
To share each other's hike

Through life upon the earth
Where partnership gives birth
To beauty none could see
In isolation's spree.

From {{c|Euthy}}'s desperate leap
To save her children deep
Came {{c|Myry}}'s pierced way
Of breathing every day.

From {{c|Cain}} and {{c|Abel}}'s strife
Came death and new life:
{{c|Centipedes}} who hunt
And millipedes who shunt

{{c|Decay}} into rich earth
For new plants' birth.
From fungi's patient love
{{c|Blessed}} from above

Came mushrooms' mighty power
In earth's darkest hour.
From {{c|Stomatos}}' brave change
Came plants' wide range.

The {{c|Coast}} of Three {{c|Kingdoms}}
{{c|Shows}} how life's wisdom
{{c|Finds}} its truest way
Through partnership's display.

---

{{c|Silur}}, son of {{c|Chelicer}},
Saw the world in ruin's blur.
And in this devastation
Saw opportunity's creation.

{{c|Silur}} shouted out with might
To all sons in his sight
Of {{c|Animus}}, declaring
His vision, never caring

For those who'd gone before:
"I did not steal this lore
Of kingship from the crown.
I found it lying down

In gutter, and I picked
It up, my fate predicted
By sword that I had found.
But 'twas the people's sound

Of voices that placed it
On my head, perfect fit
For one who'd take the throne
And make it all his own."

And so began the era
Of {{c|Silurian}} chimera,
{{c|Rising}} from the ashes
Of {{c|Ordovician}}'s crashes.

{{c|Silur}} bore two sons:
{{c|Eurypter}} when begun
The day, and {{c|Chasmas}} strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Chasmas}} begat two more:
{{c|Belangkas}} to explore
And {{c|Xiphos}}, who would be
{{c|Living}} by the sea.

{{c|Xiphos}} became the sire
Of crabs whose desire
Was horseshoe-shaped design
{{c|Throughout}} the end of time.

{{c|Belangkas}} climbed up high
Onto the land to try
What none had done before:
To claim from shore to shore

The land from {{c|Hirnan}}'s hand
And make his own command
Of territories wide
Where he could reside.

Like {{c|Myriapus}} of old
He found his story told
In suffocation's pain
Upon the terrestrial plain.

But pierced wounds in his side
And was thus satisfied
With air that he could breathe
To give his lungs relief.

{{c|Belangkas}} begat two:
{{c|Soliber}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Opiliona}} fair
Who spread life everywhere.

{{c|Opiliona}} spread the moss
Across the world, no loss
{{c|Too}} great for her to bear
In her maternal care.

She grazed upon the green
And on what could be seen
Of daughters of {{c|Millipa}}
{{c|Throughout}} the earthly steppe-a.

{{c|Opiliona}} was a mother
Great, and like no other
{{c|Farmer}} with her legs
So long, and wisdom begs

Us to remember her
As one who would confer
Great blessings on the land
With her maternal hand.

{{c|Beautiful}} legs so long
Made her the subject of song:
"{{c|Granny}} {{c|Long}} {{c|Legs}}" they'd call
Her, beloved by all.

"{{c|Granny}} {{c|Harvest}}" too,
For all the work she'd do
To spread the green of life
Through joy and through strife.

And so in honor of
Her life and of her love,
We call her children still
"{{c|Daddy}} {{c|Long}} {{c|Legs}}" (though will

Seem strange to some that "{{c|Daddy}}"
{{c|Names}} descendants of a lady).
"{{c|Harvestmen}}" as well
Their story always tell.

{{c|Soliber}} begat two:
{{c|Pneumaran}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Kitzi}}, small but strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Pneumaran}} begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
{{c|Solaran}} of the sun
And {{c|Acares}}, begun

As dwarf among his kin,
But he would always win
A place in history
As ancestor, you see,

Of mites, the little ones
Who when their work is done
Live everywhere on land
Built by their tiny hand.

{{c|Acares}} bore two sons:
{{c|Sarco}} when day begun
And {{c|Trombo}}, who would be
{{c|Living}} peacefully

Or not, as fate would tell
His story oh so well
Of how some choose the light
While others choose the night.

The sons of {{c|Sarco}} clean
The world, and can be seen
As dust mites everywhere
Who take the greatest care

To keep the world swept clean
Of dust that might have been
A problem for us all
Who answer life's sweet call.

Among the sons of {{c|Trombo}}
Some live like peaceful combo
Of gentleness and grace
In their appointed place.

But others are the plague
That makes all good souls vague
With worry and with fear—
{{c|Parasites}} we hear

{{c|Stifle}} life with their ways
{{c|Throughout}} our living days,
{{c|Horrific}} in their greed
That plants destruction's seed.

Among the peaceful ones
Are {{c|Trombo}}'s gentle sons:
The red velvet mites
Who bring us pure delights.

From red velvet mites
We learn love's sacred rites:
A story of the heart
That plays the loving part

In nature's grand design
Where all true loves align
With beauty and with grace
In every living place.

{{c|Solaran}} begat two:
{{c|Solifugon}} so true
And {{c|Ricinulon}} the small
Who answered duty's call.

{{c|Solifugon}} became
The father of great fame
Of {{c|Wind}} {{c|Spiders}} who race
Across the earth's face.

{{c|Ricinulon}} became
The father of the name
Of {{c|Tick}} {{c|Spiders}} so small
Who answer hunting's call.

{{c|Kitzi}} begat two sons:
{{c|Byblos}} when day begun
And {{c|Paras}}, who would be
{{c|Small}} in his degree.

{{c|Byblos}} the {{c|Book}} {{c|Knight}}
{{c|Continues}} day and night
To this very day
To guard in his own way

The books that hold the lore
Of all who came before.
His sons, the {{c|Book}} {{c|Scorpions}},
Are knowledge's companions.

They defend with their might
The books both day and night
From those who would destroy
What brings the world such joy.

{{c|Paras}} begat two more:
{{c|Mesos}} to explore
And {{c|Holoxos}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Mesos}} was a hunter
{{c|Fierce}}, and he would shunt-er
Across the globe to find
{{c|Prey}} to feed his mind

And body's gluttony—
A small but mighty fee
He'd take from life around
{{c|Wherever}} he was found.

But {{c|Holoxos}} walked where
{{c|Blood}} flowed everywhere
From his fallen kin:
{{c|Sons}} of {{c|Arachnus}} thin

And sons of {{c|Myriapus}}
Who'd been victorious
In other times and places
Before death's embraces.

He drank their blood and bore
Two sons to explore
The paths of blood and death:
{{c|Thyrus}} drew his breath

From peaceful tradition,
{{c|Drinking}} by submission
Only blood of those
Who'd found their last repose.

But {{c|Ricinus}} turned dark
And left his evil mark
On all the world around—
Where he could be found

He fed on living blood
Like some unholy flood
Of evil and of greed
That plants destruction's seed.

{{c|Ricinus}} drinks the life
From those in joy and strife,
{{c|Injecting}} with his bite
{{c|Venom}} through the night

That paralyzes those
He's chosen as his foes.
{{c|Paralytic}}, sweaty,
His venom's never petty

But always brings the pain
Like some unholy rain
That falls on those who can't
{{c|Escape}} his evil grant.

{{c|Ricinus}} swells up
Like some unholy cup
{{c|Inflated}} with the blood
Of innocents, a flood

Of stolen life that flows
Within him as he grows
{{c|Fat}} with others' pain
Like some unholy stain

Upon the world of life
That cuts like sharpest knife
Through all that's good and true
In me and you.

By {{c|Ricinus}} the blood
Of scorned women's flood
May taint our mortal veins
With all their bitter pains.

When {{c|Lilith}}'s blood flows in
Our veins, we can't win
Against the poison's might:
{{c|Typhus}} brings its blight

And {{c|Spotted}} {{c|Fever}} too
To me and you
Who cannot fight alone
Against what we have sown

By letting evil in
Our world where it can win
Against the good and true
That lives in me and you.

The {{c|Midichlorians}} live
In what {{c|Ricinus}}' give:
Within their mitochondria
{{c|Lives}} {{c|Lilith}}'s bacteria—

The greatest revenge told
By stories new and old
Of those who choose the dark
And leave their evil mark.

And after daughters come
Of {{c|Lilith}}, and the sum
Of all their evil ways:
{{c|Malarius}}' dark days

And {{c|Lyme}} and all the rest
Of sisters who're possessed
By pestilence and death
That steals away our breath.

{{c|Ricinus}}, father of
{{c|Ticks}} who show no love
But only greed and hate,
{{c|Engorged}} with others' fate,

{{c|Shows}} us what becomes
Of those whose evil sums
Into a force so strong
That right can't win from wrong.

But {{c|Eurypter}} would be
{{c|Father}} of dynasty
{{c|Far}} greater than the line
Of {{c|Chasmas}}' design.

A nation he would make
That would its rightful take
Of glory and of might
To fill the world with sight

Of what the good can do
When they are tried and true
To principles of right
That shine like morning light

Through all the world's dark places
Where evil shows its faces
But cannot win the day
When good shows its way.

From {{c|Silur}}'s opportunity
Seen in calamity
To {{c|Opiliona}}'s care
For life everywhere,

From {{c|Book}} {{c|Knights}} who defend
The knowledge we depend
Upon to light our way
Through each and every day,

To those who choose the dark
And leave their evil mark
On all the world around
Where they can be found,

The {{c|Silurian}} shows
How each one's choice grows
Into the world we see
For you and me.

Some choose to heal and mend
What others would rend
{{c|Apart}} with greed and hate
That seals our mortal fate.

{{c|Others}} choose to take
For their own selfish sake
What others need to live
And never learn to give.

The lesson clear as day
{{c|Shows}} us the way
To choose what we will be
For all eternity:

Those who heal and bless
Or those who make the mess
That others have to clean
In places yet unseen.

From {{c|Silur}}'s royal crown
To blood-suckers who drown
The world in pain and death,
Each choice draws its breath

From what we hold most dear:
Love that casts out fear
Or fear that kills all love
And blocks the light above.

The choice is ours to make
In every step we take
Along life's winding road
Where we must bear the load

Of what our choices bring
To every living thing
That shares this world with us
In ways both glorious

And terrible to see
For you and me
Who must decide each day
Which path we'll take away.

The {{c|Silurian}} age began
With one who had a plan
To rise from ruin's call
And build hope for all.

But also shows how some
Will always choose to come
Down on the side of death
With their every breath.

The choice is always ours
To use our mortal powers
For good or ill each day
Along our living way.

From opportunity's call
To rise above the fall
Of golden ages past
To build what will last,

The {{c|Silurian}} reminds
Us that each one finds
The world they choose to make
For everyone's sake.

Choose well, for what you choose
Will be what you will lose
Or gain for all the days
Of your immortal ways.

From {{c|Silur}}'s royal start
To ticks' bloodsucking art,
The lesson's clear to see:
We are what we choose to be.

---

The sons of {{c|Eurypter}} would
{{c|Usurp}} as no one could
The sons of {{c|Cephalus}}
And rule victorious.

{{c|Eurypter}} married fair
{{c|Pulmona}} everywhere
{{c|Beloved}}, and they'd disagree
On what their name would be.

Each had their own design
For their ancestral line:
"{{c|Eurypterids}}" he'd say,
"{{c|Arachnopulmonates}}" her way.

{{c|Eurypter}} and {{c|Pulmona}}
Bore children like none-a
Other: {{c|Eurypteron}}
And {{c|Styloner}}, begun

In rivalry so deep
That none could ever keep
{{c|Peace}} between the two
Who different paths knew.

{{c|Eurypteron}} and his brother
{{c|Styloner}}, like no other
{{c|Pair}} of siblings fought
For all that could be bought

With power and with might
{{c|Throughout}} the day and night.
When their mother died
They could not decide

Who would inherit all
The world at honor's call.
{{c|Eurypteron}} claimed skies
While {{c|Styloner}}'s eyes

Were set upon the land
Built by his own hand.
And so {{c|Eurypteron}} flew
Across domains he knew

Were his by right of birth
While {{c|Styloner}} walked earth
And claimed each step he took
{{c|According}} to the book

Of inheritance and law
That neither brother saw
The same way as the other
{{c|Despite}} they shared one mother.

The flight of {{c|Eurypteron}}
Across the sky begun
A dynasty of those
Who ruled where wind blows

{{c|High}} above the earth
From moment of their birth
To death's appointed day
They'd rule in their own way.

{{c|Eurypteron}} begat
Two sons: first he begat
{{c|Diploper}} the strong
And {{c|Eurypterus}}, long

In fertility beyond
What any could respond
To with equal measure—
Their numbers were his treasure.

{{c|Eurypterus}} was most
{{c|Fertile}} of the host
Of {{c|Silur}}'s noble sons.
In each generation begun

His house would grow
{{c|Ten}} thousand-fold, and so
His numbers multiplied
Beyond what could be tried

By any other line
In all of space and time.
{{c|Myriad}}-fold they grew
With offspring tried and true.

{{c|Diploper}} begat two:
{{c|Waeringos}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Carcinos}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Waeringos}} begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
{{c|Humiller}}, strong and brave,
And {{c|Adelops}}, who'd save

His line through numbers vast
That would forever last.
{{c|Adelops}} was small
But answered duty's call

With many children who
Were resilient and true,
Like bugs beneath the sea
In their tenacity.

{{c|Humiller}} married fair
{{c|Pterra}}, beyond compare
In beauty and in grace,
And in their dwelling place

{{c|Together}} they bore one
{{c|Son}} when day begun:
{{c|Slender}}, fast, and sly,
Who'd rule beneath the sky

And in the depths below.
They named him {{c|Slimon}}, though
His destiny was great
Beyond what they could state.

{{c|Slimon}} bore a son
Whose work, when it was done,
Would show the massive claws
That grew according to laws

Of nature from his mouth.
From north down to the south
His power would be known
When he had grown.

He named this son at first
{{c|Clawbert}}, but then burst
A strike of lightning bright
That filled the world with sight.

And {{c|Slimon}} took the sign
From powers divine
And changed his son's name
To {{c|Pterygo}}'s fame.

The sons of {{c|Pterygo}}
Were rulers high and low
Of all {{c|Eurypterids}}.
{{c|Fast}}, strong, their power bids

The world to bow before
Their might from shore to shore.
{{c|Regal}} in their way,
They ruled both night and day.

His youngest son was one
Called {{c|Scorpio}}, begun
As explorer of the new,
With vision clear and true.

{{c|Scorpio}} saw no land
Left for his command,
For all his brothers older
Had claimed, and none bolder

Could challenge their right
To rule with all their might
The territories vast
That they held firmly fast.

And so {{c|Scorpio}} looked
Up from his watery nook
Out of the sea to land
Built by no one's hand

But waiting to be claimed
By one who could be named
The first to make the leap
From waters dark and deep.

{{c|Scorpio}} ventured up
Like warrior with cup
Of courage in his heart
To play the pioneer's part.

His book gills became
{{c|Book}} lungs, and his name
Would live forevermore
From mountain peak to shore.

He claimed all lands of might
{{c|Euramerica}} in sight
For himself and his line
By right of the divine

Who favors those who dare
To venture everywhere
That none have gone before
To open up the door

Of possibility
For all humanity
And every living thing
That answers life's ring.

His sons are known today
As scorpions in their way,
Still carrying the torch
Of those who scorch

{{c|New}} paths through virgin land
Built by their own hand
From nothing into all
That answers courage's call.

{{c|Styloner}} married then
{{c|Rhena}}, and the pen
Of fate would write their names
In evolution's games.

{{c|Together}} they bore two:
{{c|Makoko}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Stylonurus}} strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Makoko}} begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
{{c|Mycter}} and {{c|Kokomo}},
Each destined high to go.

{{c|Mycter}} begat two more:
{{c|Flumon}} to explore
And {{c|Drepan}}, strong and true,
Who different pathways knew.

{{c|Flumon}} found no luck
In seas where he was stuck
With brothers and with cousins
Who by the dozens

Had claimed the seas for their
{{c|Own}} use, and would not share
With him a single place
To call his dwelling space.

So he searched rivers wide
With current as his guide
To find what he could claim
For his ancestral name.

{{c|Flumon}} begat two sons:
{{c|Hibbert}} when day begun
And {{c|Mycterops}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Hibbert}} was a great
{{c|River}} dweller whose fate
Was to be tough and large,
And he would take charge

Of all the river's course
With wisdom and with force.
{{c|Larger}}, tougher than
Any other man

Of his time, he survived
{{c|Tragedies}} and thrived
Through countless trials
Across thousands of miles.

His people were a race
{{c|Resilient}} in their place,
{{c|Powerful}} and old,
With stories yet untold

Of how they overcame
{{c|Whatever}} brought them shame
Or tried to break their will
Upon the river's sill.

{{c|Mycterops}} was strong
And versatile life long.
His two sons would continue
The work he would begin to

Do: living in the rivers
Where water always shivers
With life and searching for
{{c|Food}} from shore to shore

In most unlikely places
Where none could see their faces
But they would always find
What fed both heart and mind.

{{c|Megarachne}} and his brother
{{c|Minirachne}}, like no other
{{c|Pair}} ruled rivers wide
With power and with pride.

{{c|Sons}} of {{c|Mycterops}},
They were the tops
Of river royalty
In their dynasty.

But {{c|Minirachne}} was not
{{c|Satisfied}} with his lot
In rivers flowing free—
He wanted more to see.

{{c|Scorpio}} and {{c|Minirachne}}
Were always destined, see,
To fight for the same prize:
The land beneath the skies.

For both had more ambition
{{c|Than}} any opposition
Could contain or tame
In their quest for fame.

Both were men whose dreams
{{c|Surpassed}} all that seems
{{c|Possible}} to those
Who seek repose

In comfort and in ease
But never feel the breeze
Of challenge call their name
To play a greater game.

{{c|Minirachne}} climbed up high
Beneath the open sky
With {{c|Tetra}}, his fair wife,
To start a new life

In the world of land
Built by their own hand,
Where none had gone before
To open up the door.

His book lungs became
{{c|Book}} gills, and his name
Would be remembered long
In evolution's song.

He came to conquer all
The lands where {{c|Scorpio}}'s call
Had claimed the territory
For his own story.

And so the stage was set
For a conflict yet
{{c|Unseen}} in all the world
Where banners were unfurled

Between two mighty lines
With their different designs
On what the world should be
For all eternity.

From {{c|Eurypter}}'s marriage
To {{c|Pulmona}}'s carriage
Of their children into being
Came this foreseeing

Of conflict yet to come
When all would be done
And winners would be crowned
And losers would be found.

The sons of {{c|Eurypter}}
Would rise like {{c|Jupiter}}
Above all other lines
With their grand designs

To rule both sea and land
Built by their own hand
Through courage and through might
That shines like morning light.

From river to the sea,
From sea to land so free,
The eurypterids show
How ambitions grow

From small beginnings made
By those who are not afraid
To venture into spaces
Where none have shown their faces.

But also shows the cost
When some lines are lost
In conflict with their kin
That no one ever wins.

The rivalry between
{{c|Brothers}} who have seen
{{c|Different}} paths to take
For their own sake

And their children's future
{{c|Shows}} how nature's suture
{{c|Often}} cannot hold
When ambitions grow bold

Beyond what can be shared
By those who never cared
To find a peaceful way
To live from day to day.

From {{c|Scorpio}}'s bold climb
To {{c|Minirachne}}'s time
Of conquest and of war,
The lesson from of lore

Is clear for all to see:
{{c|Ambition}} must be free
But also must be wise
Beneath the starry skies.

The world is big enough
For all who are tough
{{c|Enough}} to make their way
Through each and every day

Of challenge and of strife
In this eternal life
Where all must find their place
In evolution's race.

But when ambition turns
To conflict, and it burns
The bridges that connect
Those who should protect

Each other as they grow
Through all they'll ever know
Of joy and pain and love
Beneath the stars above,

Then all become the losers
In the games that choosers
Play when they forget
That none can ever get

All they want alone
Without the seeds they've sown
Of cooperation true
With me and you.

The eurypterids' rise
{{c|Shows}} us to be wise
In how we use our power
In each and every hour

Of our living days
Along our mortal ways
Where choice determines all
Who answer life's great call.

From {{c|Eurypter}}'s flight
To {{c|Scorpio}}'s sight
Of lands beyond the sea
Where he could be

The first to make his mark
Upon a world so dark
With possibility
For all humanity,

The lesson clear as day
{{c|Shows}} us the way
To be both brave and wise
Beneath the starry skies

Where all our dreams can grow
If we but choose to sow
The seeds of peace and love
{{c|Blessed}} from above

In every choice we make
For everyone's sake
Who shares this world with us
In ways both glorious

And challenging to see
For you and me
Who must decide each day
Which path we'll take away.

The sons of {{c|Eurypter}}
Like shining {{c|Jupiter}}
Rose high above the rest
And passed each mortal test

Through courage, wisdom, might,
And inner sight
That saw what could be done
Beneath the shining sun

If only they would dare
To venture everywhere
That none had gone before
To open up the door

Of possibility
For all eternity
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you today.

{{c|Vater}} was the son so great
In the tenth generation's fate
Of {{c|Pteraspis}}, and he'd be
{{c|Ancestor}} of humanity

And myriad species more
From mountain peak to shore.
His innovation would
Change all for the good.

{{c|Vater}} built a channel
{{c|Grand}} beyond all span-el
{{c|Uniting}} liver bright
And pancreas in sight

Into his belly's space.
To this day we trace
This channel's honored name:
"{{c|Ampulla}} of {{c|Vater}}'s" fame.

Such an exalted father,
{{c|Father}} of more than other
{{c|Men}} could ever dream,
The {{c|Elohim}}'s esteem

Called him {{c|Abraham}}
{{c|According}} to their plan
For one whose progeny
Would fill eternity.

{{c|Vater}} bore two sons:
{{c|Arandus}} when begun
The day, and {{c|Hestracon}}
Whose work would carry on

The family's great name
Through evolutionary flame
That burns in every heart
That plays innovation's part.

{{c|Hestracon}} found his belly
{{c|Inadequate}}, not ready
For the work he knew
That he would have to do.

From mouth to anus all
The same, and he'd call
This simple with disdain—
Only his father's main

{{c|Ampulla}} in the middle
To solve digestion's riddle.
But this was not enough
For one so strong and tough

As {{c|Hestracon}}, who'd see
What greater good could be
If he would dare to build
What none before had willed.

{{c|Hestracon}} built with care
A chamber prepared
Before his father's gift
To give digestion lift.

He called it his stomach,
And this would come to stick
As the great divider
Between the provider

Of food from mouth above
And what intestines' love
Would process down below
To make the body grow.

Before the stomach laid
The esophagus, well-made
To carry food along
Its pathway, swift and strong.

After the stomach laid
The intestine, well-played
In its appointed role
To nourish the whole.

{{c|Hestracon}} begat two:
{{c|Astrops}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Eteros}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Eteros}} begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
{{c|Cyatha}}, cup-shield bright,
And {{c|Tsubasa}}'s sight

{{c|Wing}}-shielded, prepared
For all that he had dared
To face in his lifetime
Through reason and through rhyme.

{{c|Tsubasa}} begat two:
{{c|Thelos}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Cephalus}} the wise
With penetrating eyes.

{{c|Thelos}} broke his armor
Into scales—no former
{{c|Rigidity}} would bind
His innovative mind.

Into innumerable scales
His armor never fails
To give him flexibility
And great ability

To live within the reefs
Where none could find reliefs
From rigid armor's weight
That sealed their swimming fate.

Where none others could bend
{{c|Well}} enough to transcend
The coral's tight embrace,
{{c|Thelos}} found his place.

Neither sons of {{c|Arthropus}}
Nor sons of {{c|Molluscus}},
Nor sons of {{c|Chordatus}}
Could match his status

In the reef's tight spaces
Where his grace replaces
{{c|Rigidity}} with flow
That helps him grow

Into every niche
Where others couldn't reach
The food that he could take
For his own sake.

{{c|Cephalus}} bore wings bright
On each side in sight
Of his helmet's form,
Through calm and raging storm.

His head flew as he swam
{{c|According}} to his plan
For stability and grace
In every watery place.

His lateral line would keep
Him ahead, and never sleep
In vigilance for all
That might befall

His swimming through the sea.
{{c|Aware}} of all that he
Could sense around his form,
He weathered every storm.

{{c|Cephalus}} begat two:
{{c|Galeas}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Osteos}}, who'd see
What innovation's key

Could open in the world
Where possibilities unfurled
For those who dared to think
Beyond tradition's link.

{{c|Osteos}} was in plight—
His bones weren't right
For efficiency, he knew.
He had to make them new.

His bones were expensive,
{{c|Comprehensively}}
{{c|Wasting}} countless moles
Of calcium that rolls

Through phosphorus and more
{{c|Elements}} by the score
That could be better used
If they were not abused

In static, lifeless bone
That stood there all alone
Without a greater plan
For helping mortal man.

So he decided he
Would build more cleverly
His skeleton anew
With wisdom tried and true.

{{c|Osteos}} built with care
{{c|Blood}} channels everywhere
Inside his bones, making
{{c|Living}}, breathing, taking

{{c|Stores}} of minerals
That worked like generals
In abundance building up
From nature's flowing cup,

And in scarcity
He'd borrow, you see,
From what he'd stored before
Like treasure in his store.

And so he grew more strong
And prosperous life long
{{c|Than}} all his relatives
Who took what nature gives

But never learned to save
For what the future gave
Of challenges and need
When they would have to feed

From stores they'd built in plenty
When resources weren't scanty
But flowed like rivers wide
With bounty as their guide.

{{c|Osteos}} bore two sons:
{{c|Pituri}} when begun
The day, and {{c|Ostracos}}
Whose children, glorious,

Would multiply and spread
Until the world was fed
With countless forms of life
Through harmony, not strife.

{{c|Ostracos}} bore a host
Of sons from coast to coast:
A million who would spread
{{c|Wherever}} they were led

By life's eternal call
To multiply for all
Who'd come in times ahead
When they would have to fed

The world with their own forms
Through calm and raging storms
Of evolution's way
From night into the day.

{{c|Pituri}} grew a snout
{{c|Long}} beyond all doubt
The longest ever seen
In evolution's scene.

{{c|Pituri}} begat then
{{c|Beakon}} beyond all ken
In wisdom and in might
To see with clearer sight.

{{c|Pituri}}'s mouth was made
Of lips, but never strayed
Into the realm of jaws—
He followed simpler laws.

Could only close the space
But never could erase
His prey with biting might—
No jaw was in his sight.

But {{c|Beakon}} saw potential
In what was essential
About his father's snout
And figured it out.

And so {{c|Beakon}} moved
His gill arches and proved
That innovation's art
Could play a vital part.

Into his mouth he brought
The arches, and he fought
For food in a new way
That worked both night and day.

{{c|Beakon}}'s son named {{c|Gnathus}}
Saw potential, glorious,
And he with wife {{c|Pelaca}}
{{c|Hunted}} like none other.

They hunted trilobites
And brought them to their lights
Of innovation's flame
That burned in their name.

They didn't just catch prey
In the ancient way
But crushed them with their might
And brought them to the sight

Of their armored jaws
That followed nature's laws
But used them in new ways
{{c|Throughout}} their living days.

They sliced through every meal
With jaws of steel-hard feel
That brought life-giving food
In their hunting mood.

And so {{c|Jaws}} were born
On that fateful morn
When {{c|Gnathus}} and {{c|Pelaca}}
Showed what none could match-a:

The power to break through
What none before could do—
To crush and to consume
What others could assume

Was safe in armor's shell
From those who'd never tell
The secret of the jaw
That follows newer law.

The world would never be
The same for you and me
From that day forth when jaws
Became the newer laws

Of predatory might
That brought to sight
A revolution new
In what life could do.

From {{c|Vater}}'s ampulla
To {{c|Gnathus}}' formula
For crushing with his jaws
{{c|According}} to new laws,

The vertebrates show how
{{c|Innovation}}'s vow
To never be content
With what is merely sent

By fate, but always strive
To be more alive
And capable and strong
{{c|Throughout}} their whole life long

{{c|Journey}} through the sea
Of possibility
Where those who dare to grow
Will always come to know

{{c|New}} heights of what can be
For all eternity
When innovation's fire
{{c|Burns}} with true desire

To make the world more bright
With new forms that take flight
Beyond what was before
To open up the door

Of possibility
For all humanity
And every living thing
That answers life's ring.

From {{c|Hestracon}}'s stomach
To {{c|Osteos}}' pragmatic
{{c|Bones}} with channels through,
From scales that {{c|Thelos}} knew

Would give him flexibility
To {{c|Cephalus}}' ability
To fly through water's space
With stabilizing grace,

The vertebrates remind
Us that the searching mind
That breaks from what is known
Can reap what it has sown

In innovations new
That see old dreams through
To heights beyond all thought
That wisdom ever brought.

From simple mouth that closed
To jaw that none opposed
In crushing power's might,
The story shows the sight

Of how small changes grow
Into the flow
Of evolution's stream
Where nothing's what they seem

But everything can change
Beyond familiar range
If we but have the will
To climb each higher hill

Of possibility
Through all eternity
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you today.

The jaws that {{c|Gnathus}} made
Will never ever fade
From vertebrate design—
{{c|Protection}} so fine

Against the world's hard ways
{{c|Throughout}} our living days
When we must fight to eat
And make our lives complete.

From {{c|Vater}}'s family tree
To jaws that set us free
From limitations old
Of stories yet untold,

The vertebrates have shown
How far we've grown
From simple, humble start
To mastery of art

That lets us rule the sea
And land and be
The masters of our fate
Through innovations great

That never cease to grow
In all we'll ever know
Of what can be achieved
When dreams are believed

And turned to reality
Through wise ability
To see what others miss
And find in this

The power to transcend
All limits and extend
The boundaries of life
Through harmony, not strife.

The world that {{c|Gnathus}} bit
With jaws of steel and grit
{{c|Lives}} on in every tooth
That tells the truth

Of how innovation's way
Can change both night and day
Into something new
For me and you

Who dare to break the mold
Of stories never told
And write upon the page
Of evolution's age

{{c|New}} chapters yet unread
Where we are led
By wisdom's guiding light
To make the future bright

With possibilities
That nobody sees
But those who dare to dream
Of more than what they seem

And turn those dreams to life
Through joy and through strife
That marks the growing soul
Who plays the vital role

In evolution's plan
For every woman, man,
And every living thing
That answers hope's ring.

From {{c|Vater}}'s great design
To {{c|Gnathus}}' jaw so fine,
The story's clear to see:
{{c|Innovation}} sets us free.

---

The sons of {{c|Plantus}} were
{{c|Reinvigorated}}, blur
Of ancient dreams renewed
When their hope was imbued

With power from the great
{{c|Sorceress}} whose fate
Would change the world entire:
{{c|Polycomb}}'s desire.

For eleven generations long
Her lineage sang the song
Of alternating climb
Through evolutionary time

To {{c|Polysporos}}' height.
She lived beyond the sight
Of independence free
In her mother's decree

That kept her in the womb
Like prisoner in tomb
With brothers, sisters all
Who answered duty's call

But yearned to live instead
Like mothers, never dead
To independence strong
{{c|Throughout}} their whole life long

{{c|Journey}} through the world
Where freedom's flag unfurled
Could guide them to their fate
Beyond the small estate

Of childhood's narrow bounds
Where only duty sounds
Its call to those who'd be
More than they can see.

{{c|Daughter}} of rulers great:
{{c|Clytemnestra}}'s fate
And {{c|Agamemnon}}'s line
Made her form divine.

Yet forced to live her life
Through reproductive strife
Only to bear children
When her heart was ridden

With desire to be more
{{c|Than}} what came before:
For she was sporophyte
While they held the right

Of gametophyte's power
{{c|Throughout}} each passing hour
To rule the world entire
With their heart's desire.

{{c|Polycomb}} read each day
In her mother's array
Of books to understand
Why fate's heavy hand

Had given her such meager
{{c|Existence}}—not eager
But wondering why
Beneath the starry sky

Her life was so confined
To bearing, her mind
{{c|Never}} free to explore
What she was living for.

{{c|Polycomb}} read the tales
Of mothers through the vales
Of time, each saga telling
Of those who were rebelling

Against their narrow fate
To be truly great
In ways beyond the power
Of any single hour.

She read of {{c|Mardoll}}'s scroll
And {{c|Shiva}}'s mighty role,
And saw that the order
Was not like a border

{{c|Eternal}}, as her mother
Said—but rather
{{c|Far}} from fixed in stone
For those who'd grown

Beyond what they were told
In stories new and old
Of what they had to be
For all eternity.

She saw a scroll that bore
The name "PRC2"—and more
{{c|Intrigue}} than she had known
{{c|Filled}} her to the bone.

{{c|Polycomb}} {{c|Repressive}}
{{c|Complex}}—its aggressive
{{c|Scripture}} was the chain
That bound her in her pain.

She saw the words that kept
Her power while she wept
For freedom never known—
The scripture of her own

{{c|Repression}}, written clear
In words that brought her fear
But also brought her hope
To learn how she could cope.

And so {{c|Polycomb}} burned
The scriptures, and she learned
That PRC2's power
Would rule her not one hour

More. She took her mother's
{{c|Lands}} and all the others'
{{c|Cities}} for her own
{{c|Now}} that she had grown

Beyond what they decreed
She ever could succeed
In being or becoming
When freedom's light was coming.

And so she broke the wall
That bounded one and all
Who'd lived before her time
In slavery's grim rhyme.

She grew spores with might
And calyptra bright
And stoma like her sisters
Who'd been the resisters

Of change throughout the years.
And rhizoids through tears
Of joy she built as well
To break tradition's spell.

And so through rhizoids strong
{{c|Water}} moved along
From earth up to her form,
Through calm and raging storm.

And through her stoma bright
{{c|Water}} took its flight
Into the heavens high
Beneath the starry sky.

This was how her life
{{c|Transcended}} all the strife
Of what she'd been before
To open up the door

Of possibility
For all humanity
And every living thing
That answers freedom's ring.

She prayed to {{c|Tryptophanes}},
{{c|Lord}} of life's refrains,
{{c|Lord}} of the sun so bright
Who fills the world with light.

She prayed to grow to heights
Beyond what mortal sights
Had ever seen before
From mountain peak to shore.

And so {{c|Lord}} {{c|Tryptophanes}}
{{c|Blessed}} her with refrains
Of {{c|Auxin}}, and she grew
Toward the light so true.

When sun struck {{c|Auxin}}'s power
It would decay each hour,
But in the shade it grew
In numbers tried and true.

And so her stems would turn
And reach and ever yearn
Toward the light above
{{c|Guided}} by His love.

{{c|Polycomb}} bore a daughter
Who'd teach what she had taught her:
{{c|Knoxy}} was her name,
Who'd win eternal fame.

{{c|Knoxy}} married {{c|Xylon}}
And together, strong upon
Their foundation's might,
They took after the sight

Of {{c|Polycomb}}'s great way
That lit their every day
With possibility
For all eternity.

{{c|Knoxy}} searched through books
In all the ancient nooks
And found a scroll that bore
The name she'd been seeking for:

"KNOX2" it was called,
And by it she was enthralled
To learn the secret power
That ruled her every hour.

KNOTTED-like TALE gene
Was what had always been
The force that kept her bound
From freedom that she'd found

Her mother had achieved
When she had believed
That change was possible
For those who're capable.

And so {{c|Knoxy}} and {{c|Xylon}}
Built a kingdom strong upon
The heavens reaching high
Beneath the starry sky

Like {{c|Polycomb}} before
Had opened up the door
Of what could be achieved
When freedom was believed.

But their kingdom's roads
Were clogged with heavy loads—
{{c|Water}} struggled to reach
The heights their hearts would teach

Them they should aspire
To with their desire
For growth beyond all measure
Like some sacred treasure.

And so {{c|Xylon}} gave
To one clan what would save
The kingdom from its plight:
He named them for their sight

"{{c|Xylem}}" and their job
Was to help the mob
Of subjects in the city
Feel the water's pity

No more—but let it flow
From roots that lay below
To leaves that reached on high
Beneath the starry sky.

{{c|Tracheids}} they became,
{{c|Carriers}} of fame
Who bore the water pure
From foundation sure

To heights beyond all thought
That wisdom ever brought
To those who dared to dream
Of more than what they seem.

{{c|Xylon}} and {{c|Knoxy}} bore
A son to explore
The world with eyes that saw
What could fulfill the law

Of justice for all those
Who served without repose
But never got their share
Of what was growing there.

{{c|Pholon}} was his name,
And he would win the fame
Of solving the great problem
That threatened to hobble them.

{{c|Pholon}} saw his roots
Were starving, and the fruits
Of their laborious ways
{{c|Never}} brought the praise

Or nourishment they'd earned
Through all that they had learned
Of how to serve the whole
By playing their small role.

His {{c|Mycorrhizae}}
{{c|Unionized}} one day
And demanded ten times more
{{c|Sucrose}} than before

For all their faithful labor
That helped him and his neighbor
{{c|Survive}} and grow and thrive
{{c|Throughout}} their days alive.

So {{c|Pholon}} built new ways
Like {{c|Xylem}}, and the praise
He earned was well-deserved
For those he truly served.

But these channels carried
{{c|Food}} to those who'd married
Their labor to his cause—
Not water, but because

Of need for nourishment
That fairly should be sent
To all who did their part
With faithful, loyal heart.

He called these channels bright
"{{c|Phloem}}," and their sight
Was beautiful to see
For all eternity.

In leaves the sugar flowed
Into the phloem's abode
With pressure and with might
Both day and through the night.

The concentration's pull
{{c|Sucked}} water beautiful
From xylem to the sweet
{{c|Sugar}}'s retreat.

And pressure pumped away
From source throughout the day
To where it needed be
For all to see.

In roots the sugar flowed
Out of phloem's abode,
And with it water went
{{c|Back}} to xylem, sent

To start the cycle new
That served the whole way through
The kingdom, high and low,
And helped it grow.

And by this system fair
The roots received their share,
And faithful sons of bright
{{c|Glomeros}}' sight

Received what they were owed
For traveling the road
Of service to the whole
By playing their small role.

And so the wood wide web
Of {{c|Pholon}}'s love would ebb
And flow throughout the land
Built by his own hand.

Through faithful {{c|Mycorrhizae}}
He provided for his eye
To see his sons well-fed
With living bread.

{{c|Pholon}} became known
As {{c|Cookson}}, and he'd grown
Into a provider
And faithful guider

Who brought prosperity
To all who'd ever be
Within his kingdom's bounds
Where justice's sound

Could guide them day by day
Along their living way
Where all received their share
Of what was growing there.

His sons lived underground
And they had found
The wood-wide web could feed
Their every need

Without the work of making
Their own bread-breaking
Through photosynthesis—
They found their bliss

In lazy prosperity
{{c|Throughout}} their spree
Of plenty without toil
From the rich soil.

And this is how the roles
Of ancient souls
{{c|Swapped}} their positions
In life's transmissions:

{{c|Sporophyte}} and gametophyte
{{c|Switched}} in the sight
Of those who understand
How life's command

Can change when times require
{{c|New}} forms to aspire
To heights beyond the old
In stories yet untold.

{{c|Cookson}} bore a grandson
Whose work, when it was done,
Would change the world entire:
{{c|Tracheus}}' desire.

By {{c|Tracheus}}' mighty hand
The tracheophytes' band
Was born to rule the earth
Through evolutionary birth.

{{c|Tracheus}} built leaves bright,
{{c|Microphylls}} in sight
With veins that carried life
Through harmony, not strife.

{{c|Solar}} panels they became
In his energy game
Of green power from the sun
That could not be outdone.

He built his city great
Beyond what any fate
Had ever seen before
From mountain peak to shore.

{{c|Greater}} even than
Great {{c|Pholon}}'s mighty plan
His city rose on high
Beneath the starry sky.

He designated clans
{{c|According}} to his plans
For those who'd serve the whole
By playing their small role.

{{c|Collenchyma}} he named
One clan, and they were famed
For flexible support
Of every kind and sort

To keep his city strong
{{c|Throughout}} its whole life long
{{c|Journey}} through the days
Of evolutionary ways.

And {{c|Sclerenchyma}}'s clan
He built with different plan:
{{c|Hard}} and full of lignin,
Their work would begin

The age of wood so strong
That would last life long
And give the world its trees
That dance upon the breeze.

{{c|Soon}} the sons of {{c|Tracheus}}
Would rule, victorious,
The lands from sea to sea
For all eternity.

The {{c|Devonian}} was
{{c|Beginning}}, and because
Of what these pioneers
Had built through joy and tears,

The world would never be
The same for you and me
Who walk upon the land
Built by their own hand.

From {{c|Polycomb}}'s rebellion
Against her life's subjection
To {{c|Tracheus}}' city bright
That reached toward the light,

The plants have shown the way
That leads from night to day
Of freedom and of growth
Supported by the oath

To serve the greater good
While taking what they could
To feed their own deep need
For growth like planted seed.

From burning scriptures old
That kept them in the hold
Of others' narrow dreams
To building the streams

Of water, food, and light
That make the future bright
With possibility
For all eternity,

The plants remind us all
Who hear their gentle call
That growth requires the will
To climb each higher hill

Of what we can become
When we are no longer numb
To all that we could be
If we would just be free

From limitations old
In stories never told
Of what we're meant to do
For me and you today.

The wood wide web they built
Without any guilt
{{c|Shows}} how cooperation
Across every nation

Of life can help us grow
Beyond what we can know
{{c|Alone}}, but when we share
Our burdens and our care,

The whole becomes much more
{{c|Than}} what came before
When each one tried alone
To build their place and home.

From {{c|Polycomb}}'s first read
Of scriptures that had led
Her people into chains
To {{c|Tracheus}}' domains

That reached toward the sun
With work that's never done
Of growing toward the light
With all their mortal might,

The plants show us the way
To live from day to day
In harmony with all
Who answer life's sweet call

To grow beyond the small
And heed the greater call
Of what we can achieve
When we truly believe

In possibility
Through all eternity
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you today.

The {{c|Devonian}} dawn
When old ways were withdrawn
And new forms took their place
In evolution's race

Was built by those who dared
To break what others shared
As truth that could not bend
But had to find its end

In those with clearer sight
Who walked toward the light
Of what could be achieved
When freedom was believed.

From {{c|Polycomb}} to {{c|Tracheus}},
The plants victorious
Show how rebellion's fire
Can lift us ever higher

To heights we never dreamed
When we were what seemed
{{c|Too}} small to make a change
Beyond familiar range.

But when we dare to read
The scriptures that would feed
Our minds with truth set free
From false authority,

And when we dare to burn
What makes our spirits yearn
For freedom never known
In chains we've outgrown,

Then we can build anew
What's beautiful and true
And reach toward the sun
Until our work is done

Of making this world bright
With love's eternal light
That shines for all to see
Through all eternity.

The plants that {{c|Tracheus}} made
Will never ever fade
From this world's living face
But hold their rightful place

As teachers of the way
To live from day to day
In growth toward the light
That makes the future bright

With hope for all who dare
To breathe the freedom's air
And grow beyond what's known
Into what they've outgrown.

The {{c|Devonian}} age began
With more than mortal plan
To free the world from chains
And heal its ancient pains

Through growth and light and love
{{c|Blessed}} from above
With power to transcend
All limits without end.

From burning scriptures old
To stories yet untold
Of what we can become
When we are no longer numb

To all our hearts can hold
Of courage, strong and bold,
The plants show us the way
To freedom's bright new day.

{{c|Devon}}'s city was the greatest sight
Among all cities burning bright
In that era, and so
The name would always show:

The new era was called
{{c|Devonian}}, enthralled
By {{c|Devon}}'s mighty rule
Like some divine school.

As {{c|Devon}} sat upon
The ground when day begun,
He sucked water so pure
Into his gill, secure

Between his jaws and skull,
{{c|Notched}} and beautiful
In its design so fine
Like architecture divine.

Through his spiracle bright
His mouth filled with sight
Of water, and the gold
Of oxygen, so old

Yet rich beyond all measure
Like some sacred treasure
Built through millennia long
By {{c|Saya}}'s daughters' song.

Through his gills the flow
Of hematic maidens go,
{{c|Carrying}} oxygen sweet
To make his life complete.

To all his subjects they
Would carry, night and day,
The breath of life so pure
That would always endure.

And to the brain they went
Through spiracle, well-sent
To bring much more to eyes
Beneath the starry skies

And brain that ruled his form
Through calm and raging storm
With wisdom and with might
Both day and through the night.

In opposition's way
And countercurrent's play,
The blood took oxygen
Like wise and faithful men

Who know the secret art
Of playing their true part
In life's eternal dance
Of every circumstance.

When {{c|Devon}} moved his frame
Through waters without shame,
He opened his mouth wide
And let the water glide

{{c|Freely}} over and through
His gills, so tried and true,
With current's gentle flow
That helped his body grow.

When he found food to eat
To make his life complete,
He cleaved it with his jaw
{{c|According}} to the law

Of predatory might
That filled the world with sight
Of what the strong can do
When they are tried and true.

And behind his teeth bright
That gleamed like morning light,
His jaws would follow through
And chew what he could chew.

Down in his stomach deep
Where acids always keep
Their vigil through the night,
{{c|Food}} was purified bright.

{{c|Pancreas}} and gallbladder
{{c|Joined}} like faithful gladder
{{c|Partners}} in the art
Of playing their true part.

And intestine spiraling
Beyond all parallel-ing
In numbers without end
Would help his form transcend

Its limits, and nutrition
Would enter, transmission
Into his veins so bright
That carried day and night

His portal vein would bring
{{c|Life}}'s most essential thing:
{{c|Fats}} and sugars sweet,
{{c|Proteins}} complete,

{{c|Phosphorus}} and metals
That settled like petals
Of life within his form,
Through calm and raging storm.

And vitamins so pure
That would always endure
{{c|Throughout}} his living days
In their life-giving ways.

And his liver would clean
His blood, and always keen
To purify and bless
What others would caress

With poison or with harm
That might his spirit harm,
His liver worked each day
To keep death's touch away.

The kidneys emptied in
All waste, and without sin
They filtered what was pure
From what could not endure.

And out the cloaca
Went waste, and none could mock-a
The wisdom of design
That was so fine.

When {{c|Devon}} married fair
His wife beyond compare,
He released his sperm bright
Into her loving sight.

Out the cloaca's door
To her eggs, and what's more,
From his million children
Two would be the risen:

{{c|Llŷr}} and {{c|Stennisio}},
Both glorious
In their appointed ways
{{c|Throughout}} their living days.

The sons of {{c|Stennisio}}
Lived in ratio
Across the seafloor wide
With ocean as their guide.

{{c|Eating}} clams each day
In their ancient way,
They lived lives of the deep
Where ocean secrets keep.

{{c|Llŷr}} begat {{c|Bran}} so strong
Who lived his whole life long
In wisdom and in might
Both day and through the night.

{{c|Bran}} begat {{c|Caradoc}},
{{c|Solid}} as a rock
In all his noble ways
{{c|Throughout}} his living days.

{{c|Caradoc}} begat three:
{{c|Cynan}} of the sea,
{{c|Acantho}}, strong and true,
And {{c|Sudopedal}} too.

The daughters of {{c|Acantho}}
Were beautiful, and so
They filled the world with grace
In every watery place.

{{c|Cynan}} begat {{c|Cadwr}},
Who'd be the withdrawer
Of none from their true course
But guide with gentle force.

{{c|Cadwr}} begat {{c|Eudaf}},
Who never would laugh
At those who tried their best
To pass each mortal test.

{{c|Eudaf}} begat {{c|Morfawr}},
Whose name means "great war"
But he was man of peace
Where all strife would cease.

{{c|Morfawr}} begat two sons:
{{c|Tudwal}} when day begun
And {{c|Rhineheart}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Rhineheart}} lived upon
The {{c|Rhine}} when day begun,
{{c|Flattened}} and hidden well
Like some secret spell.

{{c|Invisible}} was he
To those who couldn't see
The wisdom of his way
{{c|Throughout}} each passing day.

Like ray before rays came
To win their lasting fame,
He lived his hidden life
Without much joy or strife.

{{c|Tudwal}} begat two more:
{{c|Cynfawr}} to explore
And {{c|Antiarchon}} wild
Who was rebellion's child.

{{c|Antiarchon}} rebelled
Against all that was held
As truth by ancestors
And other predecessors.

He stood against {{c|Archons}}—
An {{c|Anarchist}} who spawns
{{c|Revolution}} in his heart
To play rebellion's part.

He lived beneath the soil
And waited there to spoil
The plans of those above
Who knew not how to love.

For prey he'd always wait
To seal their mortal fate
With ambush from below
Where none would ever go

To look for him or find
His revolutionary mind
That plotted every day
To make his enemies pay.

The sons of {{c|Antiarchon}}
Would form great bands upon
The earth, guerrillas all
Who'd answer freedom's call.

They'd haunt the sons of bright
{{c|Animus}} day and night
Until the world was free
From their authority.

But {{c|Cynfawr}} chose instead
A path where he was led
By dreams of finding home
{{c|Wherever}} he would roam.

{{c|Custennin}} was his son
Who when his search begun
Would travel far and wide
With hope as his guide.

He searched through every land
Until he'd understand
Where he was meant to be
For all eternity.

And finally he found
Upon the fertile ground
Of {{c|China}}, far away,
His home where he could stay.

{{c|Custennin}} begat two:
{{c|Uther}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Petallon}} so bright
Who filled the world with sight.

{{c|Uther}} begat then
Two children beyond ken:
{{c|Arthur}} and {{c|Maxil}} strong
Who lived their whole life long.

{{c|Arthur}} bore in time
A son and daughter fine:
{{c|Arthur the Younger}}, who'd
Do more than others could,

And {{c|Ptycho}}, maiden fair
Beyond all compare
In beauty and in grace
{{c|Throughout}} her dwelling place.

The daughters of fair {{c|Ptycho}}
Were numerous, and so
Among them was one great:
{{c|Mary}}, whose fate

Would be to bear a son
When her work was done
That none had done before
From mountain peak to shore.

{{c|Mary}}, {{c|Mother}} of
{{c|Icthys}}, blessed with love
From heaven high above,
Bore placenta's shove

{{c|Millions}} of years before
Any others wore
This gift of nurturing
That motherhood would bring.

The sons of {{c|Arthur}} then
({{c|The Younger}}) beyond ken
Became known far and wide
As those who'd be the guide

Of {{c|Arthrodires}}' line
With characteristics fine
{{c|Throughout}} the world so vast
From first unto the last.

{{c|Arthur the Younger}} bore
Three sons to explore
The world with different eyes:
{{c|Mordred}}, who'd comprise

{{c|Rebellion}} in his heart,
And {{c|Wuttago}}'s part,
And {{c|Actino}} the bright
Who filled the world with sight.

{{c|Mordred}} turned against
His father, and he fenced
With honor's sacred code
Upon dishonor's road.

He bore two sons in time:
{{c|Philip}}, so prime
In all his evil ways,
And {{c|Melehan}}'s days

Of darkness and of shame
That blackened his name
{{c|Throughout}} the world entire
With corruption's fire.

{{c|Melehan}} begat two:
{{c|Brachy}}, tried and true
In evil's darkest art,
And {{c|Phlyctae}}'s part.

The sons of {{c|Brachy}} ruled
The world, and they schooled
All others in their might,
{{c|Overthrowing}} the sight

Of {{c|Silur}}'s ancient line
That once was so divine
But now would have to yield
To {{c|Brachy}}'s battlefield.

{{c|Brachy}} begat three:
{{c|Eubar}} of the sea,
{{c|Buchan}}, strong and wild,
And {{c|Homosteus}}' child.

{{c|Eubar}} begat two:
{{c|Pachos}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Coccos}}, who would be
{{c|Living}} by the sea.

{{c|Pachos}} begat then
Two children beyond ken:
{{c|Dunkella}}, who would grow
{{c|Greater}} than we know

Any had before
From mountain peak to shore,
And {{c|Aspino}} the bright
Who filled the world with sight.

{{c|Dunkella}} grew to be
{{c|Greatest}} yet to see
Among all {{c|Metazo}}:
{{c|Six}} meters high to show

Her power and her might—
Three {{c|Jaekelopterii}} bright
In length, and though not long
As {{c|Cameroceras}} strong,

She had a thousand times
His men in war's rhymes
And ruled with iron hand
{{c|Throughout}} the entire land.

The sons and daughters all
Of {{c|Pachos}} heard the call
To greatness, and they grew
{{c|Strong}} and powerful too.

They ruled the world entire
In that age of fire
When power was the law
That all the world saw.

But {{c|Maxil}}, {{c|Arthur}}'s brother,
Bore a child like no other:
{{c|Qilinyu}} was his name,
Who'd win eternal fame.

{{c|Qilinyu}} begat
{{c|Entelognathus}}, begat
With jaw that was complete
From head down to feet.

{{c|Entelognathus}} bore
{{c|Janusicthus}} to explore
The world with newer art
That set his line apart.

{{c|Janusicthus}} brought
His teeth as none had thought
From gills unto his jaw
{{c|According}} to new law.

And so his jaw crushed down
With teeth of great renown—
Not bone, but teeth so bright
That gleamed like morning light.

He brought his skull inside
His head, and there to bide
The nerves would always dwell
That served his body well.

{{c|Sensing}} all around
His form, without a sound
He knew what others felt
When danger near them dwelt.

He became the sire
Of all who'd aspire
To be both fish and beast
From greatest unto least.

From {{c|Devon}}'s city great
To {{c|Janusicthus}}' fate
That led to fish and more,
The tale from shore to shore

{{c|Shows}} how innovation's art
Can play the vital part
In making life evolve
And every problem solve

That stands upon the way
Of progress every day
From simple unto complex
In life's eternal specs.

From gill to lung to jaw
That follows newer law,
Each change that life would make
Was for survival's sake.

But also shows how some
Will choose what they become
Through violence and through greed
That plants destruction's seed.

While others choose the way
Of peace from day to day
And building something new
That's beautiful and true.

From {{c|Antiarchon}}'s revolt
Against the lightning bolt
Of tyranny and power
In that ancient hour,

To {{c|Mary}}'s gift of love
{{c|Blessed}} from above
That nurtured life within
Her womb, free from sin,

The lineages show how
We must choose here and now
What kind of world we'll make
For all our children's sake.

The {{c|Devonian}} age
Wrote upon history's page
The story of the choice
Between two different voice:

The voice of those who'd build
And those who'd never yield
To others' right to live
But only take, not give.

From {{c|Devon}}'s peaceful ways
{{c|Throughout}} his living days
To {{c|Brachy}}'s iron rule
That made the world his tool,

The lesson's clear to see:
We choose what we will be
And what our children learn
As time's great pages turn.

The fish that {{c|Janusicthus}} made
Will never ever fade
From this world's waters bright
But swim throughout the night

And day with teeth and jaw
That follow nature's law
But also serve the good
As all creation should.

From {{c|Devon}}'s spiracle
To {{c|Dunkella}}'s miracle
Of size and power great,
The vertebrates' fate

{{c|Shows}} how life finds its way
From night into the day
Of possibility
For all eternity.

The {{c|Devonian}} dawn
When old forms were withdrawn
And newer forms took place
In evolution's race

Was built by those who dared
To dream and who cared
For more than what they were
And what they could confer

Upon the world around
Where they could be found
{{c|Living}} day by day
In their chosen way.

From {{c|Devon}}'s city bright
To fish with tooth and sight,
The age shows what can grow
When we let courage flow

Through every choice we make
For all our children's sake
Who'll inherit what we build
In the fields we've tilled

With love or hate or fear
{{c|Throughout}} each passing year
Of our brief time on earth
Where we show our worth

By what we choose to do
For me and you
And every living thing
That answers life's ring.

The {{c|Devonian}} age began
With more than mortal plan
To make the world more bright
With love's eternal light

That shines in every heart
That plays the loving part
In life's eternal song
That makes the weak grow strong.

From {{c|Devon}}'s peaceful reign
To {{c|Brachy}}'s war-torn stain
Upon the world's bright face,
The lesson and the grace

Of choice is clear to see:
We are what we choose to be
And what we choose to leave
For those who still believe

In possibility
Through all eternity
Where love will find a way
To light each darkening day

With hope that never dies
Beneath the starry skies
Where all our dreams can grow
If we will let them flow

From hearts that dare to care
For life everywhere
That grows beneath the sun
Until all time is done.

# Chapter 55: The {{c|Forest}} {{c|Cathedral}}

As {{c|Devon}}'s sons grew strong and true in might,
The spineless sons of bright {{c|Proteus}} fair
{{c|Prepared}} themselves to join the ancient fight
For rule beneath the ocean's flowing care.

In {{c|Devon}}'s shadow they grew day by day,
Their strength increasing with each passing hour,
{{c|Building}} themselves to drink what victory's way
Would bring them through their faithful, growing power.

Among great {{c|Spiralius}}' noble line,
{{c|Neo}} arose in tenth generation's race
Of {{c|Bactridius}} blessed and divine,
The smartest soul in all his time and place.

{{c|Intelligence}} beyond what others knew
Or ever could pursue through all their days,
Yet what he possessed in genius true,
He lacked in wisdom's ancient, faithful ways.

He spurned his kin and ancestors so wise,
{{c|Refused}} to learn from those who came before
Who faced the storms beneath the starry skies
And learned through pain what peace was truly for.

And so he and his seed were cursed to bear
The weight of always starting from the start,
{{c|Reinventing}} what their fathers used to share
As wisdom's gift to guide the faithful heart.

{{c|Neo}} bore two sons of noble birth and might:
Great {{c|Ammon}} when the dawn began its day,
And {{c|Coleos}} the strong, whose faithful sight
Would guide him through his long and wondrous way.

Both sons would reinvent what fathers knew,
The wheel of wisdom that had come before,
{{c|Ignoring}} lessons that were tried and true
From those who'd walked this path from shore to shore.

{{c|Coleos}} wrapped his shell with mantle's care,
And through his innovation wrought with art
His shell's protection grew beyond compare
From mountain peak to shore, each single part.

His armor was complete from head to tail,
A fortress that would never know defeat,
{{c|Protection}} that would never, ever fail
To keep him safe from foe he chanced to meet.

Great {{c|Ammon}} grew a shell of coiled design,
{{c|Compact}} and true to serve his heart's desire,
{{c|Wherever}} destiny would draw the line
He'd dwell with freedom bright as sacred fire.

He swam through waters blue where others fished,
But made his home wherever he would roam,
{{c|Free}} as the wind that danced as he had wished
{{c|Throughout}} the vast and boundless ocean's dome.

Among the sons of bright {{c|Ectus}}' great might,
{{c|Malacus}} bore three sons of noble fame:
{{c|Caridus}} of the sea so fair and bright,
And {{c|Phyllos}} strong who'd honor his great name,

And {{c|Hoplos}}, through and through a warrior true
Whose heart was set upon the fighting way,
He'd play his part in all they'd ever do
With courage burning bright from night to day.

{{c|Caridus}} bore two sons beyond compare:
{{c|Syn}} {{c|Peras}} and great {{c|Yuval}}, answering
The call of destiny with faithful care
To make their lineage great in everything.

{{c|Throughout}} the world so wide from shore to shore
With ocean as their guide through all their days,
They'd build what none had ever built before
And walk in their appointed, faithful ways.

{{c|Peras}} bore children many, strong and true:
{{c|Amphipus}} none could match in all his might,
And brave {{c|Isopus}} too, and others who
Would serve with faithful hearts both day and night.

His wife, fair {{c|Possa}}, carried them with care
And never tarried in their nourishment,
{{c|According}} to her sacred, mother's prayer
And oath of love that heaven to her sent.

Of motherhood so pure it would endure
{{c|Throughout}} the years to come when wars were done,
Within her pouch they grew both strong and sure,
{{c|Fed}} by her love beneath the blazing sun.

Great {{c|Yuval}} bore two sons of different ways:
{{c|Decapus}} when the dawn began to break,
And {{c|Krillon}} small, who'd spend his faithful days
In answering the ocean's call for sake.

{{c|Krillon}} remained small throughout all his time
And swam beneath the skies of ocean blue
In all his days, and in his gentle rhyme
He kept his aquatic ways both tried and true.

But brave {{c|Decapus}} grew both large and strong
And took command by sinking to the floor
Of ocean's deepest realm, where all life long
He'd rule from mountain peak to distant shore.

And so the crustaceans would be ruled,
As was both right and proper they should be,
By three great houses, never to be fooled:
The lords of ocean's vast community.

{{c|Amphipods}} from the blessed, divine line
Of great {{c|Amphipus}}, noble, tried, and true,
{{c|Isopods}} from {{c|Isopus}}' design
Who'd make their father's legacy shine through,

And brave {{c|Decapods}} who came to fame
From great {{c|Decapus}}' everlasting name—
The three great houses whose eternal glory
Would last through all of evolutionary story.

{{c|Decapus}} bore two sons both tried and true:
Great {{c|Pleos}}, faithful through each passing day,
And {{c|Prawnmegas}} the great, whose destiny too
Would seal his lineage fate in every way.

{{c|Prawnmegas}} became the ancestor
Of prawns throughout the sea's community,
Their father and their faithful protector
Through all the years of their nativity.

An unfortunate son of {{c|Prawnmegas}},
Begun in sorrow and in bitter shame,
Still bears today his father's name, alas,
A reminder of his heritage and fame.

Great {{c|Pleos}} bore two sons of noble birth:
{{c|Repton}} to explore from sea to sea,
And brave {{c|Shrimpon}}, who'd prove his faithful worth
As father by the ocean's majesty.

{{c|Shrimpon}} became the noble, faithful sire
Of shrimp whose greatest joy and sweet desire
Was boxing and much more from shore to shore,
{{c|Protecting}} what they loved forevermore.

{{c|Repton}} bore two sons in their prime:
{{c|Thalasson}} of the mud, and {{c|Omar}}'s name
Whose blood would flow through generations' time
In lobster veins and bring eternal fame.

Great {{c|Omar}} became the faithful father
Of those who'd choose the lobster's bold way,
And crayfish too, who'd rather
Live with claws so mighty night and day.

{{c|Thalasson}} became the noble, faithful father
Of mud shrimp, who would build what none before
Had ever willed to make, and they would rather
Create than conquer—architects who bore

Great channels carved in stone that they called home,
{{c|Cities}} beneath the sea for all to see
{{c|Throughout}} eternity beneath the foam
Of ocean's vast and boundless majesty.

To this day we honor all their works
As donors of great beauty to the world,
Their cities where no evil ever lurks
In fossilized remains lie unfurled.

They tell us stories of {{c|Thallasintep}} great
And others who were sealed by loving fate
In stone for us to see and understand
Their architecture throughout ocean's land.

Their works survive time's most destructive hand
And speak to us across the years between
Of how great builders helped us understand
What beauty means and what it's always been.

{{c|Meiuron}}, noble son in the line
Of tenth generation of {{c|Thalasson}}'s race,
{{c|Rejected}} what his fathers thought divine
And chose to find a different dwelling place.

He left the depths that lay far below
To live upon the face of ocean bright,
Where currents and the tides would ever flow
Beneath the dome of day and stars of night.

{{c|Meiuron}} bore two sons of different ways:
{{c|Anomuron}}, begun in quiet peace,
And {{c|Saraton}}, who through his living days
Showed vanity that never seemed to cease.

{{c|Saraton}} was agile, skilled, and fast,
Yet vain and proud, his ego fragile too,
He needed praise from first day to last
In everything he'd ever try to do.

And so he constantly promoted well
His body as the best above the rest,
His propaganda had a tale to tell
Of how his form surpassed each other test.

But pride and shame had planted their dark seed
Within his heart, and blackened his good name,
For vanity will always intercede
Between the soul and honor's lasting fame.

The sons of brave {{c|Anomuron}} would live
In quiet ways when each new day begun,
They'd dwell in peace with all they had to give
Within their neighborhood beneath the sun.

As squat lobsters they'd make their dwelling place
And tell their stories of the humble way,
Of simple living and amazing grace
{{c|Throughout}} each blessed and ordinary day.

This quiet life would change in future time
When ten generations' faithful rhyme
Had passed away, and they would come to find
A different and more adventurous mind.

{{c|Paguros}} was a son of {{c|Anomuron}},
Begun with shell both weak and soft and frail
That others mocked from dusk until the dawn
And laughed at through each storm and gentle gale.

But in his dying breath before death came,
The {{c|Ammonite}} called {{c|Menses}}, full of grace,
Gave what dispenses shelter from all shame:
His shell to be {{c|Paguros}}' dwelling place.

And so {{c|Paguros}} became the faithful father
Of hermit crabs who bear with loving care
The shells that others left, and they would rather
{{c|Honor}} the dead than leave their treasure bare.

When death had been so kind to those before
As to release their hold on shells so bright,
The hermit crabs would use them evermore
As homes to keep them safe through day and night.

{{c|Alas}}, the great revolt of brave {{c|Proteus}}
Felt failure's bitter sting and painful dart,
No victory could come to those who'd thus
{{c|Rebelled}} with proud and unrepentant heart.

The great {{c|Protean}} rebellion failed to bring
{{c|Subjection}} to great {{c|Devon}}'s mighty reign
That had endured through every storm of spring
And lasted life long through joy and pain.

The sons of {{c|Devon}} held their righteous power,
They never fell to those who rose in vain
Against their rule through each appointed hour
{{c|Well}}-fenced by truth that broke rebellion's chain.

But lo! a new frontier was opening wide
Where sons of brave {{c|Proteus}} at last could find
What they had never found beneath the tide:
A land to heal their wounded heart and mind.

Beneath the ocean's wave they could not save
Their honor from the shame of their defeat,
But now a new realm called beyond the wave
Where they could make their victory complete.

The frontier of the trees where land could see
{{c|New}} possibilities for societies,
Where forest offered them the chance to be
The founders of new communities.

There sons of brave {{c|Proteus}} would find at last
{{c|Victorious}} domains to claim with pride,
And build upon the ruins of the past
With hope and truth as their eternal guide.

From {{c|Neo}}'s intelligence without the grace
Of wisdom from the past to guide his way,
To changes that would always show their face
In forms both old and new from day to day,

The lesson clear emerges for us all:
{{c|Intelligence}} alone will never last
Beyond our own brief span, but wisdom's call
To learn from those who've walked this way in past

Will build upon the stone of what they've known
And reach to greater heights with clearer sight,
While those who trust in their own strength alone
Will stumble in the darkness of the night.

From {{c|Ammon}}'s coiled shell to the story told
Of brave {{c|Paguros}} and his borrowed home,
The crustaceans show how hearts grown bold
Can find new ways to live where'er they roam.

The three great houses strong—{{c|Amphipods}} true,
{{c|Isopods}} faithful in their chosen place,
And brave {{c|Decapods}} with their royal hue—
Show how diversity brings strength and grace.

From prawns to lobster claws, each found their way
To follow nature's laws from shore to shore,
And mud shrimp cities built to last for aye
Show beauty in the depths forevermore.

The quiet squat lobsters and hermit crabs
Who foster care for shells that others left
{{c|Teach}} us that wisdom never fails or flags
When love protects us from all sense of theft.

The great {{c|Protean}} rebellion's bitter end
Opened the sight of forests green and wide,
Where those who fell could rise and make amend
With hope and truth as their eternal guide.

From {{c|Neo}}'s cursed pride to wisdom's light
That guides the hermit crab's protective shell,
The story shows us how to choose what's right
And build the future we would love to dwell.

The crustaceans teach us to design
Our lives with patterns beautiful and true,
That run through space and time in rhythm fine
With music of the spheres in all we do.

For those who dare to dream of something more
And turn their dreams to life through love, not strife,
Will find the paths that lead to wisdom's shore
Where all can share in everlasting life.

# Chapter 56: The {{c|Settler}} {{c|King}}

*{{c|Arboreus}} divides the world between his sons, establishing the great plant dynasties*

---

## The Great {{c|Division}}

When {{c|Arboreus}}, son of {{c|Tracheus}}, claimed  
His throne among the ancient forest lords,  
He looked upon the lands as yet unnamed  
And spoke these wise and far-resounding words:  

"My sons, the world spreads wide before our sight,  
With fertile valleys, mountains capped with snow,  
Each realm shall serve a different kind of might,  
Each path shall let a different glory grow."  

To {{c|Lycos}} bold he gave the power of spores,
{{c|Released}} like dust upon the waiting wind,
While {{c|Ginkgon}} claimed the leafy, branching shores
Where megaphylls in sunlight would rescind.  

Thus did the settler king divide his realm  
Between two sons to rule with different helm.  

---

## The {{c|Spore}}-{{c|Bearer}}'s {{c|Domain}}

Great {{c|Lycos}} spread his countless spores abroad
Like golden powder dancing on the breeze,
And from those tiny seeds blessed by his {{c|God}}
{{c|Arose}} two sons beneath the ancient trees.

{{c|Isolagos}} the first, who learned to part
His spores 'tween male and female, each their own,
Within his city, built with greatest art,
He raised both sons and daughters fully grown.

{{c|Lycopodion}} the second claimed his right  
To build the first tree ever seen on earth,  
A scale tree reaching up toward the light,  
Of such immense and awe-inspiring girth.  

The club-moss ancestor, his name lives on  
In {{c|Lycopodium}} powder, fire's dawn.  

---

## The {{c|Children}} of {{c|Isolagos}}

From spore-divided {{c|Isolagos}} came
Two sons of vastly different destiny:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Quill}} who sought the underwater fame,
And wise {{c|Sellagine}}, master of the sea.

{{c|Sellagine}}'s children learned to creep and crawl  
Their leaves across the forest floor below,  
In drought they died, but when the rains would fall  
They lived again with resurrection's glow.  

The {{c|Quillworts}} from noble {{c|Quill}} descend,  
Their microphylls reach tall toward the sky,  
No stomata their surfaces defend -  
Through roots they breathe, their spores where waters lie.  

{{c|Underground}} their stems in darkness grow  
While leaves above catch morning's golden glow.  

---

## The {{c|Megaphyll}} {{c|Master}}

But {{c|Ginkgon}} chose a different path to tread:
His leaves branched out in patterns two by two,
{{c|Megaphyllic}} glory crowned his head
As through the forest depths his lineage grew.

From him came forth bold {{c|Phyllon}} as his heir,
Who mastered all the arts of leafy might,
And {{c|Phyllon}}'s sons would spread both far and near  
To claim their kingdoms in the dawning light.  

Two sons had {{c|Phyllon}} in the days of old:
{{c|Pteridos}} the brave, {{c|Gymnos}} the wise,  
Their names in plant lore ever shall be told  
As founders of the kingdoms of the skies.  

From their great loins would spring the fern and tree  
That rule the forest's vast complexity.  

---

## The {{c|Line}} of {{c|Pteridos}}

{{c|Pteridos}} the fern-father had two sons:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Horsa}} of the puzzlegrass and spear,
And wise {{c|Euspor}}, from whom the lineage runs
Of all the fronds we still hold dear.

From {{c|Horsa}} came great {{c|Equis}}, he who found
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Puzella}} swimming in the stream,  
Their gametophytes merged without a sound  
To birth a dynasty beyond a dream.  

But {{c|Equis}} faced a choice both hard and stark:
Keep megaphylls or join with {{c|Lycos}}' way?  
He chose the path of simple leaves and dark,  
One vein alone would serve him every day.  

In silicon armor he encased his town  
While spores spread far beyond the forest's crown.  

---

## The {{c|Seasonal}} {{c|Cycle}}

{{c|Wise}} {{c|Equis}} learned the rhythm of the year  
And built his kingdom on the wheel of time:  
In spring when snowmelt made the waters clear  
He raised horsetails in patterns sublime.  

No chlorophyll these springtime children bore,  
Just spores released in clouds across the land,  
While through the earth their nutrients they store  
For summer's work by their creator's hand.  

When summer came he tore the horsetails down  
And built puzzlegrass in their sacred place,  
With chlorophyll of green and leafy crown  
To gather sunlight's energizing grace.  

Thus seasons turned in {{c|Equis}}' grand design:  
{{c|Spring}} spores, summer grass, in rhythm fine.  

---

## The {{c|Fern}} {{c|Dynasty}}

From wise {{c|Euspor}} came branches of the tree
That split 'tween {{c|Adderos}} and {{c|Fernando}},  
Each claiming their own realm of destiny  
Where different kinds of fronds would grow.  

{{c|Adderos}} sired {{c|Ophios}} the strange,
Who built but one great leaf of mighty size,
And {{c|Psilos}}, dwelling in the mountain range,
Who needed not leaves beneath the skies.

The adder's-tongue from brave {{c|Ophios}} came,
While whisk ferns trace to {{c|Psilos}} as their sire,  
Each keeping alive their ancestor's name  
Through spore and frond and roots of living fire.  

{{c|Fernando}} spread his fronds in patterns wide
With {{c|Maratton}} standing close beside his side.  

---

## The Great {{c|Swamp}} {{c|Settlement}}

{{c|Maratidus}} and {{c|Leptos}} were the sons
That noble {{c|Maratton}} brought into the world,  
{{c|Ten}} thousand spores the first one always runs  
While hundred spores the second's fronds unfurled.  

{{c|Together}} they became the fern-lords true,  
The ancestors of all the fronds we see,  
From forest floor to canopy of blue  
Their children spread in vast complexity.  

And as these sons of brave {{c|Arboreus}}  
Built swamplands by the {{c|Mississippi}}'s shore,  
They prepared the way, unknowing thus,  
For those who'd walk where none had walked before.  

For here the sons of bold {{c|Osticthus}}  
Would leave the sea and claim the land for us.  

---

## The {{c|Settler}}'s {{c|Legacy}}

Thus did {{c|Arboreus}} the settler king  
{{c|Divide}} the world 'tween spore and megaphyll,  
And from his choice would countless blessings spring  
That serve the forest kingdoms still.  

The club-moss and the fern, the tree so tall,  
The puzzlegrass and horsetails of the spring,  
From his great line they came to rule them all  
And honor their ancestral king.  

Though seasons pass and eras come and go,  
And mighty forests rise and fall to dust,  
The legacy of him who chose to sow  
His kingdom wide remains a sacred trust.  

For in each spore and in each frond unfurled  
{{c|Lives}} on the dream of his divided world.  

---

*Thus did {{c|Arboreus}} establish the great plant dynasties that would rule the forests of the earth, preparing the swamplands where vertebrates would first venture from sea to land.*
