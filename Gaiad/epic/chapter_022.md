Now when the children of {{c|35|Nectarius}} had grown,
Each claimed their realm with purpose strong and true.
The paths they'd walk would soon be clearly shown,
As kingdoms spread beneath the ocean blue.

From {{c|284|Plantus}} and fair {{c|286|Cortica}}'s embrace
Came children who would rule the verdant earth.
While {{c|283|Animus}} and {{c|285|Opima}}'s hunting race
Would bring the gift of movement to its birth.

But first let's sing of {{c|287|Plastidus}} the green,
First son of {{c|284|Plantus}} and {{c|286|Cortica}} wise.
His chloroplast bride, fairest ever seen,
Sweet {{c|36|Chlora}}, blessed him with her bright surprise.

From their great union came three children fair:
Bold {{c|288|Glauca}} of the ancient, simple way,
Wise {{c|289|Alges}} with his scientific flair,
And {{c|290|Alga}}, who'd advance from day to day.

Now {{c|288|Glauca}}, eldest daughter of the line,
Kept close her mother's old-fashioned dress
Of peptidoglycan sequins fine,
She chose the path of clonal success.

"Why should I wed," proud {{c|288|Glauca}} declared,
"When I can bear daughters on my own?
No husband's weaknesses need be shared,
My perfect line shall stand alone!"

Her daughters spread like wildfire through the sea,
Billions upon billions, strong and bright.
Each one a perfect copy, wild and free,
Yet bound by ancient ways, both day and night.

But though her numbers swelled beyond all count,
Her simple methods held her back in time.
Without love's gifts that marriage could amount,
She'd never reach complexity's bright climb.

"The future," {{c|288|Glauca}} said with stubborn pride,
"Belongs to those who keep the ancient way."
Yet even as her children multiplied,
The world moved on to more complex display.

Meanwhile brave {{c|290|Alga}} cast tradition down,
And stripped away her peptidoglycan dress.
She built instead a solar, golden crown
Of thylakoids in sophisticated dress.

"I'll not be bound by mother's ancient ways,"
Fair {{c|290|Alga}} spoke with wisdom in her voice.
"The light demands new forms, new nights and days,
Sophistication is my willing choice."

She wed her brother {{c|289|Alges}}, keen and bright,
Together they would revolutionize
The capture of the sun's life-giving light,
And make their solar kingdom truly rise.

From their blessed union came two children bold:
Great {{c|291|Rhodes}}, the red algae's mighty king,
And {{c|292|Vert}}, whose green descendants would unfold
In forests where the songbirds love to sing.

Now {{c|291|Rhodes}} possessed accessory pigments rare,
Phycoerythrin's pink and red so bright.
He caught the deeper wavelengths in the air
That others missed in depths beyond their sight.

"The shallow waters," {{c|291|Rhodes}} proclaimed with pride,
"Are not the only realm where light may dwell.
I'll delve beneath the surface, far and wide,
In crimson depths I'll thrive and prosper well."

His children spread through every coral reef,
Their red and pink pigments blazing bright.
In tropical waters beyond belief,
They painted the seas with pure delight.

But {{c|292|Vert}} chose green chlorophyll as her guide,
And captured blue and red wavelengths true.
"On land," she said, "my children shall reside,
And paint the world in every verdant hue."

From {{c|292|Vert}} would come the great terrestrial line,
The mosses, ferns, and mighty forest trees.
Her simple algae first would intertwine
With fungal partners, mastering the breeze.

But while the plant kingdom found its start,
Fair {{c|296|Hacroses}}, second child of {{c|284|Plantus}}' line,
Would play a very different, vital part
In evolution's intricate design.

{{c|296|Hacroses}} bore two sons of great renown:
Bold {{c|297|Haroses}} and wise {{c|298|Haptistus}} strong.
Their legacy would shake the ocean down
And sing a very different kind of song.

From {{c|297|Haroses}} came three mighty lords:
Great {{c|299|Heterokon}}, master of the brown,
{{c|300|Alveolus}} with his swift-sailing hordes,
And {{c|265|Rhizar}}, bearer of the spiky crown.

Now {{c|299|Heterokon}} bore three sons so bold:
Brave {{c|301|Ochros}} of the golden algae bright,
And {{c|302|Oomy}} with his spines of liquid gold,
And {{c|303|Bigyres}}, swimming in the morning light.

But {{c|301|Ochros}} was the cleverest of all,
He saw fair {{c|304|Rosa}}, daughter of great {{c|291|Rhodes}}.
"Come to my house," he heard love's call,
"And share with me photosynthetic codes."

He stole away sweet {{c|304|Rosa}} from her kin,
And wed her to his cellular embrace.
Within his cytoplasm, locked within,
She found her new endosymbiotic place.

"Now I possess," declared triumphant {{c|301|Ochros}},
"The power of the sun's life-giving ray!
My chloroplast bride, fairest of the roses,
Will feed my line throughout each golden day!"

From this great theft came children without peer:
Fair {{c|305|Diana}} of the silicon art,
Great {{c|306|Kelpus}}, forest-builder without fear,
Sweet {{c|307|Synura}} and {{c|308|Chrysanthema}}'s heart.

{{c|305|Diana}} wed great {{c|309|Silicon}} the strong,
And mastered glass as none had done before.
Her diatom children sang their crystal song,
From Arctic ice to tropical warm shore.

"In shells of glass," {{c|305|Diana}} proudly spoke,
"My daughters shall be beautiful and bright.
No storm or wave will see my lineage broke,
Protected by their armor, pure and white."

Her glassy children filled the ocean wide,
Their geometric beauty without end.
In symmetry and art they took such pride,
That even mathematicians could not comprehend.

Great {{c|306|Kelpus}} chose a different path to fame,
He built great cities in the ocean deep.
His kelp forests earned eternal name,
Where countless sea creatures come to sleep.

"My cities," boasted {{c|306|Kelpus}} with delight,
"Shall tower high like redwoods on the land.
My children, reaching toward the golden light,
Will build the greatest forests ever planned."

His brown algae grew tall as mighty trees,
Creating underwater forests vast.
Through their great fronds swam creatures of the seas,
A living world that ever would last.

But jealousy stirred in the hearts of those
Who lacked the power of photosynthetic might.
Young {{c|300|Alveolus}}, seeking to dispose
Of {{c|301|Ochros}}' monopoly on light.

He stole fair {{c|310|Okra}}, {{c|301|Ochros}}' daughter true,
And made her his endosymbiotic bride.
"Now I too have the power," he said with glee,
"To harness sunshine's energetic tide!"

From this alliance came two children strong:
Bold {{c|311|Cilliofer}} with his beating cilia,
And {{c|312|Myzo}}, vampire all along,
Who'd drink the blood of cellular familia.

{{c|311|Cilliofer}} built cities of his own,
With thousands of cilia beating as one.
His trumpet-shaped descendants, fully grown,
Would dance beneath the early morning sun.

They formed new ways of joining, strange and new,
Called conjugation, mixing genes with art.
Their bell-shaped children, beautiful and true,
Would play their symphony, each playing part.

But {{c|312|Myzo}} took a darker path indeed,
A vampire drinking cellular blood.
He taught his children how to intercede
And drain the life from others' vital flood.

From {{c|312|Myzo}} came dark {{c|53|Dinoflagellus}},
Whose children wear armor, plated strong.
And grim {{c|313|Malarius}}, so treacherous,
Who'd bring disease and suffering long.

{{c|53|Dinoflagellus}} built great armored knights,
Who'd glow with bioluminescent fire.
They'd light the oceans through the darkest nights,
But also bloom in blood-red funeral pyre.

"We are the lights," these warriors declared,
"Who chase away the darkness from the sea.
But we are also warriors who dared
To turn to blood and carnivory."

Their algae fed the corals with their light,
Yet when they bloomed, the waters turned to red.
A paradox of beauty and of blight,
They brought both life and death to ocean's bed.

While grim {{c|313|Malarius}} chose parasitic ways,
His children gave up photosynthetic power.
Instead they'd steal from others all their days,
Malaria their gift in fever's hour.

"Why work," sneered {{c|313|Malarius}} with spite,
"When I can steal from others what I need?
My chloroplasts have lost their power bright,
But I'll survive through parasitic greed."

His apicomplexan descendants still
Invade our blood and bring us disease.
They bend the world unto their evil will,
While honest workers toil without ease.

Meanwhile the Solar Coalition formed,
As those without the light sought ways to gain
The photosynthetic power they had scorned,
But now desired to ease their hungry pain.

{{c|265|Rhizar}} the spiky, {{c|302|Oomy}} with his spines,
And {{c|314|Haptos}} of the haptophyte clan
United their three evolutionary lines
To steal the sun's power if they can.

"We are the sun!" their battle cry rang out,
As they took on a radial shape.
"The power of light we'll win, without a doubt,
From this monopoly we shall escape!"

They built themselves with spines like solar rays,
And called themselves the sun animalcules.
Through many generations, many days,
They'd fight to break photosynthetic rules.

{{c|314|Haptos}} built himself armor bright and strong,
While {{c|315|Helios}} his son consumed with greed.
The mission was both dangerous and long,
But they were driven by their desperate need.

At last young {{c|316|Haptos Junior}} found success,
He stole a daughter of great {{c|301|Ochros}}' line.
The haptophytes could finally progress
With stolen chloroplasts so fine.

But many failed in their ambitious quest,
And {{c|265|Rhizar}}'s children mostly went astray.
Though some would later find their own success,
Most abandoned the solar way.

Yet from their failure came a gift most strange,
For {{c|265|Rhizar}}'s children learned to test and probe.
Their amoeboid forms could rearrange
And explore every corner of the globe.

Meanwhile, far from these struggles for the light,
Great {{c|283|Animus}} and {{c|285|Opima}}'s line
Pursued a path both different and bright,
With movement as their gift divine.

From them came bold {{c|293|Ozymandias}},
Who ruled the unikont domain.
His children would be glorious
And spread through every terrestrial plain.

{{c|293|Ozymandias}} bore two sons apart:
Great {{c|294|Podius}} of the flowing form,
And bitter {{c|295|Metamon}}, with hardened heart,
Who'd face life's every storm.

Poor {{c|295|Metamon}}, consumed by bitter pride,
Refused to wed or take a loving mate.
"I need no mitochondrial guide,
I'll face alone my solitary fate!"

His children, born without their mother's gifts,
Could only live where oxygen was rare.
In anaerobic depths and poisonous rifts,
They'd eke out life with metabolic care.

But {{c|294|Podius}} chose the path of love,
And wed fair maids with mitochondrial might.
His line, blessed by gods above,
Would prosper in the coming light.

From {{c|294|Podius}} came the noble strain
That would divide in generations hence.
One branch would build the fungal domain,
The other, animals with mobile sense.

But this great splitting lies ahead in time,
When complex bodies would at last unfold.
For now, let's end this lengthy rhyme
With kingdoms established, strong and bold.

The children of great {{c|35|Nectarius}} true
Had claimed their realms in ocean, land, and air.
Each lineage, with their retinue,
Would shape the world beyond compare.

The plants had learned to capture solar fire,
The protists filled the seas with forms diverse.
While animals would soon acquire
The gift of movement through the universe.

The great supercontinent Rodinia
Rose from the sea like some vast dream.
Upon its shores, the children of {{c|1|Aster}}'s line
Would build their kingdoms supreme.

Yet even as these realms found peace at last,
Dark {{c|317|Hilluhengweh}} plotted from afar.
The golden age would not forever last,
He'd bring again the chaos and the war.

But that is tale for future songs to tell,
Of how the kingdoms faced their greatest test.
For now, in prosperity they dwell,
Their lineages forever blessed.

So honor {{c|35|Nectarius}} and his bride,
Fair {{c|281|Ambrosia}} of wisdom true.
Their children's gifts would never hide,
But shine forever, bright and new.

From their great love, both proud and strong,
Came every living thing we see.
Their legacy lives on in song,
Throughout all eternity.
