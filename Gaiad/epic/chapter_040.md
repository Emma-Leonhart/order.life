While {{c|Molluscs}} were growing strong
And singing their success song,
We must not forget the foundation
Of {{c|Mithra}}'s great creation.

First {{c|Amaterasu}}'s light
{{c|Blesses}} us both day and night.
A millionth reaches {{c|Terra}}'s seas
To feed life's mysteries.

And so the daughters of {{c|Bacta}}
{{c|Farm}} with light most attracta.
First among them, daughters all
Of {{c|Saya}} answer light's call.

The {{c|Blue}} {{c|Green}} {{c|Algae}} spread
Like living ocean's bread.
They farm the sunlight bright
From dawn until twilight.

The sons of {{c|Viros}} take
Their share for hunger's sake.
From daughters of {{c|Saya}} they steal
To make their viral meal.

And so the viruses were
The predators that were
While daughters of {{c|Saya}} became
The prey in this deadly game.

By viruses came new
{{c|Connections}} strange and true.
A link that none had seen
In life's ancestral scene.

The daughters of {{c|Pelagia}},
Those sisters whose sagia
{{c|Benevolence}} would show
To all who live below,

The mitochondria's kin
Ate remnants thick and thin
Of {{c|Cyanobacteria}}.
Their numbers would hysteria

Create beyond conceiving—
So many past believing
Their multitudes would grow
In waters high and low.

And then there were of old
{{c|Purple}} farmers, brave and bold,
Who came before {{c|Saya}}'s line
With photosynthesis fine.

{{c|Roseobella}}, daughter great
Of {{c|Elah}}'s loving state
Of lesbian motherhood,
Among purple farmers stood

As planimal of the sea
{{c|Living}} wild and free.
She continues to this day
Her photosynthetic way.

Among these bacteria small
And viruses and all
The detritus that fell,
All were consumed well

By great crown-tails so fine,
The {{c|Choanoflagellates}}' line—
Our closest cousins true
In waters deep and blue.

{{c|Alongside}} sons of {{c|Choanos}}
Lived the tiny golden rados:
{{c|Golden}} {{c|Algae}} bright and fair
{{c|Floating}} everywhere.

The sons of {{c|Dinoflagellus}}
Saw prosperity's telltale thus
Of {{c|Chrysalgos}} and {{c|Choanos}},
So they ate both, not manos.

And photosynthesized too
To get more energy through.
They gained more power each day
In their prosperous way.

In their prosperity
Their numbers grew, and see—
The water glowed so bright
In their phototrophic sight.

Their rituals lit the sea
With bioluminescence free.
The ocean sparkled wide
With their phosphorescent pride.

But soon they grew corrupt,
Their morals were abrupt.
The sons of {{c|Dinoflagellus}}
Turned to ways rebellious.

To cannibalism they turned,
While the water burned
{{c|Red}} with carnage from their feast—
They became a bloody beast.

The blood poisoned all
That answered nature's call.
{{c|Whatever}} it would touch
Would suffer very much.

And soon the {{c|Rotifers}}
{{c|Swooped}} in as officers
Of justice from above
With neither hate nor love.

{{c|Consuming}} remnants of
A civilization thereof
That once was great and proud,
The {{c|Rotifers}} ate loud

And grew fat from their meal,
{{c|Saving}} us from the ordeal
Of plague that would have spread
If they had not been fed.

{{c|Xanthus}} the {{c|Dinoflagellate}}
Saw carnage desolate
And fled from his own kind
To leave that death behind.

As he fled he saw afar
The great glass houses, par
{{c|Excellence}} of {{c|Diatoms}}
Who built their holy homes.

{{c|Immune}} to conquest's blight
Of {{c|Rotifers}}' appetite
And sons of {{c|Viros}} too,
The {{c|Diatoms}} lived true

As farmers of the light
{{c|Protected}} day and night
By walls of glass so clear
That kept them without fear.

Then he saw another sight:
{{c|Coccolithophores}} so bright
Who too grew with armor strong
To last their whole life long.

And so he cried out loud
To {{c|Mithra}} from the crowd:
"Why must my line be cursed
To be forever dispersed

Without such protections?
Must I face all rejections
And live life in danger
Like some lonely stranger?"

And then he saw the form
Of refuge from the storm:
{{c|Acanther}}, son of {{c|Radios}},
A starry greenhouse, glorious.

A great greenhouse open wide
For him to come inside.
And so he went within
And found new life begin.

Within {{c|Acanther}}'s frame
He found prosperity's name.
The {{c|Radiolarian}}'s shell
{{c|Protected}} him so well.

As floating greenhouse bright
With glass that caught the light,
They farmed the algae green
In partnership serene.

Meanwhile the green algae
Grew so big, you see,
They found protection true
In numbers, through and through.

{{c|Sargassos}}, {{c|Lord}} of {{c|Kelp}},
Called millions to his help.
He grew a city wide
Of cells on every side.

The greatest of them all
Who answered plankton's call,
His city millions strong
Would last his whole life long.

And so the {{c|Fungi}} came,
The sons of {{c|Chytros}}' name,
To break the great ones down
And earn decomposer's crown.

They ate them and released
A million spores increased
{{c|Throughout}} the watery realm
With {{c|Chytros}} at the helm.

The {{c|Fungi}} are the knights
Who balance nature's rights—
The {{c|Robinhoods}} of sea
Who live quite happily

{{c|Coexisting}} with the line
Of {{c|Oomycetes}} so fine—
The kelp who want to be
{{c|Fungi}} of the sea.

And so they brought the wealth
Of energy and health
To all the little ones
From great ones when day done.

From here the zooplankton
{{c|Emerged}}, their lives begon:
The sons of {{c|Foramer}}
And sons of {{c|Cilliofer}}.

The sons of {{c|Foramer}}
In soils would transfer
Their fishing to the seas
With greatest expertise.

They caught the spores and more—
{{c|Radiolarians}} by score
And all others they could find
Of every shape and kind.

Great shells they built with care
That lasted everywhere.
The snails built their homes
Upon these calcium domes.

The sons of {{c|Cilliofer}}
Were great ones who prefer
To use their cilia
To suck up bacteria

And other tiny food
Into their mouths so good.
With beating hairs they fed
And thus were nourished.

{{c|Tiny}} {{c|Trilobites}} came
To play the hunting game.
They ate the sons of both
{{c|Foramer}} and, by oath,

{{c|Cilliofer}}'s children too,
As predators would do.
The food chain thus was made
Where each their role played.

The sons of {{c|Chordatus}}
{{c|Burrowed}}, most glorious,
Through soil to find the food
That from above renewed

Their bodies' every need.
Through gill slits they would feed,
{{c|Pumping}} water through their frame
To nourish in their name.

Out their atriopores
The water freely pours
When they have taken what
They need from nature's pot.

Great {{c|Chordatus}} begat
Two sons: {{c|Olfacter}} begat
And {{c|Lancelot}} the true
Who traditions knew.

{{c|Lancelot}} continued on
The ways his father's son
Had learned from ancient time
In rhythm and in rhyme.

But {{c|Olfacter}} bore two more:
{{c|Vertebratus}} to explore
The spinal cord's great art,
And {{c|Tunicatus}}' part.

{{c|Vertebratus}} worked each day
To perfect in every way
His spinal cord so fine
With neural design.

But {{c|Tunicatus}} chose
To rest where water flows.
He sat upon a rock
Like shepherd with his flock

And filtered water clean
Through systems never seen.
He pumped so much water through
His filter system grew

To be most of his frame—
{{c|Water}} was his name.
His body became the stream
Of his filtering dream.

{{c|Tunicatus}} bore two sons:
{{c|Larvaceus}} when day begun
And {{c|Ascidaceus}} true
Who different pathways knew.

{{c|Larvaceus}} never stayed
In one place, but made
A giant house of slime
That lasted for all time.

With mucus house so grand
He fished throughout the land
Of water, catching food
In nets of mucus good.

{{c|Ascidaceus}} became
{{c|Ancestor}} of fame
Of {{c|Sea}} {{c|Squirts}} everywhere
Who filter with great care.

A wooden tunic bright
Of cellulose so white
He built around his form
To keep him safe and warm.

His mouth on top would feed,
His atriopore indeed
Would let the water out
When filtering about.

{{c|Ascidaceus}} bore two more:
{{c|Stolidos}} to explore
And {{c|Proteus}} the wise
With penetrating eyes.

{{c|Proteus}} begat in time
{{c|Thallasus}} (so sublime)
And {{c|Enterogon}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

While brethren lived as squirts
{{c|Avoiding}} nature's hurts,
{{c|Thallasus}} built his city
{{c|Floating}} (what a pity

That none could match his art!)
Across the waters' heart.
His city sailed the sea
Most beautifully.

{{c|Thallasus}} bore a son
{{c|Named}} {{c|Dolios}}, lonely one
Who lived his life alone
And made the sea his home.

A solitary life
He lived through joy and strife,
{{c|Fishing}} on his own
Where he had grown.

The {{c|Arrow}} {{c|Worms}} would feed
On {{c|Dolios}} indeed,
As did the {{c|Trilobites}}
And {{c|Jellyfish}}'s bites.

But {{c|Thallasus}} bore more
{{c|Sons}} to explore:
{{c|Pyros}} and {{c|Salpus}} too
Who cities built anew.

{{c|Pyros}} built a tube
So long, like a cube
{{c|Extended}} through the sea—
A city floating free.

{{c|Propelled}} by wastewater
Like some divine daughter
Of engineering's art,
{{c|Playing}} nature's part.

While {{c|Salpus}} built a chain
Through sun and storm and rain
Of beings linked as one
Until their work was done.

From {{c|Amaterasu}}'s light
To creatures of the night,
The foundation firm
Of life's eternal term

Was laid by those who knew
That partnership is true
Between the great and small
Who answer nature's call.

The viruses and bacteria,
The algae's bright hysteria
Of photosynthetic life,
Through harmony, not strife,

Built up the living base
On which each higher race
Would find their nourishment
In ocean's element.

From {{c|Choanoflagellates}}
To {{c|Chordate}}'s vertebrates,
The family tree grew wide
With ocean as their guide.

Each found their special way
To live from day to day:
Some filter, some hunt,
Some do photosynthetic stunt.

But all together made
The grand marine parade
Of life in all its forms
Through calm and raging storms.

The sons of {{c|Chordatus}} show
How spinal cords can grow
To be the foundation true
Of intelligence new.

While {{c|Tunicates}} remind
Us not to be confined
To just one way of life—
{{c|Diversity}} ends strife.

From tiny plankton small
To creatures standing tall,
The ocean's family tree
{{c|Lives}} through eternity.

In every drop of sea
{{c|Lives}} their legacy:
The builders of the base
Of life's eternal grace.
