When {{c|Cambrius}} and {{c|Spriggina}} died,
Great heroes who had ruled with pride,
Two sons were left to claim their throne:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Protos}} and {{c|Dutrus}}, each alone.

Each brother saw a different way
To honor what their parents' legacy would say.
The body plan that they had made
Would be interpreted and obeyed.

Great {{c|Protos}} looked upon the form
And said, "I'll keep the ancient norm.
The first hole is the mouth so wide,
The second is where waste will hide."

"The mesoderm is like the past,
{{c|Mesoglea}} that will last.
My mouth shall bear tentacles bright
Like fathers did in ancient sight."

"O heathen, do you not see
The anus brings us victory?
For generations we did bathe
In filth, but now we are saved!"

"We keep our mouths so clean and pure
And eat food nutritious, sure.
The endoderm, ectoderm, three—
The mesoderm—shall ever be!"

"These layers never shall we mix,
For they're civilization's fix.
The foundation, tried and true,
Shall guide us in all that we do."

But bold {{c|Dutrus}} saw it not the same,
He'd make a different claim:
"The second hole's the mouth, I say,
The first hole takes waste away."

"The mesoderm is something more
{{c|Than}} what we've seen before.
Beyond mesoglea it goes,
Where fisherman and shieldmaid grows."

"A reunion, don't you see,
Of ancient unity?
{{c|Choanoderm}} and {{c|Archaeocyte}}
{{c|Together}} in the fight."

"O heathen, can't you understand?
The mouth is progress' hand!
What we take into our core
{{c|Shapes}} what we have in store."

"What we expel is just the past,
But what we eat will last.
By joining old with new again
We'll build a glorious reign."

And so the war began to rage,
Upon history's page.
Whose vision would define the way
For the {{c|Cambrian}} display?

Each brother bore two sons of might
To join the coming fight:
From {{c|Dutrus}} came both brave and true
{{c|Dietrich}} and {{c|Saccorhytus}} too.

From {{c|Protos}} came with valor high
{{c|Ectus}} and {{c|Spiralius}} nigh.
Four grandsons of the ancient line
Would make their fates align.

{{c|Strange}} {{c|Saccorhytus}} had no rear,
No anus did appear.
With no way to expel his waste,
His life would not be graced.

So {{c|Dutrus}}' legacy fell
To {{c|Dietrich}}, who served him well.
The loyal son would carry on
Until his life was done.

The sons of {{c|Dutrus}}, it was known,
{{c|Throughout}} the world had grown
{{c|Famous}} for their heads so wise,
But {{c|Dietrich}} had no eyes.

No head had he to lead the way,
But innovation saved the day.
He built himself a tail so strong
To move his life along.

Through muddy ground he made his path
{{c|Avoiding}} others' wrath.
With two nerve cords to guide his course
He found prosperity's source.

He settled down and built a home,
A colony where he could roam.
His simple plan worked very well
In his ancestral dell.

Great {{c|Spiralius}} kept the faith
And avoided common wraith.
He built his city like a top,
A trochophore that would not stop.

With tentacles both long and wide
He fished from side to side.
No fisherman had been before
As skilled upon the shore.

His wealth grew day by day
In his prosperous way.
The trochophore design proved true
For all that he would do.

But {{c|Ectus}} was a bitter soul,
{{c|Resentment}} was his goal.
The secondborn who felt the slight
Would make his grievance right.

"I'll be the greatest of them all,"
He answered duty's call.
"Among {{c|Cambrius}}' sons I'll shine
And make the victory mine."

His tentacles he changed to teeth,
{{c|Ferocious}} underneath.
He shed his skin to stay young,
While battle songs were sung.

With muscles strong and flexing true
He leaped at all he knew.
His prey would never get away
From {{c|Ectus}}' fierce display.

"O eldest sons, beware!" he cried,
"Take caution in your pride!
The legacy belongs to those
Who defeat all their foes!"

And so he declared a war
That would spread both near and far.
Against {{c|Dutrus}} and {{c|Spiralius}} both
He swore his solemn oath.

The sons of {{c|Dutrus}}, brave and true,
The sons of {{c|Spiralius}} too,
And {{c|Ectus}} with his fearsome might
{{c|Prepared}} for the great fight.

These three great tribes would write
The story of their sight.
Their conflict would define the age
On evolution's stage.

And so began that time of fame
When diversity's flame
{{c|Burned}} bright across the ancient sea:
The {{c|Cambrian}}'s legacy.

{{c|Bodies}} burst in forms unknown,
As each tribe made their throne.
{{c|Innovations}} everywhere
{{c|Filled}} the water and the air.

{{c|Predator}} and prey alike
{{c|Prepared}} for war to strike.
{{c|Arms}} races would begin
As each sought to win.

The filter feeders found their place
While hunters gave chase.
Some burrowed deep in mud
While others spilled their blood.

{{c|Eyes}} evolved to see the light,
{{c|Shells}} appeared for the fight.
{{c|Claws}} and spines and armor thick
Made survival's trick.

The explosion had begun
{{c|Underneath}} the ancient sun.
{{c|Cambrius}}' legacy lived on
From dusk until the dawn.

In every creature that we see
{{c|Lives}} this ancient memory:
The choice between the old and new
{{c|Shapes}} all that we do.

Some kept the ancient, simple way
While others chose to stay
{{c|Innovative}}, bold, and bright
In evolution's sight.

The war between the brothers three
{{c|Lives}} on in you and me.
In every choice we make each day
We follow their display.

{{c|Innovation}} or tradition,
Each makes its submission
To the force of life that drives
All that grows and thrives.

So honor brave {{c|Cambrius}},
Who started all this fuss.
His legacy lives on today
In every living way.

The {{c|Cambrian}} explosion's fire
{{c|Burns}} on with desire
In every form of life we see
Through all eternity.
