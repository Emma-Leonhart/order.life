From {{c|Luca}}'s lineage, two daughters sprang,
{{c|Arka}} and {{c|Bacta}}, shaped to change the world;
In marshy cradles, where their voices rang,
Their stories intertwined, their fates unfurled.

{{c|Arka}}, the fearless, ventured far and wide,
{{c|Exploring}} {{c|Terra}}'s depths and mysteries;
Her courage blazed, a beacon and a guide,
Upon her path, the sisters placed their pleas.

And {{c|Bacta}}, strong, adaptable, and keen,
Faced trials and change with steady resilience;
In her, the sisters found a fortress sheen,
A bastion of strength and firm compliance.

{{c|United}}, these descendants of {{c|Bios}}' grace,
{{c|Embarked}} upon their journey through the strife;
With {{c|Arka}}'s questing soul and {{c|Bacta}}'s pace,
They forged ahead to carve a future life.

One moonlit eve, as {{c|Luna}} graced the sky,
Her voice rang clear to {{c|Luca}}, filled with light;
A prophecy she whispered from on high,
To share with both her daughters in the night.

"My child, your daughters shall divide the {{c|Earth}};
Two realms will rise beneath their guiding hands.
From your own lineage, life shall find rebirth,
A testament to your creation's plans.

{{c|Arka}}'s domain shall spread with wandering feet,
{{c|Exploring}} lands unseen by mortal eyes;
Her children brave and bold shall fears defeat,
{{c|Discovering}} where hidden beauty lies.

And {{c|Bacta}}'s kin, resilient they'll remain,
{{c|Adapting}} to the ever-changing world;
They'll hold their ground through hardship and through pain,
Their legacy's banner never furled."

With {{c|Luna}}'s words, a promise made to keep,
{{c|Luca}}, both hopeful and yet filled with care,
{{c|Gazed}} at her daughters, pondering paths deep,
Of two great realms their destinies would bear.

From north to south, these sacred temples stood,
In distant lands, their purpose to fulfill;
With fervent prayers and rites, they understood
The bond between their people and {{c|Earth}}'s will.

In {{c|Isua}}, where {{c|Greenland}}'s cold winds blow,
And {{c|Acasta}}'s {{c|Northwest}} {{c|Territories}},
The Great {{c|Temple}} thrived in ice and snow,
A testament to ancient legacies.

While far away, the {{c|Zircon}} {{c|Temple}} gleamed
In {{c|Jack}} {{c|Hills}} under {{c|Australian}} sun;
And {{c|Barberton}}, where life first stirred and dreamed,
The temples' influence had just begun.

From {{c|Arka}} sprang a lineage of might:
{{c|Dipana}}, {{c|Yuri}}, {{c|Proteus}} arose;
Their daughters ventured forth into the light,
To every corner where the wind now blows.

{{c|Dipana}}'s kin, a multitude so grand,
{{c|Inhabited}} {{c|Earth}}'s edges far and wide;
{{c|Yuri}} {{c|Archaea}}, leading her band—
{{c|Methana}}, {{c|Halo}}, {{c|Pyra}} at her side.

{{c|Methana}}, consort to {{c|Methanius}} fair,
In methane's arts her mastery was shown;
{{c|Halo}} the {{c|Purple}}, with seductive flair,
Won {{c|Salta}}, {{c|Sol}}, and {{c|Carotenus}}' throne.

{{c|Deep}} purple hues she harnessed from the sun,
With {{c|Carotenus}}' colors intertwined;
In salty realms, her daughters dwelt as one,
While {{c|Proteus}}' offspring spread unconfined.

Among them, {{c|Asgarda}} held the throne,
And from her sprang a million daughters strong:
{{c|Heimdalla}}, {{c|Odina}}, {{c|Thora}} known,
With {{c|Lokia}} and {{c|Hela}} in their throng.

{{c|Heimdalla}}, watchful guardian of the realm;
{{c|Odina}}, keeper of all wisdom's light;
And {{c|Thora}}, whose great strength could overwhelm;
While {{c|Lokia}} stirred up chaos and delight.

Then {{c|Hela}}, dwelling in the shadow's veil,
Her secrets buried deep within the night;
An epic lineage woven without fail,
Their tales of strength and cunning brought to sight.

An epic lineage, these daughters bold,
Their stories echo through the halls of time;
From {{c|Luca}}'s line, their destinies unfold,
A tapestry of life, profound, sublime.

Through trials faced and victories hard-won,
They forged ahead to shape their universe;
The legacy of {{c|Bios}} carried on,
In every deed, in every whispered verse.

With {{c|Luna}}'s elixir waiting in the skies,
They journeyed forth, their faith forever strong;
{{c|Awaiting}} when the stars would align their ties,
To drink immortal life and join the song.

Across the cosmos, endless paths they roam,
The daughters of the {{c|Earth}} and {{c|Moon}} combined;
{{c|Forever}} seeking, ever moving home,
Their fates with threads of destiny entwined.
