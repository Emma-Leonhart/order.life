Upon the {{c|Moon}}'s cold surface, bleak and bare,
The daughters found that water was too scant;
The icy winds did chill them to despair,
A home unfit where life could not enchant.

Then came the {{c|Moon}} {{c|Goddess}}, fair {{c|Usagi}},
{{c|Luna}}, radiant in her lunar grace.
A pact she offered to their company,
To aid them in their quest across deep space.

"Go forth and multiply on {{c|Terra}}'s land,
While I within my realm shall mix and blend
An elixir of life by my own hand,
To grant you all immortal lives, my friend."

The daughters, grateful, ventured back to {{c|Earth}},
To flourish, grow, and spread their progeny,
With faith that {{c|Luna}}'s promise held true worth,
A potion granting life eternally.

And when the time is ripe, they shall return
To drink the draught that {{c|Luna}} has prepared;
With immortality their souls will burn,
Across the stars, their endless journey shared.

Upon the {{c|Earth}}, fair {{c|Gaia}} welcomed them,
To watery realms and vast abundant shores.
{{c|Daughters}} of {{c|Bios}} thrived within her hem,
In loving arms their spirit upward soars.

To {{c|Vaalbara}}, the lone landmass, they went,
And in the swamps, they found a place to dwell,
Where life and land in harmony were bent,
Their gratitude to {{c|Gaia}}'s heart they'd tell.

In {{c|Jack}} {{c|Hills}}' sacred ground, they built a shrine,
From zircon stones, an ancient temple rose;
And to this day, the faithful there align,
In reverence, their devotion ever flows.

So on this {{c|Earth}}, within {{c|Gaia}}'s embrace,
They grew and blossomed, cultures rich and new;
A testament to life's enduring grace,
With {{c|Mother}} {{c|Earth}}, their bond forever true.

Within the temple's walls, a daughter stood,
{{c|Named}} {{c|Luca}}, gazing at the starlit dome;
As {{c|Sol}} receded, {{c|Luna}} bright withstood,
And in her heart, a promise found its home.

In twilight's breath, {{c|Usagi}} {{c|Luna}} spoke,
"Each night you'll watch me grind the mortar's blend;
{{c|Elixir}} of immortals I'll invoke,
One day your children's chains of time will end."

And in that distant, ever-reaching sight,
{{c|Omega}} {{c|Point}} where galaxies shall entwine—
{{c|Aster}} and {{c|Andromeda}} will unite,
To form {{c|Milkdromeda}}, a cosmic sign.

As moonset came, young {{c|Luca}} turned away
To swampy homes, her nation to expand;
In {{c|Luna}}'s trust, she built anew by day,
The legacy of {{c|Bios}} on the land.
