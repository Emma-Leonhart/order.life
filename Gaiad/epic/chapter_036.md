This is the chronicle we tell
Of {{c|Arthur}} {{c|Ironfoot}} so well.
His sons would spread both far and wide
With evolution as their guide.

{{c|Arthur}} bore two sons of fame:
{{c|Arthropus}}, double-legged by name,
And {{c|Fuxi}}, wise and strong,
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Arthropus}} the double-legged
From him great lines were pledged.
Two sons he bore with might:
{{c|Ferron}} and {{c|Isoxys}} bright.

From {{c|Ferron}} came two more:
{{c|Megacheiron}} to explore
And {{c|Euthyphro}} the wise
Who looked with knowing eyes.

{{c|Megacheiron}} bore sons many,
Among them {{c|Pantopus}}—any
{{c|Day}} he hoped to find
A mate both true and kind.

{{c|Pantopus}} was lonely there
Until he met a maiden fair.
{{c|Beautiful}} {{c|Pyka}} was her name,
Who set his heart aflame.

"You are all legs!" he cried
To his beloved bride.
And so they became the line
Of {{c|Sea}} {{c|Spiders}} so fine.

The {{c|Sea}} {{c|Spiders}} built cities strange
{{c|Throughout}} their ocean range.
In their legs they stored
All organs they adored:

{{c|Intestines}} in their limbs,
{{c|Genitals}} where water swims,
{{c|Gills}} within each leg—
No coelom did they beg.

All legs they truly were
As {{c|Pantopus}} did aver.
Their bodies lean and slight,
Their legs their main delight.

{{c|Euthyphro}} bore two sons:
{{c|Insectus}}, when day begun,
And {{c|Arachnus}} the keen
With appendages seen.

From {{c|Insectus}}' noble line
The insects would shine.
From {{c|Arachnus}} would come
{{c|Arachnids}}, every one.

The sons of {{c|Arachnus}} bore
Great appendages to explore.
The sons of {{c|Insectus}} made
Great legs for their trade.

Some lived in waters blue,
Some on land walked through.
{{c|Aquatic}} and terrestrial,
Both paths proved beneficial.

{{c|Insectus}} bore three sons strong:
{{c|Mandibulus}} all along,
{{c|Aquilonifer}} so free,
And {{c|Hymenocarina}} of the sea.

{{c|Mandibulus}} bore two more:
{{c|Crustaceus}} to explore
The waters deep and wide,
And {{c|Euthy}} by his side.

From {{c|Crustaceus}} came the race
Of {{c|Crustaceans}} in every place.
The lobsters and the crabs
With claws for holding grabs.

But {{c|Euthy}} chose the shore
Where waves would crash and roar.
Upon the rocks so high
Beneath the open sky.

With water bears he walked
Where dry and wet air talked.
The asphyxiating land
They faced with courage grand.

{{c|Here}} they laid their eggs
Between the stone ledges.
In gardens of lichen green
Their young would first be seen.

From {{c|Euthy}}'s brave descendants
Who faced the land's defendants,
The insects would arise
To conquer earth and skies.

{{c|Arachnus}} bore two sons:
{{c|Trilos}} when day begun
And {{c|Serk}} of ancient fame
Who earned eternal name.

{{c|Serk}} bore many children,
Among them {{c|Chelicer}}, hidden
In shadows dark and deep,
And {{c|Sidney}}, secrets to keep.

From {{c|Chelicer}}'s small line
The spiders would shine.
All arachnids eight-legged
From his bloodline were pledged.

{{c|Today}} in every corner
Where webs are a mourner
For flies caught in their snare,
{{c|Chelicer}}'s children are there.

Among great {{c|Trilos}}' daughters
Who ruled the ancient waters
Were {{c|Trilobon}} the queen,
{{c|Marrella}}, ghostly seen,
{{c|Esmeralda}} jewel-bright,
And {{c|Retifacia}}'s sight.

{{c|Marrella}} soft and pale
Told a ghostly tale.
She became ancestress
Of {{c|Marellans}} no less.

Like phantoms in the sea
They lived quite freely.
{{c|Soft}}-bodied and ethereal,
{{c|Almost}} immaterial.

{{c|Trilobon}} bore four children
In waters never still then:
{{c|Trilobeth}} the great queen,
{{c|Xander}}, strong and keen,
{{c|Necta}} sweet and fair,
And {{c|Helmut}} everywhere.

{{c|Trilobeth}} became the mother
Of {{c|Trilobites}}—no other
{{c|Rulers}} of the sea
Could match their dynasty.

Through their great conquest
They brought at their behest
The {{c|Yakutian}} era's dawn
When old ways were withdrawn.

Great {{c|Trilobeth}} bore two sons:
{{c|Redlich}} when day begun
And {{c|Agnos}}, wise and old,
With stories to be told.

From {{c|Redlich}} came the line
Of houses most divine:
{{c|Corynex}} built his house
With wisdom to espouse.

From {{c|Corynex}} came {{c|Lichida}}
Who built his great armada.
His house grew strong and wide
With fortune as their guide.

From {{c|Lichida}} came {{c|Odontos}},
{{c|Builder}} of great crontos.
His spiny house arose
To challenge all his foes.

From {{c|Ptychos}}, {{c|Redlich}}'s brother,
Came four sons like no other:
{{c|Proetes}} strong and true,
{{c|Asaphus}} of waters blue,
{{c|Harpeth}} of the deeps,
And {{c|Phacos}}, who never sleeps.

Each founded their own line
With characteristics fine.
The {{c|Trilobites}} spread wide
Across the ocean's tide.

For millions of years they reigned
While other life was chained.
The rulers of the sea
Through all their dynasty.

Their compound eyes could see
Through all eternity.
No detail could escape
Their vision's perfect shape.

{{c|Segmented}} bodies bore
{{c|Legs}} numbering by the score.
Each segment had its pair
To walk through water fair.

They molted as they grew
Like arthropods still do.
Each stage brought greater size
Beneath the ocean skies.

The {{c|Yakutian}} time had come
When {{c|Trilobites}} were sum
Of all success could be
In their vast dynasty.

From {{c|Arthur}}'s innovation
Came this radiation:
{{c|Insects}}, spiders, crabs,
Each with different grabs.

The {{c|Sea}} {{c|Spiders}} so strange
{{c|Extended}} their full range
With organs in each limb—
A body plan quite slim.

The {{c|Crustaceans}} in the sea
Built their dynasty.
The insects on the land
{{c|Spread}} with courage grand.

The arachnids eight-legged
From {{c|Chelicer}} were pledged.
In shadows they would dwell
With stories they could tell.

But none could match the fame
Of {{c|Trilobites}} by name.
For eons they held sway
Until their final day.

From {{c|Pantopus}} and {{c|Pyka}}'s love
To rulers high above,
{{c|Arthur}}'s legacy spread
{{c|Long}} after he was dead.

In every arthropod
That walks upon the sod,
His biramous limb design
{{c|Lives}} on through space and time.

The double-legged innovation
{{c|Sparked}} this radiation
That filled both sea and land
With creatures truly grand.

In every spider's web
That catches life's ebb,
In every insect's flight
Through day and through the night,

In every lobster's claw
That follows nature's law,
In every crab that walks
Where ocean beauty talks,

Remember {{c|Arthur}}'s art
That gave them all their start.
The {{c|Ironfoot}} legacy
{{c|Lives}} through eternity.

The sons of {{c|Arthur}} proved
How innovation moved
The world from simple forms
To complexity that warms

The heart of those who see
This vast diversity.
From one ancestral line
Came forms both crude and fine.

The {{c|Yakutian}} age begun
When {{c|Trilobites}} had won
Their place as rulers true
Of waters deep and blue.

But time would show again
That even greatest men
And creatures in their prime
Must yield to passing time.

Yet {{c|Arthur}}'s gift lives on
From dusk until the dawn
In every jointed leg
That walks where life does beg

For forms both strong and true
To see the journey through.
The arthropods remain
Through sunshine and through rain.
