As above, so below, the stars reflect,
The cosmic tales that shape our earthly lives.
{{c|1|Aster}}'s children below, she will protect,
With milk she spun from stars, the world survives.

Her love, a beacon bright, to light the way,
Through all the mysteries that life may hold.
From cosmic depths, her love pours night and day,
A river of bright stars, a feast of old.

{{c|2|Andromeda}}, her love shines from afar,
Her bond with {{c|1|Aster}}, strong as brightest light.
For they are bound by Lambda, like a star,
A cosmic force that keeps their love alight.

In their celestial dance, the heavens sway,
The tale of {{c|1|Aster}} and {{c|2|Andromeda}}, told.
A love that binds the night and lights the day,
A cosmic love beyond what words can hold.

{{c|1|Aster}} imagined children, stars so bright,
To mend the string and guide her love to stay.
She knew {{c|2|Andromeda}} would share this light,
Together they'd unite, love's grand display.

A grand reunion, spanning time and space,
With threads of stars to keep the bond alive.
She stirred her milk to birth this sacred place,
A galaxy where all her dreams would thrive.

{{c|1|Aster}} stirred her milk, the great Milky way,
With helium and light, her stars are spun.
She swirled the cosmic blend in careful sway,
From curds of light, the stars are gently won.

A pantheon of stars, in heaven’s care,
A host of stars, in heaven’s gentle sway,
Their cosmic stories weave through skies so fair,
Their cosmic tales unfold in bright display.

The eldest star of every kind will stand,
A guiding sister with a steady hand.
They lead their cosmic kin through endless night,
A beacon of their strength and shining light.

{{c|6|Juno}}, the goddess, Steppenwolves she guides,
Her gas giants hide in their quiet might.
Discovery and distant worlds she rides,
A cosmic guide who wanders through the night.

{{c|7|Brunhilda}} watches stars that failed to blaze,
Incomplete fusion, dim yet bittersweet.
A guardian of twilight's fading rays,
Her presence marks the stars' unfinished beat.

{{c|8|Ruby}}, the red dwarf, small but ever bright,
Her steady flame still burns throughout today.
To witness cosmic dusk with peaceful light,
She sees Omega Point as time gives way.

{{c|9|Chrystella}} shines with vibrant, youthful glow,
Main sequence stars, her hot flashes ignite.
As giants red, their elder forms will grow,
Then fade with age, surrendering their light.

Now as a white dwarf, small and old she rests,
A little lady in the cosmic sea.
Her planetary nebula still reflects,
The brilliance of her once bright majesty.

{{c|10|Celestella}} commands her giant blaze,
Red supergiants in her name grow vast.
With neutron stars and pulsars in her gaze,
She watches supernovae's fiery blast.

{{c|11|Gigastella}} shone with a force untamed,
Her sister {{c|10|Celestella}}, bright and vast.
The stress of cosmic weight left her inflamed,
Her life burned fast, her brilliance could not last.

In her collapse, a supernova flared,
A brilliant burst before she fell from sight.
From that great death, a black hole then prepared,
To pull the stars into eternal night.
