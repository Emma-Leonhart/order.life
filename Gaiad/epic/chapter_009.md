Upon the moon {{c|Phaestia}}, life did bloom,
It circled {{c|Vayu}}, underneath the sun.
{{c|Aster}}, by Ehēca's light, dispelled the gloom,
Her guiding hand ensured all life begun.

{{c|People}} of {{c|Phaestia}}, blessed by her hand,
{{c|Knew}} many names for {{c|Aster}} in their lore.
Her power felt in sky, in sea, and land,
Her essence woven deep in every core.

By many titles did the stars proclaim
The goddess who had given life its start.
They honored her with reverence and great flame,
For {{c|Aster}} lived within each beating heart.

She ruled the oceans vast with gentle hand,
{{c|Empress}} of cosmic waters, {{c|Suiten}}.
The star that guides the lost through every land,
The Great {{c|Empress}} of the {{c|North}} {{c|Star}}, {{c|Myoken}}.

From supernova’s heart, she forged with might,
{{c|Cosmic}} metals shaping, {{c|Konjin}}-sama.
The breath of life that fills the endless night,
The great creatrix of all worlds, {{c|Brahma}}.

Her light that spreads across the cosmic span,
The goddess of all space, {{c|Vairocana}}.
She holds the deepest void beyond the plan,
The keeper of the dark, {{c|Saint}} {{c|Varuna}}.

In the deep waters, creatures thrived and grew,
From microbes small to beasts of wondrous size.
The seas, a dance of vibrant cosmic hue,
{{c|Aster}}'s love beneath the bright starry skies.

Beneath the waves, lush forests swayed and danced,
With creatures vast in harmony they roamed.
A tapestry of life, by fate enhanced,
A refuge for the lost, a world well-homed.

But all things change, for even stars grow cold,
The moon's tranquility would not remain.
Beneath {{c|Phaestia}}'s seas, the earth turned bold,
And signs of strife began to stir again.

A mighty tremor shook the ocean floor,
{{c|Volcanoes}} rose with fury in their wake.
{{c|Lava}} and ash consumed the peaceful shore,
As fiery wrath made all of {{c|Phaestia}} quake.

The fiery force burst forth with blinding light,
A torrent born of deep volcanic pain.
The sky grew dark beneath the ash-filled night,
As lava scorched the land and boiled the rain.

The oceans churned, and life was swept away,
Yet in the chaos, hope began to rise.
The cyborgs, built by {{c|Aster}}, found their way,
Their metal forms resilient to demise.

{{c|Propelled}} by force beyond their world’s control,
The cyborgs drifted, cast to distant stars.
Through starlit realms, their shattered moon’s last soul
Would venture far beyond its cosmic scars.
