*Aquarius 18 - Chapter 46 of 364*

## Chapter Content Summary
This chapter chronicles the epic war between Bivalves and Brachiopods during the Great Ordovician Diversification, representing innovation versus tradition in marine ecosystems. It details the genealogies of both groups while hinting at a greater catastrophic threat approaching that will dwarf their conflicts.

## The Great War Setup
### Spiralian Conflict

#### Discinidus's Variation
- **Smaller Design**: "Was smaller when begun his life, and more like clam than traditional lamb"
- **Departure from Norm**: Moving away from classic brachiopod form

### Calciatus's Contrasting Sons
#### Craniidus the Tailless
- **Anatomical Loss**: "Who'd never have a tail, but ever live without that sign of his ancestral line"
- **Simplification**: Reduction rather than elaboration

#### Articulus the Builder
- **Mass Production**: "Built cheap but built true his children without thought of what tradition brought"
- **Larval Innovation**: "Without anuses, they were blobs...but answered metamorphosis' call"
- **Rapid Development**: "In just an instant's time to change their paradigm from blob to something more"

## The Escalating Conflict
### Military Scale
- **Formidable Forces**: "The sons of Articulus were numerous and thus a formidable force"
- **Conquest Campaign**: "Against the Bivalve course of conquest through the seas"
- **Territorial War**: "Where they did as they please and took what they could take"

### Irreconcilable Differences
