*Capricorn 7 - Chapter 33 of 364*

## Chapter Content Summary
This chapter chronicles Spiralius, the most conservative of the three patriarchs, who maintained traditional feeding methods while his descendants diversified into various jaw-bearing lineages. It traces the evolution from simple tentacle feeding to complex jaw systems, leading to modern rotifers and chaetognaths (arrow worms).
