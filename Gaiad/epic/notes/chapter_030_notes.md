# Chapter 030 Notes: Snowball Earth Begins
*Capricorn 4 - Chapter 30 of 364*

## Chapter Content Summary
This chapter chronicles the evolution of cnidarians (jellyfish, corals, sea anemones) through the lineage of Cnider, who established radial symmetry and multiple feeding mouths. It details the diversification into sessile polyps and free-swimming medusae, culminating in complex jellyfish with sophisticated eyes and swimming abilities.

## Cnider's Establishment
### Basic Body Plan
- **Rocky Throne**: "Sat upon a rock so wide"
- **Multiple Mouths**: "Built on each side of his throne a row of mouths, his very own"
- **Tentacle System**: "Tentacles reaching down below, a great column all aglow"
- **Siphonoglyph**: "Fishermen in lines he placed...down each mouth, with skillful art"

### Lunar Covenant
- **Sacred Pact**: "Cnider made a sacred pact with Luna"
- **Reproductive Timing**: "On the full moon he bore two"
- **Continuing Pattern**: "To this day when Luna's face shines full...their reproductive matters settle"
- **Tidal Coordination**: "The tidal pull, the silver beam fulfill their reproductive dream"

## Cnider's Two Sons
### Anthus (Traditional)
- **Conservative Path**: "Kept the ancient way, following tradition's display"
- **Sessile Lifestyle**: "Children built their homes on stone and never far from land they'd roam"
- **Ancestral Form**: Representing polyp/anemone lineage

### Anaxydros (Innovative)
- **Change Agent**: "Chose to change, his innovations were strange"
- **Two Descendants**: Pompom and Meduson
- **Evolutionary Branching**: Leading to diverse cnidarian forms

## Pompom's Stalked Lineage
### Bottom-Dwelling Strategy
- **Stalked Path**: "Chose the stalked path, to weather time and nature's wrath"
- **Ocean Floor**: "Built upon the ocean floor and opened innovation's door"
- **Two Sons**: Conos and Stauros - "stalked jellyfish they became"
- **Evolutionary Innovation**: Intermediate forms between polyps and medusae

## Meduson's Swimming Revolution
### Floating City Innovation
- **New Lifestyle**: "Would not on the bottom stay"
- **Floating City**: "His city floated in the sea, drifting wild and drifting free"
- **Jellyfish Ancestor**: "The ancestor of jellyfish, he granted their floating wish"

### Swimming Development
- **Initial Drift**: "At first he had no direction, just aimless drift without connection"
- **Innovation**: "Why should I drift where currents go? I'll pump and swim both high and low!"
- **Jet Propulsion**: "Learned to pump his body tight and shoot through water with delight"
- **Active Movement**: Transition from passive drift to active swimming

## Anthus's Sessile Descendants
### Anemones
- **Floral Mimicry**: "Anemones, who swayed like flowered trees"
- **Stationary Lifestyle**: Remaining attached to substrate
- **Predatory Strategy**: Using tentacles for capture

### Corals
- **City Builders**: "Corals built their cities grand upon the ocean's shifting sand"
- **Symbiotic Farming**: "With Zooxanthellae they'd farm and keep their cities free from harm"
- **Photosynthetic Partnership**: "Zoochlorellae, green and bright, helped them capture morning light"
- **Reef Construction**: "These partnerships would make the reefs for others' sake"

## Meduson's Swimming Descendants
### Diplos and Jelly
- **Evolutionary Split**: "From Meduson came children two: Bold Diplos and sweet Jelly true"
- **Different Strategies**: "Each would take a different path through ocean's joy and wrath"

### Jelly's Two Lineages
#### Cubozoans (Box Jellyfish)
- **Box Shape**: "Cubozoans, box-shaped, wise, who learned to use their eyes"
- **Advanced Vision**: "Eyes of Cubos, complex, true, could see through waters blue"
- **Sophisticated Sight**: "No simple spots of light were these, but eyes that truly seize"
- **Parental Care**: "Cubos was a father kind...He bore but few children dear"

#### Scyphozoans (True Jellyfish)
- **Large Numbers**: "Sons of Scyphos numbered high...Each polyp bore a myriad young"
- **Diverse Forms**: Pacific Sea Nettle with "trailing tentacles so long"
- **Predator Deterrent**: "Made predators think twice"
- **Ocean Wanderers**: Granting "many a sailor's wish to see their beauty in the deep"
