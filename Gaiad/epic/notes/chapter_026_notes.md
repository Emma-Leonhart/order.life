# Chapter 026 Notes: The Sponge Kingdom
*Aquarius 26 - Chapter 26 of 364*

## Chapter Content Summary
This chapter chronicles the evolution of the first true animals (sponges) from the Animal Kingdom established by Metazo and Anima. It traces the development of increasingly complex sponge architectures through the lineages of Therion's three sons, focusing particularly on Porifer's line. The narrative includes the tragic story of Vitrius (glass sponges) and his fratricide, leading to Spongius's wisdom about pride and humility, and culminates in the diversification of modern sponge groups.

## The Three Great Kingdoms
### Eukaryotic Triumvirate
- **Plant Kingdom**: "The Kingdom of proud Plantus rose, where photosynthetic glory grows"
- **Fungal Kingdom**: "The realm of Mygus, where fungus flows"
