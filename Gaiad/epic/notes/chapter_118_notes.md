# Chapter 118 Notes: The Afrotherians
*Aries 6 - Pre-Human Animal Chapters - Stage III (Placental Foundations)*

## Arc Overview
- **Chapter 6 of 17**: Pre-Human Animal Chapters (Cenozoic arc)
- **Stage III**: Placental Foundations (Chapters 117-118)
- **Timeline**: Paleocene-Miocene (~66-5 million years ago)
- **Location**: Africa, with later dispersals to other continents

## Major Events
### African Radiation
- **Elephants**: Proboscidean giants developing intelligence and social complexity
- **Hyraxes**: Small rock-dwelling relatives of elephants
- **Aardvarks**: Specialized ant and termite hunters
- **Manatees**: Aquatic adaptation of African lineage

### Elephant Evolution
- **Size increase**: From small early forms to massive modern elephants
- **Trunk development**: Proboscis becoming versatile manipulation tool
- **Social intelligence**: Complex family structures and communication
- **Memory systems**: Advanced cognitive abilities and cultural transmission

### Aquatic Adaptations
- **Sirenian evolution**: Manatees and dugongs adapting to marine life
- **Dugong specialization**: Seagrass feeding and coastal habitats
- **Manatee expansion**: River and coastal environments
- **Aquatic gigantism**: Large body sizes in water

### Ecological Specialization
- **Aardvark lifestyle**: Nocturnal insectivore with powerful digging
- **Hyrax social systems**: Colonial living and complex vocalizations
- **Elephant engineering**: Landscape modification through feeding and movement
- **Pollination services**: Large mammals as seed dispersers

## Key Characters
- **Proboscidea**: The Trunk Bearer, intelligent giant
- **Procavia**: The Rock Hyrax, small but wise
- **Trichechus**: The Gentle Manatee, aquatic wanderer
- **Orycteropus**: The Earth Pig (Aardvark), insect hunter

## Themes
- African isolation fostering unique adaptations
- Intelligence emerging in elephant lineages
- Aquatic transitions from terrestrial ancestors
- Ecological engineering by large mammals
