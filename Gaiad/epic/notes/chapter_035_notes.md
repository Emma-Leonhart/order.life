# Chapter 35 Notes

## Key Characters & Lineages

### Sons of Demos Line
- **Cyath** - "builder fine", created coral cities and reefs beneath the ocean
- **Chondrocles** - leader of carnivorous hunting sponges, uses deadly hooks and traps

### Lobopus and His Descendants  
- **Lobopus** - built a heart "like Dutrus" to strengthen his weak will and citizens
- **Onychodictyon** - son of Lobopus
  - **Tactopus** - explorer, bore twin sons Ferreus and Ferox
  - **Xenu** - dark figure who claimed to be "Emperor of galaxy wide", tried to control minds with weakness stories, defeated by his son Gracilis

### Three Great Houses Founded
1. **Velvetclaw House** (from Gracilis)
2. **Ironfoot House** (from Ferreus) 
3. **Waterbear House** (from Ferox via Ursus)

## Velvetclaw House Genealogy
- **Gracilis** → four sons: Paucipodes, Microdictyon, Xenianus, Therion Velvetclaw
- **Xenianus** → twin daughters: Xenusia and Diania the Cactus (has protective spines)
- **Therion Velvetclaw** → Cardios and Hallucigena 
- **Hallucigena** → four children: Sparsa, Fortis, Hongmen, Annika
- **Hongmen** → Luolishania and Collins Monster
- **Annika** → cast away armor for agility, became ancestor of velvet worms, described as caring matriarch

## Waterbear House
- **Ferox** → downsized for survival → **Ursus** 
- Ursus became ancestor of water bears (tardigrades)
- First to conquer land but couldn't breathe air yet, so went dormant as "Tuns"

## Ironfoot House  
- **Ferreus Ironfoot** → two sons: Gille and another
- **Gille** → built gills above his legs → **Kerygmachelon**
- **Kerygmachelon** → **Pambdelurion**
- **Pambdelurion** → three children: Arthur, Anomalos, Opabinia

### Arthur's Innovation
- Built strong armor and hardened flying gills
- Legs could branch in two: gill became exopod, leg became endopod
- **This created the arthropods** - "today they rule the earth"

### Anomalos Dynasty
- Ruled "the world entire" for ten generations
- Eventually fell from power (death scene with doom prophecy)
- Sons continued ruling after his death

### Opabinia's Line
- Daughters led humble, graceful lives focused on beauty

## Major Themes & Events

### Tommotian Age Beginning
- New era of glory and expansion
- Reef-building civilization established by Cyath's descendants (Archaeocyathids)
- Three great houses emerge with different survival strategies

### Evolutionary Adaptations
- **Reef builders** - Cyath's coral cities provide lasting structures
- **Predatory sponges** - Chondrocles' line uses hooks and traps
- **Armor & joints** - Arthur's arthropod innovation 
- **Size reduction** - Ferox/Ursus strategy for survival
- **Agility over protection** - Annika's velvet worm path

### Power Dynamics
- Xenu's failed attempt at galactic mind control
- Anomalos dynasty's rise and eventual fall
- Competition between the three houses (Velvetclaw, Ironfoot, Waterbear)

## Biological/Historical Connections
- **Archaeocyathids** - early reef-building organisms
- **Carnivorous sponges** - modern deep-sea predatory sponges  
- **Tardigrades** (water bears) - famous for extreme survival, dormancy
- **Onychophorans** (velvet worms) - living fossils with soft bodies
- **Arthropods** - most successful animal phylum by species count
- **Anomalocarids** - dominant Cambrian predators
- **Opabinia** - bizarre 5-eyed Cambrian organism

The chapter establishes the major evolutionary innovations of the Cambrian period through mythological genealogies, with each lineage representing different survival strategies that persist today.
