# Capricorn (2宮) - Days 29-56

*The Saga of the Ocean - From Cambrian to Devonian*

---

In Terra's rivers, flowing free,
Two lineages would come to be
United in a bond so strong
That lasted both their whole life long.

Great Symbio-Mygus, fungal lord,
Son of Mygus by accord,
Tenth generation from the line
Of Zygos, ancient and divine.

Fair Charina-Planta bright,
Daughter of photosynthetic light,
Tenth from Charina's algae clan
That lived where river waters ran.

These two would meet beside the shore
Of Lichen Lake, as none before.
A marriage of such different kinds:
The fungus with the plant combines.

"Come, fair maiden of the green,"
Said Symbio-Mygus, king serene.
"Let us join our different ways
And rule through all our living days."

"I capture light from sunny skies,
You gather nutrients that arise
From earth and stone and decay.
Together we can rule the day."

Charina-Planta heard his call
And agreed to join with all
Her photosynthetic might
To his fungal appetite.

"A fusion we shall create,"
She said, "to meet our fate.
Plant and fungus, side by side,
We'll conquer land both far and wide."

Their marriage was a wondrous sight,
Two kingdoms joining in their might.
An agricultural empire grand
Rose up to claim the fertile land.

When Lichen Lake was full and high,
They thrived beneath the open sky.
But when the waters dried away,
They slept until another day.

Dormant in the drought they lay,
Waiting for the rain's display.
When water came, they rose again
To rule their vast domain.

Together they bore children bright,
The lichens, filled with dual might.
Each one a fusion of their line,
Both fungal strong and plant divine.

Countless forms they took with glee,
Each suited to their destiny.
Fruticose lichens, tall and proud,
Like trees they rose above the crowd.

Reindeer Moss spread far and wide,
Goldeneye Lichen by their side.
Cladonia's cups held morning dew,
While Old Man's Hair in breeches grew.

The great foliose lichens came,
Leafy beauties earning fame.
Ruffle Lichen, soft and fair,
Pillow Lichen everywhere.

Physcia spread his leafy form
To weather every kind of storm.
These leafy beauties caught the light
And made the barren places bright.

The crusty crustose lichens strong
Could survive both short and long
The harshest places, dry and rough,
Where other life was not enough.

Rime Lichen on the mountain height,
Orange Sea Lichen, burning bright.
So tough they were, so strong to last,
They held when other life had passed.

The powdery leprose clan
Spread everywhere that they began.
Breaking apart upon the wind,
New territories they would find.

Leprose Lichen, golden dust,
Scattered with the wind's great thrust.
Golden particles would fly
To colonize both low and high.

Some lichens chose the hardest way,
Living in the rock to stay.
Endolithic forms so small
Made stone their home and all.

Ruby Firedot, burning red,
In solid rock made his bed.
Where nothing else could ever live,
He had his life to give.

The filamentous lichens came
To play a protective game.
They guarded cyanobacteria
From harm in every area.

Ephebe wrapped his threads around
The blue-green life that he had found.
Together they would make their home
Where neither could survive alone.

And strangest of them all to see
Were jelly lichens by the sea.
In gelatinous embrace
They found their living space.

Tar Jelly Lichen, dark and thick,
With cyanobacteria's magic trick.
In jelly they would swim and live,
And mutual aid they'd give.

But Symbio-Mygus, great though he,
Took another bride to see.
Trentophila, daughter fair
Of Trent, with golden hair.

The daughters of Trentophila
Spread far across the area.
They colonized the world around
With partnership they'd found.

Some turned to parasitic ways,
Like Cephaleura in her days.
She envied Amber's daughters bright
And stole their photosynthetic light.

But greatest of all partnerships
Were those that sailed on nature's ships:
The daughters of fair Amber true
And sons of Arbusculus too.

Great Amber wed Arbusculus,
Their union glorious.
They bore both Glomer and Ashley,
A pair both strong and free.

Now Ashley wed with Wort the wise,
And from their love there would arise
The ancestors of plants so green
And mosses, fairest ever seen.

A city they built upon the land,
Both beautiful and grand.
The first to leave the water's hold
And stake their claim so bold.

But Ashley could not stand alone
Upon the land of stone.
She needed help to gather food
From soil that was not good.

So Glomer, brother true and kind,
Connected with his mind
A network underground to share
The nutrients found there.

Like his lichen brothers old,
Glomer's story would be told
Of partnerships that help us thrive
And keep the world alive.

He dug into the earthen ground
Where minerals could be found.
While Ashley farmed in sunny light,
Their trade was mutual delight.

Ashley and Wort bore children countless,
Their progeny were boundless.
But raising young on land so dry
Required help from fungi nigh.

So Glomer built a network vast
That would forever last:
The Wood Wide Web, that ancient net
That serves the forests yet.

An underground economy
Of mutual harmony.
Each plant could trade with every other
Through their fungal brother.

The wood wide web was not a bubble,
Glomer solved their trouble.
He became the first to see
That cooperation sets us free.

His startup grew beyond all measure,
A network of such treasure.
Today he holds the largest share
Of fungal networks everywhere.

With eighty percent market hold,
His story still is told.
WoodNet service, tried and true,
Connects the forest through and through.

But other fungi joined the game,
Each seeking their own fame.
Ectomycorrhizae came
To play the network's game.

Amazon became a part
Of this great networked art.
The Wood Wide Web spreads far and wide
Through every forest side.

By this great union's might
Of Symbio-Mygus' sight
And Charina-Planta's power,
They conquered every hour.

They built their civilization grand
Upon the fertile land.
So great their empire grew to be
That it changed history.

Like daughters of Saya before,
Who'd opened evolution's door,
These lichens and their fungal kin
Made the ice age begin.

And so began the Cryogenian,
That age humanitarian.
The world froze over, white and cold,
As their great story told.

But in their icy reign supreme,
They lived the partnership dream.
That plant and fungus, side by side,
Could in the cold abide.

So honor Symbio-Mygus true
And Charina-Planta too.
Their marriage showed the world the way
That partnerships can stay.

In every lichen that you see
Upon the rock or tree,
Their legacy lives on today
In symbiotic display.

From mountain peak to ocean shore,
Their children evermore
Show us how two different kinds
Can join their hearts and minds.

The Wood Wide Web beneath our feet
Makes forest life complete.
The network that they started long
Ago still sings its song.

In partnership we find our strength,
We'll go to any length
To help each other as we grow
Through all that we may know.

The lichen's lesson, tried and true:
Together, me and you
Can face whatever storm may come
And never be undone.

This is the chronicle of Cnider,
Who sat upon a rock so wide
And built on each side of his throne
A row of mouths, his very own.

With tentacles reaching down below,
A great column all aglow,
He made his city on the stone
Where he would rule all alone.

His fishermen in lines he placed,
A Siphonoglyph, perfectly spaced.
Down each mouth, with skillful art,
Each played their fishing part.

Great Cnider made a sacred pact
With Luna, keeping their contract.
By her blessing, bright and true,
On the full moon he bore two.

Two sons came in her silver light:
Traditional Anthus, shining bright,
And bold Anaxydros the new,
Whose innovations would shine through.

To this day when Luna's face
Shines full upon the watery place,
The sons of Cnider and fair Nettle
Their reproductive matters settle.

By moonlight they bear their young,
As Luna's ancient song is sung.
The tidal pull, the silver beam
Fulfill their reproductive dream.

Now Anthus kept the ancient way,
Following tradition's display.
His children built their homes on stone
And never far from land they'd roam.

But bold Anaxydros chose to change,
His innovations were strange.
From him came children two:
Pompom and Meduson true.

Great Pompom chose the stalked path,
To weather time and nature's wrath.
He built upon the ocean floor
And opened innovation's door.

From Pompom came two sons of might:
Conos and Stauros, burning bright.
The stalked jellyfish they became,
Adding to their ancestor's fame.

But Meduson chose a different way,
He would not on the bottom stay.
A new city he did build
That with wanderlust was filled.

His city floated in the sea,
Drifting wild and drifting free.
The ancestor of jellyfish,
He granted their floating wish.

At first he had no direction,
Just aimless drift without connection.
He picked up what he could find
While floating with the tide.

But soon an idea came to him
As he floated, free to swim:
"Why should I drift where currents go?
I'll pump and swim both high and low!"

He learned to pump his body tight
And shoot through water with delight.
No more would he helpless drift—
His swimming was his gift.

Meanwhile the sons of Anthus grew
Across the oceans, deep and blue.
Among them were the Anemones,
Who swayed like flowered trees.

And Corals built their cities grand
Upon the ocean's shifting sand.
With Zooxanthellae they'd farm
And keep their cities free from harm.

Zoochlorellae, green and bright,
Helped them capture morning light.
These partnerships would make
The reefs for others' sake.

From Meduson came children two:
Bold Diplos and sweet Jelly true.
Each would take a different path
Through ocean's joy and wrath.

Fair Jelly bore two mighty lines
Of jellyfish with grand designs:
The Cubozoans, box-shaped, wise,
Who learned to use their eyes.

And Scyphozoans, "True Jellyfish,"
Who granted many a sailor's wish
To see their beauty in the deep
Where ocean secrets keep.

The sons of Scyphos numbered high,
Beneath the sea and sky.
Each polyp bore a myriad young
Whose praises would be sung.

Pacific Sea Nettle swam
Through waters like a swimming ram.
Their trailing tentacles so long
Made predators think twice.

But Cubos was a father kind,
With caring heart and mind.
He bore but few children dear
And held each one near.

We pray to Cubos when we seek
To be fathers strong, not weak.
His example shows the way
To care for young each day.

The eyes of Cubos, complex, true,
Could see through waters blue.
No simple spots of light were these,
But eyes that truly seize.

Each detail in the liquid space,
Each movement, form, and face.
The box jellyfish today
Still see in Cubos' way.

From Cnider's ancient line
Came forms both crude and fine.
Some stayed upon the rocky shore
While others chose to soar.

The anemones wave their arms
Like flowers with their charms.
But touch them and you'll feel the sting
Of cnidocytes' ring.

The corals build their reefs so grand,
Cities throughout the land
Beneath the waves they rise
Like underwater skies.

Each polyp in its cup
Reaches tentacles up
To catch the food that drifts
Through water's gentle shifts.

The jellyfish that swim so free
Through every part of sea
Show us how to move with grace
Through life's embrace.

Some drift with current's flow,
Others choose where they go.
Each strategy has its place
In ocean's vast space.

The cnidarian way
Lives on in every bay
Where tentacles reach out
Without a doubt.

From Cnider's rocky throne
His children, fully grown,
Spread through the waters wide
With tentacles as guide.

In every sting you feel
From jellyfish so real,
Remember Cnider's art
That gave them their start.

The radial symmetry
Of their biology
Shows patterns clean and true
In everything they do.

So honor great Cnider,
That ancient provider
Who sat upon his stone
And made the sea his own.

His covenant with Luna's light
Still guides them through the night.
When the full moon shines above,
They make their spawn with love.

The cnidarians today
Still follow Cnider's way:
With tentacles they hunt
And do their survival stunt.

From simple to complex,
From polyp to apex,
The jellyfish still roam
Through ocean's salty foam.

When Cambrius and Spriggina died,
Great heroes who had ruled with pride,
Two sons were left to claim their throne:
Bold Protos and Dutrus, each alone.

Each brother saw a different way
To honor what their parents' legacy would say.
The body plan that they had made
Would be interpreted and obeyed.

Great Protos looked upon the form
And said, "I'll keep the ancient norm.
The first hole is the mouth so wide,
The second is where waste will hide."

"The mesoderm is like the past,
Mesoglea that will last.
My mouth shall bear tentacles bright
Like fathers did in ancient sight."

"O heathen, do you not see
The anus brings us victory?
For generations we did bathe
In filth, but now we are saved!"

"We keep our mouths so clean and pure
And eat food nutritious, sure.
The endoderm, ectoderm, three—
The mesoderm—shall ever be!"

"These layers never shall we mix,
For they're civilization's fix.
The foundation, tried and true,
Shall guide us in all that we do."

But bold Dutrus saw it not the same,
He'd make a different claim:
"The second hole's the mouth, I say,
The first hole takes waste away."

"The mesoderm is something more
Than what we've seen before.
Beyond mesoglea it goes,
Where fisherman and shieldmaid grows."

"A reunion, don't you see,
Of ancient unity?
Choanoderm and Archaeocyte
Together in the fight."

"O heathen, can't you understand?
The mouth is progress' hand!
What we take into our core
Shapes what we have in store."

"What we expel is just the past,
But what we eat will last.
By joining old with new again
We'll build a glorious reign."

And so the war began to rage,
Upon history's page.
Whose vision would define the way
For the Cambrian display?

Each brother bore two sons of might
To join the coming fight:
From Dutrus came both brave and true
Dietrich and Saccorhytus too.

From Protos came with valor high
Ectus and Spiralius nigh.
Four grandsons of the ancient line
Would make their fates align.

Strange Saccorhytus had no rear,
No anus did appear.
With no way to expel his waste,
His life would not be graced.

So Dutrus' legacy fell
To Dietrich, who served him well.
The loyal son would carry on
Until his life was done.

The sons of Dutrus, it was known,
Throughout the world had grown
Famous for their heads so wise,
But Dietrich had no eyes.

No head had he to lead the way,
But innovation saved the day.
He built himself a tail so strong
To move his life along.

Through muddy ground he made his path
Avoiding others' wrath.
With two nerve cords to guide his course
He found prosperity's source.

He settled down and built a home,
A colony where he could roam.
His simple plan worked very well
In his ancestral dell.

Great Spiralius kept the faith
And avoided common wraith.
He built his city like a top,
A trochophore that would not stop.

With tentacles both long and wide
He fished from side to side.
No fisherman had been before
As skilled upon the shore.

His wealth grew day by day
In his prosperous way.
The trochophore design proved true
For all that he would do.

But Ectus was a bitter soul,
Resentment was his goal.
The secondborn who felt the slight
Would make his grievance right.

"I'll be the greatest of them all,"
He answered duty's call.
"Among Cambrius' sons I'll shine
And make the victory mine."

His tentacles he changed to teeth,
Ferocious underneath.
He shed his skin to stay young,
While battle songs were sung.

With muscles strong and flexing true
He leaped at all he knew.
His prey would never get away
From Ectus' fierce display.

"O eldest sons, beware!" he cried,
"Take caution in your pride!
The legacy belongs to those
Who defeat all their foes!"

And so he declared a war
That would spread both near and far.
Against Dutrus and Spiralius both
He swore his solemn oath.

The sons of Dutrus, brave and true,
The sons of Spiralius too,
And Ectus with his fearsome might
Prepared for the great fight.

These three great tribes would write
The story of their sight.
Their conflict would define the age
On evolution's stage.

And so began that time of fame
When diversity's flame
Burned bright across the ancient sea:
The Cambrian's legacy.

Bodies burst in forms unknown,
As each tribe made their throne.
Innovations everywhere
Filled the water and the air.

Predator and prey alike
Prepared for war to strike.
Arms races would begin
As each sought to win.

The filter feeders found their place
While hunters gave chase.
Some burrowed deep in mud
While others spilled their blood.

Eyes evolved to see the light,
Shells appeared for the fight.
Claws and spines and armor thick
Made survival's trick.

The explosion had begun
Underneath the ancient sun.
Cambrius' legacy lived on
From dusk until the dawn.

In every creature that we see
Lives this ancient memory:
The choice between the old and new
Shapes all that we do.

Some kept the ancient, simple way
While others chose to stay
Innovative, bold, and bright
In evolution's sight.

The war between the brothers three
Lives on in you and me.
In every choice we make each day
We follow their display.

Innovation or tradition,
Each makes its submission
To the force of life that drives
All that grows and thrives.

So honor brave Cambrius,
Who started all this fuss.
His legacy lives on today
In every living way.

The Cambrian explosion's fire
Burns on with desire
In every form of life we see
Through all eternity.

In the age of patriarchs three,
Dutrus, Ectus, Spiralius free,
Among these lords of ancient might,
Ectus was the fearsome sight.

With mouth agape and teeth so sharp,
He played destruction's harp.
Through enemies he ripped and tore,
Like none had done before.

The sons of Isomeres fair
And sponges everywhere
Fell victim to his raiding spree
Across the ancient sea.

A complex mouth he built with care
To catch prey everywhere.
He molted skin and mouth with time,
In rhythm and in rhyme.

His cilia he cast away
For a more effective way.
Amoebae became his sperm,
A change both strange and firm.

His coelom he stripped down bare,
Removed what wasn't there
For function true and speed.
He kept only what he'd need.

Unnecessary scaffolding
He cast off like a ring.
His organs floated free inside
His pseudocoelom wide.

In burrowing he found his art,
Playing the hunter's part.
Through sediment he'd tear and rend
Until his foes would end.

The first predator was he
Upon the ancient sea.
The sons of Dutrus and Spiralius
Fell to his might so glorious.

In viciousness he bore a horde
Of worms who served their lord.
They conquered earth from shore to shore
And always wanted more.

Through earth great Ectus ripped
While soil from him slipped.
Destruction was his name
And carnage was his game.

From Ectus came two sons of might:
Bold Ishmael, ready to fight,
And clever Isaac, young and wise,
Who sought innovation's prize.

Now Ishmael held fast and true
To all his father knew.
Tradition was his guiding star
Through peace and times of war.

But Isaac chose a different way,
Innovation's display.
He'd build upon his father's art
But with a newer heart.

From Ishmael's faithful line
Came Priapus, strong and fine.
Patriarch of the Priapulids,
Who live where darkness hides.

Deep in the ocean's depths they dwell
In places none can tell.
Like ancient Ediacaran lands
Of hydrogen sulfide strands.

Without oxygen they thrive
And keep their line alive.
In waters dark and deep they stay
Until the judgment day.

Draco, Priapus' brother true,
Became patriarch too.
The mud dragons, horrific, wild,
Each nature's problem child.

Through muds they make their way
Both night and day.
Monsters in the deep they are
Beneath each shining star.

From Isaac came two sons of fame:
Nematus was his name,
And Rhineheart, bold and strong,
Would live his whole life long.

Nematus was quick and spry,
A nomad 'neath the sky.
He bore two sons to carry on:
Nematus II and Gordy's song.

Both sons became prodigal,
Their ways not traditional.
They turned to parasitic life
And caused their father strife.

But in his aging years,
Through sorrows and through tears,
Nematus left that way behind
And peace within him did find.

He became the ancestor great
Of worms throughout their state.
Eighty percent of animals
Are his descendants all.

His city was a sight to see
Of worm community.
From simple to complex they grew
In everything they'd do.

But Gordy chose the parasite way
And never did stray
From living in his brother's flesh,
His host's blood, warm and fresh.

The Gordian worms are his line,
Horrific by design.
They live within their victims' hearts
And tear their lives apart.

From Rhineheart came two more:
Lobopus to explore
And brave Loricus, armored well
With stories he would tell.

Loricus built armor thick
To protect from every trick.
He married Siri, maiden fair,
And lived beyond compare.

His sons live in the depths below
Where mysteries grow.
For half a billion years we thought
Their line to nothing brought.

But in nineteen eighty-three
We found them in the sea.
Alive and well they dwelt
Where pressure could be felt.

The Loricifer's tale
Would never fail.
Living fossils in the deep
Their ancient vigil keep.

These descendants of great Ectus
Show what can protect us:
Some armor, some speed,
Some parasitic greed.

The worms that rule the earth today
In their own way
Remember their ancestor's might
Who brought the predator's sight.

In every garden bed
Where earthworms make their tread,
The legacy lives on
From dusk until the dawn.

In every parasite
That causes fear and fright,
Ectus' spirit lives to tell
His predatory spell.

From mud dragon's lair
To ocean depths so rare,
His children roam the world
With tentacles unfurled.

The age of three patriarchs
Left its lasting marks
On all the world we see
Through all eternity.

But Ectus, most of all,
Heeded evolution's call
To be the hunter fierce and true
In all that he would do.

His legacy of tooth and claw
Became nature's law:
That predator and prey must dance
In life's great circumstance.

So honor fierce Ectus,
Who was so ravenous.
His hunger drove the change
Through evolution's range.

Without his predator's art
Life could not start
The arms race that would lead
To every living creed.

In every creature's fight
To live another night,
Ectus' spirit burns bright
Through all its might.

Among the three great ancestors,
Those ancient processors,
Spiralius was most conservative,
His ways preservative.

He fished with tentacles long,
As fathers had done strong.
The ancient art he kept alive
To help his children thrive.

Great Spiralius worked each day
In his diligent way
To provide for children all
Who answered duty's call.

Among his many sons of fame
Two earned eternal name:
Bold Kimberella the king
And Gnathifer's ring.

Kimberella earned his fame
Through his eternal name.
His tomb is visited today
By pilgrims on their way.

The greatest king was he
Of his time's dynasty.
His kingdom moved with might
Across the steppe so bright.

A billion years of fame
Belongs to his great name.
On Australian stamps today
His image holds its sway.

But Gnathifer chose a different path,
To show his righteous wrath.
A kingdom small but quick
He built with cunning trick.

Like Ectus he could see
The need for weaponry.
A great jaw he built with care
From chitin strong and fair.

A sugar jaw so sweet
For sugar treats to eat,
But though his jaw was sugar-made,
His heart was not so stayed.

With ferocious jaws so bright
He brought the fearsome sight
To sons of Isomeres
Throughout their territories.

In old age from his loins
Came two, like ancient coins:
Bold Gnathos, fierce and wild,
And Hydrover, gentler child.

Gnathos was vicious
More than malicious.
His sons are known today
As Jaw Worms in their way.

But Xenognath was different,
Though still belligerent.
He grew jaws within jaws,
Against all natural laws.

Fifteen jaws in all he made,
A fearsome masquerade.
Each jaw within the last
Held prey both firm and fast.

From Xenognath came two sons:
Bold Marinus, who runs
The seas with might and main,
And Limnos of the rain.

Marinus fought and fought
For all that could be caught.
Dominion of the sea
Was his priority.

But Limnos was cast out
From the ocean's route.
Into the rivers sent,
His kingdom there was bent.

The sons of Marinus mock
Their freshwater flock:
"Small jawed ones," they call
Their cousins one and all.

From Marinus came two more:
Rotiferus to explore
And brave Amisquius,
Bold and glorious.

Rotiferus looked around
And peaceful living found
Among Kimberella's line,
Their ways both good and fine.

He turned to fishing once again,
Like his ancient kin.
His sons became the nomads true,
The Rotifers we view.

In all waters they roam,
Making everywhere home.
Great fishermen are they
From night until the day.

He built his coelom loose
Like Ectus let loose.
This gave him speed and grace
In every watery place.

In rotifer villages
They practice their privileges.
Fishing with their wheels
For all their daily meals.

But among his sons there was
One who broke the laws.
Acanthus the red, so base,
A parasite's disgrace.

He lives in others' guts
And steals like greedy nuts
The food that should belong
To those both right and strong.

Such thievery brings shame
To Rotiferus' name.
A black sheep in the fold
Whose story should be told.

But from Amisquius came
A line of greater fame.
Each generation grew
Jaws bigger through and through.

In Nimrod Bristletongue's time
Their power reached its prime.
They ruled the seas with might,
A fearsome, awesome sight.

More numerous than all
Who answered ocean's call,
The Arrow Worms became
The hunters' greatest name.

The greatest hunters ever seen
Beneath the ocean green.
Their jaws could catch and hold
The bravest and the bold.

Through waters dark and deep
Their vigil they do keep.
No prey can swim away
From their hunting display.

The conservative path
Sometimes shows its wrath
In children who rebel
And stories they do tell.

Spiralius kept the old ways true
But his children grew
In many different directions,
Making their selections.

Some stayed with fishing pure,
Their methods tried and sure.
Others chose the warrior's way
To fight another day.

From tentacles to jaws,
Following nature's laws,
Each lineage found its place
In evolution's race.

The rotifer's gentle art
Of fishing warms the heart.
While arrow worms show might
In predatory sight.

Both trace their lineage back
To Spiralius' track.
The conservative way
Led to diverse display.

In every freshwater pond
Where rotifers respond
To plankton floating by
Beneath the morning sky,

Remember their ancestor
Who was fishing's protector.
Spiralius kept the art
That gave them their start.

In every arrow worm
That makes the sea fish squirm,
His heritage lives on
From dusk until the dawn.

The three great patriarchs
Left their lasting marks
On all life in the sea
Through all eternity.

But Spiralius shows us well
That traditions tell
Important truths that last
Through future and past.

Innovation has its place
In evolution's race,
But keeping what works true
Is wisdom through and through.

---

While sons of Proteus divided fast
And their kingdoms grew vast,
The sons of Dutrus moved slow
And let their wisdom grow.

Two twin sons were born
In the early morn:
Saccorhytus the lame
And Dietrich of fame.

Poor Saccorhytus never grew
Into something new.
As larva he remained
And was never gained.

His sons were sparse and weak,
With little they could seek.
Their father's childish way
Led them all astray.

But Dietrich was different,
Though at first resistant.
In youth he looked the same
As his brother's frame.

But as the years passed by
He reached toward the sky.
Maturity he found
And wisdom did resound.

Gill slits he built with care
To filter everywhere
The ground beneath his feet
For food that he could eat.

A great tail he made
That would never fade,
Extending past his rear
To swim both far and near.

A heart he built within
To let the blood begin
Its journey through his frame
To nourish in his name.

Two great nerve cords he laid,
One dorsal, one ventral made,
To coordinate his might
Both day and night.

Until he grew both great and strong,
His body large and long.
The anatomy he made
Would never ever fade.

The sons of Dietrich spread
Wherever they were led
Across the world so wide
With fortune as their guide.

Great fortune blessed their way
Throughout each passing day.
This time was called by all
The Fortunian's call.

First born were the twins
Where the story begins:
Bold Ambulus the free
And Chordatus of the sea.

These brothers both worked well
With all they had to tell.
With sons of Proteus
They ruled victorious.

They vassalized the land
Of Ediacar's grand
Empire that had been
Since time was first seen.

Now Ambulus settled down
Upon a rocky crown.
He built his simple home
Where he could freely roam.

But Chordatus chose the way
Of order's display.
He centralized his rule
Like a wise school.

One spinal cord he made
Along his back, arrayed
To coordinate his will
With consummate skill.

But Chordatus needed more
Support than heretofore.
A notochord he built
Without any guilt.

And so was born that day
The spinal cord's array.
Chordatus became the sire
Of all whom we admire:

The chordates and the spine
That makes our form divine.
From his great innovation
Came our very creation.

From his spinal cord so true
Our brainstem also grew.
The foundation he laid down
Became our neural crown.

But Ambulus' sons chose
A different path than those
Who followed central rule—
They kept the older school.

Local leaders they obeyed,
And to shamans they prayed.
No great lords they needed,
Their freedom they heeded.

The sons of Ambulus became
The acorn worms of fame,
And echinoderms so bright
With stars shining light.

The sons of Dutrus saw
The end of ancient law.
Ediacaran Empire fell
As they could tell.

And so truly began
The Cambrian plan.
A new age had dawned
As the old world was spawned.

Bluebelle the Sea Squirt
In waters did assert
Her right to filter feed
And fulfill her need.

Snowfloof the Vertebrate
With spine both strong and straight
Swam through the ocean blue
With backbone tried and true.

Starfy the Echinoderm
Kept to the ancient form
Of radial symmetry
For all eternity.

Among the sons of Nephrus
The sons of Dutrus
Were the late bloomers true
But their art they knew.

They took their time to learn
And perfect each turn.
But once they found their way
Nothing could make them stray.

From sons of Chordatus came
Vertebrates of fame
And Sea Squirts who filter
Without any filter.

From sons of Ambulus rose
Echinoderms in rows:
The Starfish and Urchins
In their ocean churches.

In the last days they cried
"Ediacaro must die!"
And left behind their mark
Both light and dark.

Treptichnal burrows deep
Where their memories sleep,
And oxygenized soil
From their endless toil.

A son of Ectus made
His burrow in the shade,
A twisting, turning home
Through earth and sandy loam.

And so Ediacaro fell
As time would tell.
The mats of Saya old
And Desulfa's hold

Were destroyed at last
When the new age passed
Over the ancient ways
Of pre-Cambrian days.

The Fortunian time had come
When all would succumb
To the new order's might
Both day and night.

From Dietrich's patient art
Came each chordate part.
The backbone and the brain
Would always remain.

His legacy lives on
From dusk until dawn
In every spine that's straight
And every vertebrate.

The twins who chose their way—
Ambulus and Chordatus' day—
Show us how to grow:
Some fast, some slow.

But both paths have their place
In evolution's race.
Whether central or free,
Both have their destiny.

So honor brave Dietrich
Who made us all so rich
With spine and cord and heart
That gave us our start.

The Fortunian's gift
Gave evolution's shift
From simple to complex
Through all its effects.

In every breath we take,
In every move we make,
Dietrich's innovation
Guides our creation.

---

As sons of Cambrius grew in might
Across the world both day and night,
All sons of Bios felt the change
Throughout their ancient range.

The sons of Cubos and Scyphos rose
To challenge all their foes.
Their guerrilla war began
That day when time began.

In ambush still they wait today
To hunt their living prey.
Their ancient raid shall never cease
Until they find their peace.

Among great Demos' sponge-born line
Came Cyath, builder fine.
Great cities he built 'cross the seas—
The reefs beneath the breeze.

These coral cities rise on high
Beneath the ocean sky.
Through countless rulers they endure
With structures strong and pure.

The Archaeocyathid race
Built reefs in every place.
Their legacy lives on today
In reefs where fishes play.

Among the sons of Demos came
The hunters fierce of name:
Great Chondrocles' hunting band
Spread wide across the land.

Carnivorous sponges they became,
With predatory fame.
They trap the sons of Cambrius
With methods dangerous.

Their hooks reach out with deadly art
To pierce the victim's heart.
Their shieldmaidens come for the kill
To satisfy their will.

Among Spiralius' noble line
The sons of Brachios shine.
In new reefs they made their home
Where prosperous they'd roam.

As fishermen they found their way
To fortune every day.
The reefs became their fishing ground
Where plenty could be found.

And so began Tommotian days
Of glory and of praise.
A new era had begun
Beneath the shining sun.

Here now we tell the tale
Of Lobopus without fail.
His vision he imposed with might
On all the world's delight.

Great Lobopus saw his will was weak,
His citizens made meek.
A heart like Dutrus he built true
To nourish all he knew.

From Lobopus came forth
Onychodictyon of worth.
This son would bear two more:
Tactopus to explore
And Xenu, dark and fell,
With stories he would tell.

Tactopus bore twin sons of might:
Ferreus burning bright
And Ferox, strong and bold,
With stories to be told.

But Xenu sought to rule the stars
And heal all psychic scars.
Emperor of galaxy wide
He claimed with foolish pride.

Into our minds he tried to write
Stories of weakness' sight.
But Gracilis, his noble son,
Put end to what he'd done.

And so three houses came to birth:
Velvetclaw upon the earth,
Ironfoot with strength so true,
And Waterbear's line too.

Here now Velvetclaw's tale we tell
Of how they rose so well.
From Gracilis came four sons strong:
Paucipodes all along,
Microdictyon brave and true,
Xenianus through and through,
And Therion Velvetclaw
Who followed nature's law.

Xenianus bore twin maids:
Xenusia in the glades
And Diania the Cactus bright
With spines to win the fight.

Therion Velvetclaw begot
Cardios, who fought
And Hallucigena strange
Throughout his living range.

From Hallucigena came
Four children of great fame:
Sparsa quick and light,
Fortis strong in fight,
Hongmen wise and old,
And Annika, brave and bold.

Hongmen bore two sons so grand:
Luolishania in the land
And Collins Monster, fierce and wild,
Nature's problem child.

But Annika chose a different way,
She cast her armor away.
For agility she traded
Her protection heavy-shaded.

She became the ancestor true
Of velvet worms so blue.
A caring matriarch is she
Who guides them lovingly.

In Ursus' line things went
Down a different bent.
Ferox wanted to survive
Whatever came alive.

He downsized small and tough,
Invulnerable stuff.
From him came Ursus strong,
Who lived both short and long.

Ursus became the sire
Of water bears' entire
Line who first conquered land
With their small, mighty band.

Unable yet to breathe
On land's protecting sheath,
As Tuns they go dormant true
Until the danger's through.

In Ironfoot's great line
Greatness would shine.
Ferreus Ironfoot bore
Two sons to explore:

Gille built gills with care
Above his legs so fair.
His son Kerygmachelon
Swam with gills upon.

Kerygmachelon the great
Had a noble fate.
He bore son Pambdelurion,
Mighty champion.

Pambdelurion bore three
Children of destiny:
Arthur strong and true,
Anomalos who grew
To rule with iron hand,
And fair throughout the land,
Opabinia the bright,
Beautiful to sight.

Arthur built armor strong
To last his whole life long.
His flying gills he hardened tight
And fused them for the fight.

His legs could branch in two:
The gill as exopod grew,
The leg as endopod stayed—
Thus arthropods were made.

The sons of Anomalos ruled
As none before had schooled.
The world entire was theirs
Through all their proud affairs.

For generations ten they reigned
While others were constrained.
From realm of Ghedos dark
He watched his royal mark.

But on his deathbed bed
These words of doom were said:
"Thy pomp brought down to grave,
No power left to save.

How art thou fallen down,
O Anomalos from thy crown!
From heaven thou art cast,
Thy glory could not last."

Yet single death could not end
The suffering they send.
His sons would rule with might
Through day and through the night.

But fair Opabinia's daughters all
Answered beauty's call.
Humble lives they led
With grace and gentle tread.

And Arthur Ironfoot's line
Would grow beyond design.
Through hardship they endured
With blood and sweat assured.

The Arthropods they became
With million-species fame.
Today they rule the earth
Since their ancient birth.

From Lobopus came the tide
That spread both far and wide.
Three houses born that day
Would rule in their own way.

Velvetclaw with agile grace,
Waterbear's enduring race,
Ironfoot with strength so true—
All from one ancestor grew.

The Tommotian age began
With more than mortal plan.
The reefs rose from the sea
For all eternity.

In every coral home
Where fishes freely roam,
Remember Cyath's art
That gave the reefs their start.

In every velvet worm
That makes the earth worm squirm,
Annika's caring way
Lives on another day.

In every water bear
That conquers everywhere,
Ursus' strength endures
Through all that time assures.

In every arthropod
That walks upon the sod,
Arthur's innovation
Shaped our creation.

The sons of Cambrius changed
How all life was arranged.
Their multiplication
Changed all of creation.

But from these changes came
Lines of lasting fame:
The builders of the reef,
The hunters beyond belief.

The three great houses rose
To challenge all their foes.
Through innovation true
They made the world anew.

---

This is the chronicle we tell
Of Arthur Ironfoot so well.
His sons would spread both far and wide
With evolution as their guide.

Arthur bore two sons of fame:
Arthropus, double-legged by name,
And Fuxi, wise and strong,
Who lived his whole life long.

Arthropus the double-legged
From him great lines were pledged.
Two sons he bore with might:
Ferron and Isoxys bright.

From Ferron came two more:
Megacheiron to explore
And Euthyphro the wise
Who looked with knowing eyes.

Megacheiron bore sons many,
Among them Pantopus—any
Day he hoped to find
A mate both true and kind.

Pantopus was lonely there
Until he met a maiden fair.
Beautiful Pyka was her name,
Who set his heart aflame.

"You are all legs!" he cried
To his beloved bride.
And so they became the line
Of Sea Spiders so fine.

The Sea Spiders built cities strange
Throughout their ocean range.
In their legs they stored
All organs they adored:

Intestines in their limbs,
Genitals where water swims,
Gills within each leg—
No coelom did they beg.

All legs they truly were
As Pantopus did aver.
Their bodies lean and slight,
Their legs their main delight.

Euthyphro bore two sons:
Insectus, when day begun,
And Arachnus the keen
With appendages seen.

From Insectus' noble line
The insects would shine.
From Arachnus would come
Arachnids, every one.

The sons of Arachnus bore
Great appendages to explore.
The sons of Insectus made
Great legs for their trade.

Some lived in waters blue,
Some on land walked through.
Aquatic and terrestrial,
Both paths proved beneficial.

Insectus bore three sons strong:
Mandibulus all along,
Aquilonifer so free,
And Hymenocarina of the sea.

Mandibulus bore two more:
Crustaceus to explore
The waters deep and wide,
And Euthy by his side.

From Crustaceus came the race
Of Crustaceans in every place.
The lobsters and the crabs
With claws for holding grabs.

But Euthy chose the shore
Where waves would crash and roar.
Upon the rocks so high
Beneath the open sky.

With water bears he walked
Where dry and wet air talked.
The asphyxiating land
They faced with courage grand.

Here they laid their eggs
Between the stone ledges.
In gardens of lichen green
Their young would first be seen.

From Euthy's brave descendants
Who faced the land's defendants,
The insects would arise
To conquer earth and skies.

Arachnus bore two sons:
Trilos when day begun
And Serk of ancient fame
Who earned eternal name.

Serk bore many children,
Among them Chelicer, hidden
In shadows dark and deep,
And Sidney, secrets to keep.

From Chelicer's small line
The spiders would shine.
All arachnids eight-legged
From his bloodline were pledged.

Today in every corner
Where webs are a mourner
For flies caught in their snare,
Chelicer's children are there.

Among great Trilos' daughters
Who ruled the ancient waters
Were Trilobon the queen,
Marrella, ghostly seen,
Esmeralda jewel-bright,
And Retifacia's sight.

Marrella soft and pale
Told a ghostly tale.
She became ancestress
Of Marellans no less.

Like phantoms in the sea
They lived quite freely.
Soft-bodied and ethereal,
Almost immaterial.

Trilobon bore four children
In waters never still then:
Trilobeth the great queen,
Xander, strong and keen,
Necta sweet and fair,
And Helmut everywhere.

Trilobeth became the mother
Of Trilobites—no other
Rulers of the sea
Could match their dynasty.

Through their great conquest
They brought at their behest
The Yakutian era's dawn
When old ways were withdrawn.

Great Trilobeth bore two sons:
Redlich when day begun
And Agnos, wise and old,
With stories to be told.

From Redlich came the line
Of houses most divine:
Corynex built his house
With wisdom to espouse.

From Corynex came Lichida
Who built his great armada.
His house grew strong and wide
With fortune as their guide.

From Lichida came Odontos,
Builder of great crontos.
His spiny house arose
To challenge all his foes.

From Ptychos, Redlich's brother,
Came four sons like no other:
Proetes strong and true,
Asaphus of waters blue,
Harpeth of the deeps,
And Phacos, who never sleeps.

Each founded their own line
With characteristics fine.
The Trilobites spread wide
Across the ocean's tide.

For millions of years they reigned
While other life was chained.
The rulers of the sea
Through all their dynasty.

Their compound eyes could see
Through all eternity.
No detail could escape
Their vision's perfect shape.

Segmented bodies bore
Legs numbering by the score.
Each segment had its pair
To walk through water fair.

They molted as they grew
Like arthropods still do.
Each stage brought greater size
Beneath the ocean skies.

The Yakutian time had come
When Trilobites were sum
Of all success could be
In their vast dynasty.

From Arthur's innovation
Came this radiation:
Insects, spiders, crabs,
Each with different grabs.

The Sea Spiders so strange
Extended their full range
With organs in each limb—
A body plan quite slim.

The Crustaceans in the sea
Built their dynasty.
The insects on the land
Spread with courage grand.

The arachnids eight-legged
From Chelicer were pledged.
In shadows they would dwell
With stories they could tell.

But none could match the fame
Of Trilobites by name.
For eons they held sway
Until their final day.

From Pantopus and Pyka's love
To rulers high above,
Arthur's legacy spread
Long after he was dead.

In every arthropod
That walks upon the sod,
His biramous limb design
Lives on through space and time.

The double-legged innovation
Sparked this radiation
That filled both sea and land
With creatures truly grand.

In every spider's web
That catches life's ebb,
In every insect's flight
Through day and through the night,

In every lobster's claw
That follows nature's law,
In every crab that walks
Where ocean beauty talks,

Remember Arthur's art
That gave them all their start.
The Ironfoot legacy
Lives through eternity.

The sons of Arthur proved
How innovation moved
The world from simple forms
To complexity that warms

The heart of those who see
This vast diversity.
From one ancestral line
Came forms both crude and fine.

The Yakutian age begun
When Trilobites had won
Their place as rulers true
Of waters deep and blue.

But time would show again
That even greatest men
And creatures in their prime
Must yield to passing time.

Yet Arthur's gift lives on
From dusk until the dawn
In every jointed leg
That walks where life does beg

For forms both strong and true
To see the journey through.
The arthropods remain
Through sunshine and through rain.

---

Among the sons of Cambrius
Two faced issues serious:
Chordatus, son of Dutrus true,
And Annelidus, strong through and through.

Each one supported by
Hydrostatic pressure high.
With water pressure in their frame
They bore their body's name.

Together they perceived the flaw:
When movement broke the law
Of circulation through their form,
Their blood could not stay warm.

To nourish organs through their length
They needed greater strength.
So hearts they built with arteries
And veins like flowing seas.

Together each one made with care
Closed systems everywhere.
The blood would flow in circuits true
And nourish organs through.

Our great bloodlines were born that day
When hearts showed them the way.
From hydrostatic to circulatory,
Evolution's greatest story.

From Annelon came two sons:
Segmentus when day begun
And Ribbon, hunter of the deep
Whose prey would never sleep.

Ribbon built a proboscis long
And venomous and strong.
From this weapon he would hunt
His prey with skillful stunt.

His sons are known today
As Ribbon Worms who slay
Their victims with their poison dart
Shot straight into the heart.

Segmentus built his body wise
With segments that would rise
In number past all count—
Each segment paramount.

He built resilience strong
Throughout his body long.
With countless legs and bristles too
His segments carried through

Their industries with care
And spread them everywhere.
Each segment bore its pair
Of legs beyond compare.

Segmentus bore two sons:
Pleistos when day begun
And Amphon of the sea
Who lived quite happily.

Amphon bore a son and daughter:
Amphinos of the water
And Sipuncula the great
Who chose a different fate.

Amphinos became the sire
Of worms that burn like fire.
Fierce beasts with spikes of poison bright
In colors burning bright.

We never tread upon their ground
Where they can be found.
Their beauty hides their deadly art—
They'll pierce the beating heart.

Modern flags today still show
The colors that bestow
Great honor to Amphinos' line
With patterns so divine.

Sipuncula chose to be
So different and free
That her own phylum she became—
The peanut worms of fame.

Pleistos bore two sons:
Vermo when day begun
And Errantius who roamed
Far from his ancient home.

Errantius bore two more:
Myzo the parasite, and for
Balance, Greatswimmer true
Who swam the ocean blue.

Greatswimmer bore a son and daughter:
Phyllos swift of water
And Eunice, jealous, wild,
Never meek or mild.

Eunice the vicious was
Jealous without cause.
She stole her husband's manhood true
And made herself anew.

Without him she conceived
And daughters she received.
These daughters fierce and bold
Are Bobbit Worms of old.

Phyllos bore sons many
More diverse than any:
Swimmers of artistry
Across the boundless sea.

Syllides the lazy one
Never courted, never won
A mate through his own art—
He'd bud off body part

Each month to chase the maids
While he in comfort stayed.
His lazy ways persist
In every tryst.

Tomopteris breaks his fins
As chaff when race begins.
He swims and never lands
On ocean's shifting sands.

Alciops the hawkeyed hunter
Whose sight is like no other.
His eyes surpass them all
Who hear the ocean's call.

And fair Aphrodite
Ancestress of the sea mice free.
Her daughters beautiful
Make the ocean wonderful.

Vermo bore four daughters fair:
Eartha who walked everywhere,
Sapion wise and true,
Hestia of the deep blue,
And Orbinida of fame
Who earned eternal name.

Eartha walked great distances wide
Across the earth with pride.
Her journeys never ceased
From west unto the east.

Sapion bore two daughters more:
Sabella, who would soar
With feathers bright and fair,
And Spiona everywhere
With tentacles that sway
Throughout the night and day.

Sabella's daughters live
As fishermen who give
Us beauty in the temple halls—
The feather dusters' calls

Remind us worms can be
Both beautiful and free.
In every sacred place
They show us nature's grace.

Hestia swam down deep
To Gaia's womb to keep
Her vigil in the dark
Like ancient patriarch.

She closed her gut with care
And bacteria everywhere
Would help her live below
Where others could not go.

Her daughters farm the depths
Where Gaia's treasure kept:
Riftia in volcanic vents
Where fiery mountain scents

Fill the water hot,
And Lamella's got
Her home in cold seeps where
Oil riches fill the lair.

Eartha bore a son and daughter:
Terraclithia of the water
And Echiuron so great
With creativity innate.

Like Sipuncula before,
Echiuron's art and lore
Was so unique and fine
We thought her line divine

Enough to be its own
Phylum, standing alone.
Her creativity
Gave her divinity.

Terraclithia bore two more:
Terebella to explore
And Clitella, wise and small
But mother of them all.

Terebella bore three sons:
Spaghettes when day begun,
Pompeii of the fire,
And Acros to aspire.

Spaghettes used tentacles long
Like ropes both thick and strong
To snare his prey from far—
Miles distant like a star.

Pompeii chose to dwell
In volcanic hell.
Among the fires hot
He made his living spot.

Acros became the sire
Of forms that never tire:
Squidworm and Swima too
Swam the ocean blue.

Clitella was small of head
But wisdom in her spread
Through other organs wise—
Her offspring multiplied

Beyond all counting true.
What bristles never knew
She made up with her spawn:
Children from dusk to dawn.

Her children took to rivers
Where water always quivers.
Today we know them well:
Earthworms who till and tell

The soil of its needs,
And Leeches who feed
On blood from those they meet—
Both bitter and sweet.

From hydrostatic pressure
To circulatory measure,
The worms found their way
To rule both night and day.

In every garden bed
Where earthworms make their tread,
Remember Annelon's line
That made the system fine.

In every ribbon worm
That makes its victims squirm,
In every feather duster's grace
That beautifies the place,

In every fire worm bright
With colors burning light,
In every deep-sea farmer
Working like a charmer,

The legacy lives on
From dusk until dawn
Of hearts and circulation
That saved each population.

The sons of Cambrius learned
That when their bodies turned
And moved through space and time,
Their blood must flow in rhyme

With needs of every part
From tail unto the heart.
The closed system they made
Will never ever fade.

In every beating heart
That plays its vital part,
Remember those who built
The system without guilt

That pumps our blood each day
In its circulatory way.
From Chordatus and Annelidus true
Came the gift to me and you.

---

As sons of Chordatus grew
Their bloodlines strong and true,
And Annelon's children spread
Their segments widespread,

The sons of Ambulus sought
The greatness they had fought
To achieve through patient art
And wisdom of the heart.

While sons of Chordatus learned
To swim as hearts burned,
The sons of Ambulus found
Their way was to be bound

As one with nature's way,
Fishing night and day.
They started much the same
As Chordatus' noble name.

But Hemichus, Ambulus' son,
Built his proboscis one
Day long to serve his need.
Half-cord would be his creed.

His cord was only half,
His brain on nature's behalf
Was also halfway made—
Thus Hemichordates stayed.

Hemichus bore two sons:
Acorn when day begun
And Oak, his brother strong,
Who lived his whole life long.

Acorn lived as worm
Through ocean's every term.
But Oak lived as a tree
Rooted eternally.

Oak bore two sons in time:
Biscarpon, strong and prime,
And Pterobronk his twin,
With different discipline.

Pterobronk became the sire
Of forms that would aspire
To heights in ocean blue:
Graptolites he grew,

And Pterobranches too,
Colonial and true.
Like trees beneath the sea
They lived quite happily.

Biscarpon built with care
A skeleton to wear
Of limestone white and bright
To armor him for fight.

Biscarpon bore two more:
Ctenocyston to explore
The seafloor dark and deep,
And Cincton, who would keep

His gill slits pumping well
Through his armored shell.
Water flowed through his frame
To catch fish in his name.

While Ctenocyston crawled
Where ocean's floor enthralled,
Cincton pumped and fished
For everything he wished.

Protected by his mail
His fishing would not fail.
Through gill slits water flowed
Where tiny fishes showed.

Cincton begat Soluton,
A strange and bold one.
One arm he extended out
With tubes that had no doubt

Inflatable and long
To make his fishing strong.
His left side took control
While right side paid the toll.

His right side shriveled small
While left ruled over all.
Asymmetry was born
That bright and fateful morn.

Soluton begat
Helicoplacus, begat
With arms that multiplied
By three on every side.

No bilateral form
Could weather this storm
Of change that swept his line—
Triradial design

He took upon his frame,
A form without a name
That none had seen before
In all primeval lore.

Helicoplacus took the shape
That let his line escape
The ancient symmetry
For new geometry.

Helicoplacus wed
Fair Adria-Esther, led
By love both true and strong
To sing their mating song.

Together they built low
A city's five-fold glow
Upon the rocks below
Where ocean currents flow.

Pentus was their son
When their work was done.
Five-sided was his way,
His form from that day.

The sons of Pentus grew
Both numerous and true.
Great numbers they became
With pentamerous fame.

Pentus begat Stromatos,
Who built like great kratos
His strength in five-fold form
Through every ocean storm.

Stromatos begat Lepidos,
Who like Soluton chose
To extend his arms once more
Along the ocean floor.

Ambulacra arms he made
In water's bright parade.
These arms would pump and flow
With life from head to toe.

Lepidos begat Felbabka,
Who built his strange cabka
Of plates arranged with care
In patterns everywhere.

Felbabka begat Echidna,
The stalked one, quite a
Sight with spiny skin
That glowed from deep within.

Echidna was the mother
Of children like no other:
The great Echinoderms
Who live through all terms.

Her daughters were sea lilies
That bloomed like water lilies
And dominated seas
With graceful artistry.

Invulnerable to attack
Their cities bore no lack
Of beauty or of might—
A wondrous, flowery sight.

Floating cities they built
Without any guilt
Upon the ocean floor
Like gardens evermore.

Their great cities were
The greatest ever there
In all the ancient time
When ocean was in prime.

Today we see only
Ruins sad and lonely
Of their once mighty home
Beneath the ocean foam.

But in times past they ruled
As none before had schooled
The art of living well
In ocean's deepest dell.

From half-cord Hemichus
To great Echidna thus
The line of Ambulus
Grew glorious.

The hemichordates showed
How nature's garden flowed
From simple worm-like start
To complex living art.

The graptolites and more
Pterobranches explore
Colonial living true
In waters deep and blue.

The early echinoderms
Found through all their terms
That symmetry could change
Through evolution's range.

From bilateral design
To triradial line
To five-fold form complete—
No other has this feat.

The son of Ambulus
Found glory glorious
Not through swimming fast
But through forms that last.

Their calcium carbonate
Made them fortunate
With armor strong and true
That would see them through

The trials of the sea
Through all eternity.
Their spiny skin would show
How beauty's gardens grow.

In every starfish arm
That moves without alarm,
In every sea urchin's spine
That shows pentamerous design,

In every sea lily's grace
That held the ancient place
Of ruler of the deep
Where ocean's secrets keep,

Remember Ambulus' line
And how their design
Became the five-fold way
That lasts until today.

The sons of Ambulus
Were not so glorious
In swimming strength and speed
As Chordatus' noble creed.

But in their patient art
Of living part by part
With nature's gentle way
They found their destined day.

Their fishing was their gift,
Through ocean's every drift
They learned to be at one
From dusk until the sun.

And so from humble start
They mastered nature's art
Of living in the sea
In perfect harmony.

From Hemichus the half
To Echidna's behalf
Of all echinoderm kind,
The line of thoughtful mind

Found its way to shine
In pentamerous design.
Five-fold symmetry
Through all eternity.

The ancient cities fell
But still their stories tell
Of how the patient way
Can win the final day.

In gardens of the sea
They lived most gracefully.
Their floating cities bright
Were truly wondrous sight.

Though now in ruins lie
Their glory will not die.
The five-fold legacy
Lives through eternity.

---

Fire rained down from sky
And many had to die.
The first extinction came
With death's devouring flame.

For years in heaven's height
Hengweh and Mithra fight.
They wrestled in the air
And blocked sun's light so fair.

The Archaeocyathids fell,
Their cities rang death's knell.
The Trilobites and more—
Brachiopods by the score—

And Hyoliths barely
Survived that calamity.
The Botomian time had passed,
Its glory could not last.

Then Mithra spoke these words
To one who serves:
"Wiwaxius, I choose thee
To set the world life free.

Restore what has been lost
And count extinction's cost.
Protect us from the doom
That fills up every room."

Wiwaxius begat two sons:
Molluscus when day begun
And Kamptos, poor and weak,
Who had no strength to seek

Great things or mighty deeds.
He built what barely feeds
A small and brainless state—
A kingdom with no fate.

But Molluscus bore many
Sons, more than any
Other patriarch could claim.
Eldest was Testar's name.

Testar the sixteen-plated
Built shell sophisticated.
A great thick shell he made
Of valves in organized parade.

Sixteen valves in all:
Eight large and eight small.
Eight upon the right
And eight upon the left so bright.

His brothers had no care
For building anywhere.
Bad work ethics they possessed,
Never did their best.

Solenos just drank the blood
Of sons through ocean's flood:
Ctenofer and Cnider's line
Became his bloody wine.

And Caudos ate his fill
Of Foramer at will.
He cared not for the art
Of building any part.

But Testar bore two sons:
Chiton when day begun
And Conchifer Verticus,
Both builders glorious.

Chiton Horizontus
Unified like kratos
His shells in horizontal row:
Eight shells in neat tableau.

He became the ancestor
Of chitons, protector
With eight shells side by side
Along his lengthy hide.

The sons of Chiton roll
When threatened from their goal.
But they aren't very wise—
They gave up brain's prize

Long ago in time past,
Their simple ways held fast.
Intelligence they traded
For armor that's not faded.

Conchifer Verticus
Made his way glorious
By unifying vertical
His shells so beautiful.

A shell upon his left,
A shell upon his right—
His vertical bereft
Of horizontal sight.

Conchifer bore two more:
Bivos to explore
The hinged shell's way,
And Monos every day.

Bivos kept his hinged design
While Monos made combine
His shells into just one—
Two paths when day begun.

Bivos laid in sand
Throughout the fertile land
And fished food from the sea
Most gracefully.

When threatened he would close
His shells against his foes.
Together they would shut
Like door without a cut.

His children came to lay
Upon their sides each day.
Soon they looked the same
As Brachios' great name.

They became Bivalves true:
Clams and mussels too,
Oysters in their beds
With protective heads.

The sons of Monos first
Found little luck, dispersed
Without much success.
But time would bless

Their patient, single shell.
Monoplacophores dwell
With nothing but one plate
As their identifying trait.

But Carlos the curly one,
Grandson when day begun,
Had ideas quite different
From others' management.

He walked across the seas
Exploring as he'd please,
Discovering countless things
That wonder always brings.

He bore two sons of fame:
Gastropus was the name
Of one, and Digitos
The other, strong and close.

Gastropus twisted round
Into spiral profound.
His shell developed might
Through this spiraling sight.

He became ancestor
Of snails, protector
With shells that coil and turn
In patterns we discern.

Each generation more
Would curl than those before
And grow in strength each day
Through their spiraling way.

Today his distant sons
Still coil when day begun.
From garden snail so small
To conch shells standing tall.

Digitos made his foot
Into tentacles suit
For different kind of life
Through joy and through strife.

Digitos bore two sons:
Cephalopus when begun
The day, and Scaphopus,
Not quite so glorious.

Cephalopus studied long
And made his body strong
Through learning how to fly
With buoyancy on high.

He built a coiling shell
With chambers that would dwell
With gas for floating light
Through day and through the night.

Through this he learned to soar
Above the ocean floor.
He even built with care
Circulatory system there

Like Annelids and those
Of Chordates who propose
That closed systems are best
For meeting every test.

His mind grew sharp and keen,
The brightest ever seen
Among the mollusks all
Who answer ocean's call.

But Scaphopus lived lazy
In the ground so hazy.
He became ancestor
Of tusk shells, protector

Of nothing but his ease.
Simple creatures please
Themselves with brainless ways,
Living all their days

Underground they dwell
Within their tusk-like shell.
They prey on Foramer's sons
When hunting time begun.

Through this story we learn
How small choices earn
Great consequences wide
Across time's flowing tide.

The sons of Molluscus grew
And flourished, spreading through
The world in every way,
Taking roles each day

That others could not fill.
Through strength of mind and will
They rose from extinction's
Fire to distinctions

Great and glorious.
Molluscus victorious
Showed how from single start
Many forms depart

To fill each niche and place
With their unique grace.
From simple shell began
Evolution's great plan

That led to snails that crawl
And squids that enthrall
With intelligence bright
And bivalves' filtering sight.

The first extinction's flame
Could not destroy the name
Of those who build with care
Their future everywhere.

When fire rained from sky
And many had to die,
The builders who remained
Were those who had sustained

Their vision through the dark
And left their lasting mark
On world that needed those
Who from destruction rose.

Wiwaxius heard the call
To save life from the fall
And through his chosen sons
New chapters begun

Of life upon the earth
That celebrates the worth
Of building something strong
That will endure so long.

From Testar's sixteen plates
To forms that time creates
In endless variety,
The mollusks' piety

To building shows the way
That life can win the day
Against extinction's threat
When builders' skills are set

To work with patient art
That plays the vital part
In restoration's song
That makes the weak grow strong.

In every shell we see
Upon the sand so free,
Remember Molluscus' choice
To lift up building's voice

Above destruction's roar
And open up the door
To future filled with hope
Where builders help life cope

With challenges that come
Until the final sum
Of all their work is done
Beneath the shining sun.

The first extinction taught
That those who come to naught
Are those who do not build
But let their dreams be stilled.

But those who build with care
Will flourish everywhere
And fill the world with forms
That weather all life's storms.

From simplest shell's start
To cephalopod's art
Of swimming through the sea
With brain's complexity,

The mollusks show the way
That builders win the day
When extinction's fire
Would end life's choir.

Their shells protect and serve
Their forms with every curve
Designed for life's demands
In seas and on the lands.

So honor Molluscus' name
And his enduring fame
As father of the line
That shows building's divine

Power to restore
What was lost before
And make the world anew
With forms both strong and true.

---

While Molluscs were growing strong
And singing their success song,
We must not forget the foundation
Of Mithra's great creation.

First Amaterasu's light
Blesses us both day and night.
A millionth reaches Terra's seas
To feed life's mysteries.

And so the daughters of Bacta
Farm with light most attracta.
First among them, daughters all
Of Saya answer light's call.

The Blue Green Algae spread
Like living ocean's bread.
They farm the sunlight bright
From dawn until twilight.

The sons of Viros take
Their share for hunger's sake.
From daughters of Saya they steal
To make their viral meal.

And so the viruses were
The predators that were
While daughters of Saya became
The prey in this deadly game.

By viruses came new
Connections strange and true.
A link that none had seen
In life's ancestral scene.

The daughters of Pelagia,
Those sisters whose sagia
Benevolence would show
To all who live below,

The mitochondria's kin
Ate remnants thick and thin
Of Cyanobacteria.
Their numbers would hysteria

Create beyond conceiving—
So many past believing
Their multitudes would grow
In waters high and low.

And then there were of old
Purple farmers, brave and bold,
Who came before Saya's line
With photosynthesis fine.

Roseobella, daughter great
Of Elah's loving state
Of lesbian motherhood,
Among purple farmers stood

As planimal of the sea
Living wild and free.
She continues to this day
Her photosynthetic way.

Among these bacteria small
And viruses and all
The detritus that fell,
All were consumed well

By great crown-tails so fine,
The Choanoflagellates' line—
Our closest cousins true
In waters deep and blue.

Alongside sons of Choanos
Lived the tiny golden rados:
Golden Algae bright and fair
Floating everywhere.

The sons of Dinoflagellus
Saw prosperity's telltale thus
Of Chrysalgos and Choanos,
So they ate both, not manos.

And photosynthesized too
To get more energy through.
They gained more power each day
In their prosperous way.

In their prosperity
Their numbers grew, and see—
The water glowed so bright
In their phototrophic sight.

Their rituals lit the sea
With bioluminescence free.
The ocean sparkled wide
With their phosphorescent pride.

But soon they grew corrupt,
Their morals were abrupt.
The sons of Dinoflagellus
Turned to ways rebellious.

To cannibalism they turned,
While the water burned
Red with carnage from their feast—
They became a bloody beast.

The blood poisoned all
That answered nature's call.
Whatever it would touch
Would suffer very much.

And soon the Rotifers
Swooped in as officers
Of justice from above
With neither hate nor love.

Consuming remnants of
A civilization thereof
That once was great and proud,
The Rotifers ate loud

And grew fat from their meal,
Saving us from the ordeal
Of plague that would have spread
If they had not been fed.

Xanthus the Dinoflagellate
Saw carnage desolate
And fled from his own kind
To leave that death behind.

As he fled he saw afar
The great glass houses, par
Excellence of Diatoms
Who built their holy homes.

Immune to conquest's blight
Of Rotifers' appetite
And sons of Viros too,
The Diatoms lived true

As farmers of the light
Protected day and night
By walls of glass so clear
That kept them without fear.

Then he saw another sight:
Coccolithophores so bright
Who too grew with armor strong
To last their whole life long.

And so he cried out loud
To Mithra from the crowd:
"Why must my line be cursed
To be forever dispersed

Without such protections?
Must I face all rejections
And live life in danger
Like some lonely stranger?"

And then he saw the form
Of refuge from the storm:
Acanther, son of Radios,
A starry greenhouse, glorious.

A great greenhouse open wide
For him to come inside.
And so he went within
And found new life begin.

Within Acanther's frame
He found prosperity's name.
The Radiolarian's shell
Protected him so well.

As floating greenhouse bright
With glass that caught the light,
They farmed the algae green
In partnership serene.

Meanwhile the green algae
Grew so big, you see,
They found protection true
In numbers, through and through.

Sargassos, Lord of Kelp,
Called millions to his help.
He grew a city wide
Of cells on every side.

The greatest of them all
Who answered plankton's call,
His city millions strong
Would last his whole life long.

And so the Fungi came,
The sons of Chytros' name,
To break the great ones down
And earn decomposer's crown.

They ate them and released
A million spores increased
Throughout the watery realm
With Chytros at the helm.

The Fungi are the knights
Who balance nature's rights—
The Robinhoods of sea
Who live quite happily

Coexisting with the line
Of Oomycetes so fine—
The kelp who want to be
Fungi of the sea.

And so they brought the wealth
Of energy and health
To all the little ones
From great ones when day done.

From here the zooplankton
Emerged, their lives begon:
The sons of Foramer
And sons of Cilliofer.

The sons of Foramer
In soils would transfer
Their fishing to the seas
With greatest expertise.

They caught the spores and more—
Radiolarians by score
And all others they could find
Of every shape and kind.

Great shells they built with care
That lasted everywhere.
The snails built their homes
Upon these calcium domes.

The sons of Cilliofer
Were great ones who prefer
To use their cilia
To suck up bacteria

And other tiny food
Into their mouths so good.
With beating hairs they fed
And thus were nourished.

Tiny Trilobites came
To play the hunting game.
They ate the sons of both
Foramer and, by oath,

Cilliofer's children too,
As predators would do.
The food chain thus was made
Where each their role played.

The sons of Chordatus
Burrowed, most glorious,
Through soil to find the food
That from above renewed

Their bodies' every need.
Through gill slits they would feed,
Pumping water through their frame
To nourish in their name.

Out their atriopores
The water freely pours
When they have taken what
They need from nature's pot.

Great Chordatus begat
Two sons: Olfacter begat
And Lancelot the true
Who traditions knew.

Lancelot continued on
The ways his father's son
Had learned from ancient time
In rhythm and in rhyme.

But Olfacter bore two more:
Vertebratus to explore
The spinal cord's great art,
And Tunicatus' part.

Vertebratus worked each day
To perfect in every way
His spinal cord so fine
With neural design.

But Tunicatus chose
To rest where water flows.
He sat upon a rock
Like shepherd with his flock

And filtered water clean
Through systems never seen.
He pumped so much water through
His filter system grew

To be most of his frame—
Water was his name.
His body became the stream
Of his filtering dream.

Tunicatus bore two sons:
Larvaceus when day begun
And Ascidaceus true
Who different pathways knew.

Larvaceus never stayed
In one place, but made
A giant house of slime
That lasted for all time.

With mucus house so grand
He fished throughout the land
Of water, catching food
In nets of mucus good.

Ascidaceus became
Ancestor of fame
Of Sea Squirts everywhere
Who filter with great care.

A wooden tunic bright
Of cellulose so white
He built around his form
To keep him safe and warm.

His mouth on top would feed,
His atriopore indeed
Would let the water out
When filtering about.

Ascidaceus bore two more:
Stolidos to explore
And Proteus the wise
With penetrating eyes.

Proteus begat in time
Thallasus (so sublime)
And Enterogon the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

While brethren lived as squirts
Avoiding nature's hurts,
Thallasus built his city
Floating (what a pity

That none could match his art!)
Across the waters' heart.
His city sailed the sea
Most beautifully.

Thallasus bore a son
Named Dolios, lonely one
Who lived his life alone
And made the sea his home.

A solitary life
He lived through joy and strife,
Fishing on his own
Where he had grown.

The Arrow Worms would feed
On Dolios indeed,
As did the Trilobites
And Jellyfish's bites.

But Thallasus bore more
Sons to explore:
Pyros and Salpus too
Who cities built anew.

Pyros built a tube
So long, like a cube
Extended through the sea—
A city floating free.

Propelled by wastewater
Like some divine daughter
Of engineering's art,
Playing nature's part.

While Salpus built a chain
Through sun and storm and rain
Of beings linked as one
Until their work was done.

From Amaterasu's light
To creatures of the night,
The foundation firm
Of life's eternal term

Was laid by those who knew
That partnership is true
Between the great and small
Who answer nature's call.

The viruses and bacteria,
The algae's bright hysteria
Of photosynthetic life,
Through harmony, not strife,

Built up the living base
On which each higher race
Would find their nourishment
In ocean's element.

From Choanoflagellates
To Chordate's vertebrates,
The family tree grew wide
With ocean as their guide.

Each found their special way
To live from day to day:
Some filter, some hunt,
Some do photosynthetic stunt.

But all together made
The grand marine parade
Of life in all its forms
Through calm and raging storms.

The sons of Chordatus show
How spinal cords can grow
To be the foundation true
Of intelligence new.

While Tunicates remind
Us not to be confined
To just one way of life—
Diversity ends strife.

From tiny plankton small
To creatures standing tall,
The ocean's family tree
Lives through eternity.

In every drop of sea
Lives their legacy:
The builders of the base
Of life's eternal grace.

---

While sons of Tunicus filtered
The seas and never withered,
Vertebratus built with care
A spinal cord beyond compare.

Great segments made of bone
He built for his own
With yellow teeth of keratin
To start his line's great thing.

Vertebratus begat Rene,
Who built in his own way
A great unified design
Of parts both yours and mine.

No longer were they scattered
On sides, all broken and tattered.
His nephridia and parts
Generative, close to hearts,

Now lived within the core
Of his being, and what's more,
They were centralized as one
When his great work was done.

Rene begat with pride
Hemos, who lived inside
His new generative frame
To earn eternal fame.

Hemos built a brain
Bigger than all's remain.
Greater than all the rest
Who ever faced life's test.

He built blood vessels wide
As offering with pride
To Hausa up above
Who blessed with holy love.

Hausa looked down and saw
This gift without a flaw
And blessed him from on high
Beneath the starry sky.

She transformed with grace
A line within his place:
His servants she made red
To keep his brain well-fed.

Carriers of oxygen bright
They carried day and night
The breath of life so pure
To make his brain endure.

And so his brain was fed
And nourished as was said.
Always strong and bright
With oxygen's pure sight.

Hemos begat Haikus,
Little fish most glorious,
Who thought that he could not
Achieve what he had sought.

He thought he couldn't fly
Beneath the ocean sky.
But then he said with might
To make his future bright:

"I think I can,
I think I can,
I think I can
Fulfill my plan."

And then he flew so free
Across the boundless sea.
His faith had set him loose
From doubt's restraining noose.

Haikus became the most
Accomplished of his host.
In all his noble line
None could match his design.

Haikus begat two sons:
Lampris when day begun
And Denton, strong and true,
Who great things would do.

Denton built teeth white
With enamel shining bright.
Great teeth that gleamed and shone
Like ivory and bone.

And so Denton became
The Eloh of great name
Of Dentistry and Teeth—
Protection and relief.

To this day we honor
Denton as our donor
Of healthy teeth and gums
Through daily mouth-rite sums.

This rite involves a practice
That keeps our teeth attractive.
Though strange it seems to some,
We do it until done.

We take a bundle small
Of hoghairs, one and all,
And insert it in our mouth
From north down to the south.

Along with magical powders
That make our mouth talk louders,
We move the bundle round
In gestures quite profound.

A highly formalized dance
Of cleaning's circumstance,
Through movements tried and true
We make our teeth renew.

Once or twice each year
We seek without any fear
The holy-mouth-man priest
Who holds the dental feast.

These priests have tools
That follow sacred rules:
Augers, awls, and probes,
And prods in priestly robes.

The use of these in rite
Exorcises blight
Of evils in the mouth
Through ritual truth.

The holy-mouth-man opens
Our mouths as faith hopes and
Uses tools mentioned well
To break decay's fell spell.

He enlarges every hole
That decay has made our goal
To stop, with substances
Of magical defenses.

If no holes can be found
In teeth healthy and sound,
Large sections he gouges out
To remove all doubt

That supernatural stuff
Can be applied enough
To arrest the bad decay
And keep it well at bay.

The purpose clear as day:
To arrest decay's display
And draw friends near
With smiles bright and clear.

These traditions we maintain
Through sunshine and through rain
As long as Denton smiles
Upon us through the miles.

By Denton's holy will
His sons shall have their fill
Of freedom to seek care
From mouth-priests everywhere.

Never shall poverty
Deny this charity.
The great hero's demand—
Notgnihsaw's command—

Ensures that all are free
To seek dentistry
Regardless of their gold
As heroes of old.

Conodontus begat
Two sons: first Conodon begat
The biter, strong and keen,
And Pterapsis, serene

Yet mighty Pterapsis
Built armor's emphasis.
A great suit, strong and bright,
To shield him in the fight.

Conodon was the bearer
Of teeth, terror's sharer.
With great speed he swam
Through water like a ram.

His teeth were sharp and strong,
They served him his whole life long.
A predator was he
Throughout the boundless sea.

Pterapsis chose defense
With armor's permanence.
A suit he built with care
To protect him everywhere.

Among all Cambrius' sons
When their race begun,
The sons of Haikus would
Become the greatest good.

But this was not to be
Immediately.
Time would have to pass
Before they held first class.

Ghosts struck Terra's form
In a devastating storm.
They wrecked it to the core
And opened up death's door.

The sons of Conodon fell,
Their story none could tell.
They disappeared from sight
Into eternal night.

Their teeth marked the end
Of an era, my friend.
The Cambrian time was done,
A new age had begun.

And so the Ordovician
Came with great precision.
The sons of Conodon rose
Again from their repose

To mark this era new
With teeth both strong and true.
New teeth for the new day
To show a better way.

From Vertebratus' start
With his spinal art
To Denton's teeth so white
And Haikus' faithful flight,

The vertebrate design
Became more refined.
Each generation grew
More complex through and through.

The centralized kidney
Made them quite giddy
With efficiency gained
That long time remained.

The brain that Hemos built
Without any guilt
Became the template true
For all who would pursue

Intelligence and thought
That could not be bought
But had to be earned
Through lessons hard-learned.

The red blood cells so bright
That carried oxygen's light
To feed the growing brain
Through pleasure and through pain

Became the innovation
Of every generation
That followed in their wake
For evolution's sake.

From little fish who thought
He couldn't, until he sought
The power of belief
To overcome his grief,

Came lineages strong
That would last life-long
And grow to rule the seas
With greatest expertise.

The teeth that Denton made
Will never ever fade
From vertebrate design—
Protection so fine

Against the world's hard food
That must be pursued
And broken down to size
Before it satisfies.

The armor that protects
And speed that intersects
With predatory art
Both played their vital part

In vertebrate success
Through trial and duress.
Both defense and attack
Kept evolution on track.

When ghosts brought the end
To era, and rend
The world apart once more,
It opened up the door

For new innovations
Across all the nations
Of life upon the earth
To show their truest worth.

The teeth that marked the time
In rhythm and in rhyme
Of old era's end
And new one's ascend

Show how life persists
Through time's twists
And always finds a way
To live another day.

From Haikus' faithful phrase—
"I think I can"—that stays
With all who dare to dream
Of more than what they seem,

Came vertebrates so bright
Who filled the world with sight
Of what is possible
When faith is plausible.

The holy-mouth-men show
How traditions grow
From ancient dental art
To play the healing part.

Though strange to outside eyes
Our dental rites comprise
A sacred bond we keep
With ancestors so deep.

In every toothbrush stroke
And every dental yoke
We honor Denton's name
And his enduring fame.

The centralization
Of each generation's
Organs in the core
Opened up the door

For complexity
And great ability
To coordinate and plan
Since vertebrates began.

From simple spinal cord
To complex brain's word
Of wisdom and of thought,
The vertebrates have fought

To earn their rightful place
In evolution's race
Through innovation true
And faith in what they knew.

The Ordovician dawn
When old age was withdrawn
Brought new opportunities
For new communities

Of vertebrates to rise
Beneath Ordovician skies
And show what they could do
With innovations new.

In every vertebrate spine
And every tooth so fine,
Remember those who built
The foundation without guilt

Of all that we hold dear
Throughout each passing year:
The brain, the blood, the bone,
All from one line grown

That dared to centralize
And organize with eyes
On future's bright reward
For those who trust the Lord

Of evolution's way
From night into the day
Of consciousness and thought
That cannot be bought

But must be earned with care
By those who always dare
To build a better way
For life's eternal day.

---

The Ordovician began
With great extinction's plan—
Or did it? Sages still debate
What caused that fearsome fate.

Were these great ghosts real
With power none could feel
Beyond belief so strong,
Or myths that passed along?

The Sages cannot agree
On what they claim to see
In mists of ancient time
Where truth and myth combine.

After the mists cleared
And new dawn appeared,
The world was greater still
Than any mortal will

Could have imagined then.
The Planktonic Planimals when
They fed brought forth new life
Through harmony, not strife.

Leviathan arose,
Great dragon, friend not foes.
Son of wicked king Magog,
He ruled through wisdom's log.

Though born of evil seed,
Leviathan would lead
His kingdom not to war
But peace forevermore.

To peaceful prosperity
His realm in clarity
Grew under his wise rule
Like some divine school.

The sons of Leviathan
Grew greater than began
Any before their time:
Tenscore myriads prime

Of microns was their length.
Their body politic's strength
Was great and full of power
Through every passing hour.

His sons inherited
The greatness that was bred
Into their very souls
To play their vital roles.

The sons of Leviathan ruled
The world, and never fooled
By power's corruption,
They brought life's construction

With justice great and true.
They shepherded all who
Were sons of Bios fair
With love and gentle care.

From small planktonic ones
To vicious warrior sons—
The Anomalocarids—
All felt their benefits.

Ordovices the son
Of Leviathan begun
The greatest reign of all
When he would hear the call

To be Emperor supreme.
He built beyond all dream
Great cities of such fame
That "reefs" became their name.

And so economy
Grew in harmony
Like never seen before
From mountain peak to shore.

In great Coral cities
Where beauty never pities
Those who cannot see
Their vast complexity,

The sons of Euka came
From places without name
Far and wide they traveled
As mysteries unraveled.

Ordovices put to work
The sons of Cnider (perk
Of wisdom's gentle hand)
Throughout his peaceful land.

And so the sons of Anthus
Built cities, cantus
Of beauty rising high
Beneath the ocean sky.

Ordovices had daughters
Of Coraline build waters
Into living stone—
She, daughter all her own

Of Florida, who came
From Rhodes of ancient name.
They built coralline Algae,
The plaster, galaxy

Upon the great Corals.
Their work through all portals
Of time would long endure
With beauty clean and pure.

Ordovices saw clear
That sons of Bryos here
Had no home to call
Their own, and heard their call.

And so he blessed them well
With homes where they could dwell
Within the great reefs bright
Both day and through the night.

To this day reefs stand
As monuments so grand
Of Ordovices' art
That built with gentle heart

The most prosperous cities
Where life shows no pities
For those who cannot see
Their vast complexity.

On Terra and beyond
These reefs form the bond
Between all living things
That peace and order brings.

The coral cities rise
Beneath the ocean skies
With architecture fine
Both humble and divine.

In every coral branch
And every firm stanch
Foundation built with care
Lives beauty everywhere.

The shoals of fish so bright
Dance in the crystal light
That filters through the reef
Beyond all belief.

Each creature has its place
Within this living space
Where harmony is law
Without the slightest flaw.

The algae and the coral
Live in ways most moral,
Each helping other grow
In partnership's flow.

The Bryozoans small
Build cities, one and all,
Upon the coral's frame
To share in nature's game.

The fish find shelter here
From predators they fear,
While hunters find their prey
Throughout the night and day.

And so economy
Grew in perfect harmony
Under wise Ordovices
Whose rule brought life its prizes.

He became known through time
As "Ordovices the Prime"
Of wisdom, and his boom
Dispelled all sense of doom

That hung over the past
When extinctions last
Had threatened life with death
And stole away its breath.

This boom became the name
Of GOBE—greatest fame
The Great Ordovician
Event, magician

Of biodiversity
That brought complexity
Beyond what was before
To every sea and shore.

The life within the seas
Became what always pleased
The heart that loves to see
Life's creativity.

More prosperous it grew
With species old and new
Finding their perfect place
In evolution's race.

And it would only grow
Greater, as we know,
More prosperous and bright
Under Ordovician might.

Under the great dynasty
Of wisdom's sovereignty
'Twas the first Golden Age
In life's eternal page.

The reefs became the heart
Of nature's living art
Where beauty and function
Met in perfect junction.

From Leviathan's wise choice
To let peace be his voice
Instead of war and strife
Came this abundant life.

His son Ordovices
Built cities that are prizes
Still today we see
In reef's complexity.

The coral and the stone,
Each species on its own
Yet working as a whole
To play its vital role,

Show us how to build
Communities that yield
Prosperity for all
Who answer wisdom's call.

In every living reef
Beyond all belief
We see the legacy
Of this great dynasty

That chose to build, not break,
For all life's sake
A world where every creature
Has its special feature

And role to play within
The symphony therein
Of life in all its forms
Through calm and raging storms.

The Ordovician way
Lives on to this day
In every coral city
Both grand and gritty

That rises from the sea
In perfect harmony
Of form and function blessed
By wisdom's gentle rest.

From Leviathan's peace
To reefs that never cease
To grow in beauty bright,
We see that might

Is not in conquest's sword
But in the gentle word
That builds instead methodically
That tears so wreck systematically.

The first Golden Age
Wrote upon history's page
The lesson clear and true:
That what we choose to do

With power in our hands
Determines if the lands
And seas will flourish well
Or under curses dwell.

Ordovices chose to build
And his wisdom filled
The world with life so bright
It still brings us delight.

In every coral's growth
And every sacred oath
To build and not destroy,
We find life's truest joy.

The Great Ordovician
Biodiversification
Event shows what can come
When wisdom's ways we sum

Into our daily choice
To let peace be our voice
And building be our art
With love within our heart.

The reefs that grow today
In their prosperous way
Are children of that time
When reason was in rhyme

With nature's deepest law:
That beauty without flaw
Comes not from force and might
But from love's gentle sight

That sees in every creature
A perfect, special feature
Worth protecting well
As stories always tell

Of Leviathan's son
Whose work is never done
As long as reefs still grow
In beauty's endless flow.

While Trilobites ruled the seas
With their great dynasties,
The rivers flowed so free
For lesser brethren's spree.

The sons of Arachnus ruled
The seas where they schooled
Their children in the art
Of playing their sea part.

The sons of Insectus took
The rivers like a book
Of opportunities
For their communities.

The sons of Cain and Abel
Ruled the lands, quite able
To make their living there
In terrestrial air.

And so Crustaceus saw
No place without a flaw
Where he could make his stand
In sea or stream or land.

Yet nowhere left to go,
He tried despite the woe
To establish his line
With dynasty so fine.

Heaven rewards the heart
That plays determination's part
To rise above all plight
And reach for greater height.

Crustaceus begat two:
Karkon and Mushi too,
Each son to find his way
Through life from day to day.

Mushi begat two sons:
Copepus when day begun
And Lepipus the strange
Throughout his living range.

Copepus became the sire
Of copepods' choir—
The little ones so small
Who answer ocean's call.

Insects of every form
Through calm and raging storm
They swam throughout the sea
In their complexity.

The tiniest of all
Who hear the ocean's call,
They dance throughout the waves
In their microscopic graves.

Meanwhile Lepipus bore
Two sons to explore:
Brachios of the sea
And Silvio running free.

A daughter of Silvio
Would someday help the flow
Of insects to the land
By evolution's hand.

Some day millions hence
The sons of Silvio's sense
Would become the great
Insects that dominate

The world in every place
With their six-legged grace.
But that day was not near—
They had to persevere.

Brachios became the father
Of sea monkeys (why bother
With complex names?) and more:
Water fleas by the score.

In natural habitat
They lived both this and that:
Sea monkeys in their pools
And water fleas like jewels

Dancing through the water
Each son and each daughter
Living simple lives
Where small beauty thrives.

Karkon fled away
To open waters gray
Where he begat two more:
Pancer to explore

And Cephalocaridus
Most glorious,
Each finding their own way
Through life from day to day.

Pancer begat in time
Two sons in their prime:
Oligostracus small
And Polycruster tall.

Oligostracus bore
Many sons to explore
The waters far and wide
With courage as their guide.

Among his sons were found
The seed shrimp, safe and sound,
And degenerate tongue worms
Who broke from proper norms.

These tongue worms chose to live
As parasites who give
Nothing back in trade—
Poor choices they have made.

Instead of getting jobs
Like other honest mobs,
They live off others' work
And in the shadows lurk.

Polycruster begat
Two sons: Barnacus begat
And Malacus the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Barnacus was a man
Who had a frontier plan.
A great frontiersman he,
Who lived quite happily

Settled down with stalk
Upon the ground to walk
No more, but live instead
Like cnidarians bred.

Like sons of Cnider's line
He lived his life so fine
Attached unto the ground
Where he had settled down.

Barnacus bore a son
He named Goose when begun
The day. Great Goose was he
Who built society

Most wondrous to behold,
But truth be told—
No matter how he tried
With all his foolish pride,

He never did become
A goose (though some
Still claim his lineage
Is goose heritage).

Goose still claimed his sons
Were geese when day begun.
And so he is the guide
Of geese with sacred pride.

The Eloh of the Geese
He brings them sweet peace
And guides them on their way
Throughout each passing day.

In medieval lore
They told (and tell much more)
Of how the geese would grow
From barnacles below

Hanging from the trees
In shells upon the breeze
Until they could grow feathers
In all kinds of weathers

And fly away at last
When growing time had passed.
Gerald of Wales told
This story of old.

Among the sons of Goose
Many would let loose
Their size and grow quite small
And compact, one and all.

They became Barnacles
Like small-scale miracles—
Half shrimp and half coral,
Full animals with moral

Lives upon the rock
Like shepherd with his flock
They filter from the sea
Their food quite happily.

Malacus bore many
Descendants—more than any
Could count throughout the years
Through joys and through tears.

Among them crabs so bold
And shrimp whose stories told
Of grace beneath the waves
In their ocean caves.

The isopods were there
And amphipods everywhere,
Each playing their own part
In evolution's art.

They would become a dynasty
So great in their spree
That none could match their might
In future's shining sight.

So great that when we speak
Of Crustaceus' mystique
We speak first and foremost
Of Malacus' great host

Whose dynasty was yet
To reach the glory set
Before them in the time
When they would reach their prime.

Under Trilobites' yoke
They lived like gentle folk
Awaiting their great day
When they would lead the way.

But patience is the key
To life's great mystery.
The crustaceans would wait
For their appointed fate.

From Crustaceus' start
With determination's heart
To rise above his plight
And reach for greater height,

Came lineages strong
That would last life-long
And fill the seas with forms
Through calm and raging storms.

The copepods so small
Who answer ocean's call,
The barnacles on rocks
Like shepherds with their flocks,

The crabs with claws so strong,
The shrimp that swim along
The ocean's currents free,
All from one family tree

That started with one brave
Soul who would not cave
To circumstances dire
But reached for something higher.

In every tiny copepod
Dancing like a small god
Throughout the ocean blue,
Remember what is true:

That size does not determine
What spirits can affirm.
The smallest can be great
If they don't hesitate

To try despite the odds
Against them, trusting gods
To reward determination
In every generation.

In every barnacle
That grows like miracle
Upon the rocky shore
Where waves forever more

Will crash and spray and foam,
Remember those who roam
Not through space but time
To find their perfect rhyme

With life's eternal song
That carries us along
Through all our trials here
To what we hold most dear.

The sons of Crustaceus show
How those who will not bow
To circumstance or fate
Can rise to something great.

Though Trilobites held sway
In that ancient day,
The future would reveal
What time would help heal:

That patient persistence
And faithful existence
Will triumph in the end
When time becomes our friend.

From rivers to the sea,
From bondage to the free,
The crustaceans would rise
To claim their destined prize.

But that is yet to come
When current ages sum
Their lessons into wisdom
Of life's eternal kingdom.

For now they wait and grow
And learn what they must know
To be ready for the day
When they will lead the way.

In patience they find strength,
In time they find at length
The preparation needed
For when their time's succeeded.

Heaven rewards those who try
To reach beyond the sky
Of present circumstance
To future's greater dance.

Crustaceus showed the way
That leads to greater day:
Determination true
Will see all struggles through.

His sons throughout the sea
Live on eternally
As proof that those who dare
To dream beyond despair

Will find their rightful place
In evolution's race
When time reveals at last
The future from the past.

Among the sons of Molluscus
Were twisted ones, most glorious:
The sons of Gastropus,
Renowned and prosperous.

Gastropus twisted each
Son beyond our reach
Of understanding strange:
Their anus he'd arrange

Next to their heads so near
That all could see quite clear
This anatomical design
So twisted yet so fine.

And so by this great art
Each son could wholly part
From danger's threatening call
By pulling in completely all

Within their shell so tight
Protected day and night
From any enemy
Who'd harm their family.

The sons of Gastropus
Outnumbered, glorious,
All other classes made.
In history's parade

Only the Insects great
Would ever duplicate
Their numbers through the years
Despite all joys and fears.

The Priests of Gastropus
Wear robes so glorious
Of Tyrian purple bright
To show their royal sight.

The regal mucus shows
How majesty still grows
From Gastropus' great kingdom
Through all its wisdom.

In year of eight thousand
Four hundred thirty, band
Of Phoenicians came
To conquer and to claim

The great Gastropod Empire
And set their hearts on fire
For the sacred priestly dye
Beneath the purple sky.

From them it came at last
To Romans of the past,
And to this very day
When purple comes our way

We think of Majesty
And royal sovereignty
That flows from Gastropus
So rich and glorious.

Just as his majesty
Was purple, heavenly,
His faith was colored blue
Forever pure and true.

In time of Moses great
Prince Hexaplex' fate
Would bless him with the gift
Of tassels that would lift

The spirits of the true
Devotees in blue
Who wear the tassels still
According to God's will.

Many who follow
Moses' path so hollow
Not in emptiness
But filled with faith's caress

Wear tassels blue with faith
That never comes to scathe
But strengthens every day
Those who walk this way.

Limpus was firstborn son
Of Gastropus when begun
His line. His sons became
The Limpets of great fame.

His daughters, fair and bright,
Were Limpettes in God's sight,
Each playing their own part
With faithful, loyal heart.

The Limpets are the keepers
Of tradition, not sleepers
But watchmen through the night
Who guard what is right.

Limpus said to all
His children, great and small,
Ten thousands in their number
Who never would slumber:

"Everyone who hears
These words through all the years
Of mine, and does them true,
I'll liken him to you

Who builds his house on rock
Like shepherd with his flock.
The rain may come down hard,
But he will not be scarred.

The floods may come to beat,
The winds may bring defeat
To others, but his house
Will stand through every rouse

Of storm, for it was founded
On rock that has been grounded
In truth that will not move
Through all that I approve.

But everyone who hears
These words through all his years
And does them not, I say,
Will be like one who'd lay

His foundation on sand
Built by his own hand.
The rain will come down hard,
And he'll be deeply scarred.

The floods will come to beat,
The winds will bring defeat,
And beat upon his house
Until it can't arouse

Itself from its collapse—
Great will be its lapse
Into destruction's pit
Where nothing more will fit."

The Limpets build their homes
On rocks where ocean roams,
Not sand that shifts about
With every storm's great shout.

As waves bellow and beat
Against them, in the heat
Of battle with the sea,
The Limpets firmly be

Standing their ground so true
Like soldiers tried and true
Who never leave their post
Though tempest be their host.

When Limpets move, they go
Always, as we know,
Home to their rocky place
Where they found their space.

As their father before
Did from shore to shore,
The Limpets merge their shell
To rock, and there they dwell

Growing intricate fits
To their foundation's bits,
Each shell shaped perfectly
To match rock's geometry.

And so we sing the hymn
Of Limpus when grows dim
Our hope and we feel lost,
That we might count the cost

And always return home
No matter where we roam
Throughout this world so wide
With Limpus as our guide.

"My hope is built on naught
But what Limpus has brought:
His blood and righteousness
That brings us faithfulness.

I dare not trust the frame
However sweet its name,
But wholly trust in his—
In Limpus' name is bliss.

Limpus the solid Rock
I stand like shepherd's flock;
All other ground's just sand
That sinks beneath my hand.

All other ground's just sand
That will not help me stand."

Snellon, youngest son
Of Gastropus, begun
Not tradition's way
But innovation's day.

He stood for something new,
For progress through and through.
Snellon bore two sons:
Vetigas when begun

The day, and Escargon
Whose work would carry on
The family's great name
Through innovation's flame.

Vetigas bore two more:
Trochus to explore
And Avalon so strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Trochus became the sire
Of snails whose desire
Is cleaning far and wide:
Turban snails with pride

And Trochus snails as well,
Dutiful, they tell
Us how to clean with care
Aquaria everywhere

And ecosystems too
With work they love to do.
They polish and they scrub
Like members of a club

Devoted to the art
Of playing cleaning's part
In nature's great design
Where all things work so fine.

Avalon became
Ancestor of fame
Of Abalones great
Who never hesitate

To show their hardy ways.
Through all their living days
With pores within their shell
For breathing, they dwell

Rough on the outside
But beauty can't hide
Within their inner space
Where colors interlace

In patterns beautiful
Beyond what's dutiful—
Art that takes the breath
Away from life and death.

Escargon coiled his shell
More than words can tell
And bore two sons whose coils
Surpassed all earthly toils

In their complexity:
Neritus, you see,
And Conchus, strong and true,
Each with work to do.

Neritus became
Ancestor of fame
Of snails with lids so tight
That close from any sight

When hiding from their foes.
Impenetrable, close
Their shells when danger's near—
No enemy they fear.

Conchus bore two sons:
Marius when begun
The day, who ruled the sea,
And Heterobran, free

To fly through ocean skies
With wonder in his eyes
And grace in every move
As he would always prove.

Marius of the Sea
Became ancestry
Of many little snails
Whose beauty never fails

Across the seas so wide:
Periwinkles with pride,
And Cowries beautiful,
And Wentletraps so full

Of spiral elegance,
Moon Snails in their dance,
And Murexes so bright,
Cone Snails in their might,

And Turrids spiral-wise
Beneath the ocean skies,
Each playing their own part
In evolution's art.

The surfing snails move fast
At breakneck speed, at last
Across the shores they ride
With ocean as their guide.

Here is the story told
Of daughters brave and bold:
Olivella and her sister
Agaronia, who'd never missed her

Chance to surf the waves
Like ocean's bravest slaves
To speed and to the thrill
Of riding ocean's will.

Daughters of Olivius
The surfer, glorious
In his art upon
The waves from dusk to dawn.

The Cone Snails are named
Deceptively, acclaimed
For beauty, but they're really
Assassins who kill freely

With poison strong beyond
All that we're fond
Of thinking possible—
Nothing's defensible

Against their deadly art.
They live set apart
Between life and death's door
Like guardians of lore

Otherworldly, bright
With beauty that's sight
To see, but death to touch
For those who dare too much.

Cowries are devotees
Of goddess Cuprias,
And by her blessing great
They did create

The first money ever made
From shells in ocean's trade.
Their shells became the way
To buy and sell each day.

In China's ancient script
Their shells are never skipped—
The character for money
Shows their legacy

Immortalized in stone
By those who've always known
Their value through the years
Despite all joys and fears.

The Murexes were known
As hedgehog snails full-grown
With beautiful bright hues
And colors we might use

To dye our clothes so fine
In patterns that would shine
With rainbow's every shade
That nature ever made.

The great Conches so fair
Were beautiful beyond compare,
Adorable and sweet
With melodies complete

That echoed through the sea
In perfect harmony
When they would blow their horn
From evening until morn.

Heterobran of skies
Was swimmer with bright eyes
Par excellence in art
Of swimming's every part.

Heterobran begat
Two children: first he gat
Nudos, strong and free,
And Aeros of the sea.

Nudos shed his shell
And untwisted as well
Himself from gastropod
Design, and so he trod

A different path than most.
He became the host
Of nudibranches bright:
Colorful sea-sprite

Slugs with poison strong
Enough to sing death's song
To Leviathan great—
Such is their potent fate.

Aeros swam so free
In waters of the sea
Without a care or worry
Never in a hurry

But taking his sweet time
To perfect every rhyme
Of motion through the waves
In ocean's liquid caves.

Aeros bore in time
A son and daughter fine:
Pulmon, strong and great,
And Angelica's fate

Was to become the mother
Of sea butterflies, and other
Beautiful swimming forms
Through calm and raging storms

Whose ethereal existence
Eludes at every distance
Most who try to see
Their liquid poetry.

Like butterflies of air
But swimming everywhere
Through ocean's liquid space
With otherworldly grace.

But Pulmon the great
Had a different fate.
Revered ancestor he
Did what none could see

Was possible before
From mountain peak to shore:
He inhaled breath of air
And made his body's lair

A lung where he could store
The breath forevermore
That let him survive
The tide pools, stay alive

When water went away
Throughout the changing day
Like none of his kin
Had ever done therein.

From Gastropus' twist
That none could have missed
To Pulmon's breathing art
That gave him a new start

In evolution's race
Where each must find their place,
The gastropods have shown
How far they've grown

From simple, twisted start
To mastery of art
Both in the sea so deep
And tide pools where they keep

Their vigil night and day
In their devoted way
To life in all its forms
Through calm and raging storms.

In every spiral shell
That stories always tell
Of beauty and of function
Working in conjunction,

Remember how they came
To earn their lasting fame:
Through innovation's art
And tradition's heart

Both working side by side
With ocean as their guide
To fill each living niche
With forms beyond our reach

Of understanding full
But beautiful

To see in all their glory
Throughout life's endless story.

From Limpets holding fast
To rocks that ever last
To sea slugs poison-bright
Swimming day and night,

From money-making shells
To assassins who dwells
Between the life and death
With poison in their breath,

The gastropods show how
Diversity can bow
To no single way
But flourishes each day

In myriad different forms
Through calm and raging storms
That test what each can do
To make their dreams come true.

Innovation and tradition
Working in submission
To life's eternal call
That beckons one and all

To find their perfect place
In evolution's race
Where beauty and function
Meet in perfect junction.

Esther was the daughter true
In the tenth generation's view
Of Lily the Echidna,
Dutrus' daughter, fina

Who traded bilateral
For pentaradial
Design, and thus began
Evolution's plan

For five-fold symmetry
Throughout eternity.
Esther saw before
Her eyes from shore to shore

Innumerable hosts
Of planktonic ghosts—
The planimals so small
Who answered feeding's call.

To feed off them she tried
With hunger as her guide.
And from her loins she bore
Two daughters to explore

The seas in their own way:
Crinosa, night and day,
And Blastosa the strong
Who lived her whole life long.

Blastosa built a city
Beyond all that's gritty
With many brachioles
Around ambulacra's goals.

Each ambulacrum bright
Was ringed throughout the night
And day with arms so small
That answered feeding's call.

Blastosa became mother
To forms like no other:
The Blastoids were her line
With architecture fine.

Her daughters spread so wide
With pentamerous pride
Throughout the ancient seas
Like blossoms on the trees.

Crinosa begat two:
Lily Stone so true
And Luther, strong and free,
Who lived beside the sea.

Lily Stone became
Ancestress of fame
Of Crinoids everywhere
Who danced with graceful flair.

Together Crinoids bright
And Blastoids in their might
Spread all across the seas
Like flowers in the breeze.

They became the wall
That answered empire's call:
The bulwark strong and true
Of Ordovician view.

The empire found in them
Its strongest living stem
That held against all foes
Through calm and storm's throes.

But Luther was not pleased
With leisure life that ceased
To challenge and to grow—
He felt he had to go

Beyond what others did
Though comfort life forbid
Such struggle and such strife
In his adventurous life.

In youth he grew a stalk
Like others of his flock,
But as he came of age
He broke from tradition's cage.

Contrary to his sister
Who'd never be a mister
But lived the gentle way
Of filter-feeding's day,

He used his arms to walk
Like some strange kind of stalk
That moved across the ground
Where freedom could be found.

His tube feet crawled with might
Both day and through the night
Upon the ocean floor
From here to distant shore.

He struggled, but was free
To live beside the sea
In his own chosen way
From night into the day.

To this day Starfish keep
This tradition deep
Within their very souls:
To play mobile roles.

Luther bore two sons:
Asteros when begun
The day, and Echinos
Whose different spirit knows

Innovation's call
Above tradition's thrall.
Asteros was the one
Who when his work was done

Stayed traditional and true
To all his fathers knew.
But Echinos built new
Ways to make dreams come true.

Echinos built compact
His city, and in fact
Used only tube feet small
To move and heed the call

Of wandering desire.
He never would aspire
To build a stalk like dad—
Innovation made him glad.

Asteros and Echinos
Went to war (heaven knows
Why brothers had to fight
Throughout the day and night).

Each with a million sons
Arranged when day begun
In armies vast and wide
With warfare as their guide.

The ancient battles rage
Across history's page
As photos still can show
From eons long ago.

Asteros begat
Two sons: first he begat
Starfy, strong and true,
And Ophis, through and through

A warrior in his heart
Who played the fighting part
With vigor and with might
Both day and through the night.

Echinos bore two more:
Orbos to explore
And Britta, daughter fair
Who danced without a care.

But Ophis and fair Britta
Broke the war's bitter
Cycle of revenge
And chose to make a change.

They married and became
Partners without shame
Despite their fathers' war
That raged from shore to shore.

From their union came
Children of great fame:
The Brittle Stars so bright,
Centralized in might.

Muscular creatures, they
Were machines in every way
Of strength and vigor great
Who never would abate

Their energy and power
Throughout each passing hour
Of their devoted lives
Where motion always thrives.

Serpentus, Ophis' son,
And Baskette, when begun
The day from Britta's line,
Both had designs so fine.

Serpentus became sire
Of forms whose desire
Was slithering with grace
Across the ocean's face.

The Serpent Stars he made
In ocean's light and shade
Would slither with precision
Through every dark decision

Of where to hunt their prey
Throughout the night and day.
Their tube feet were not meant
For moving, but were bent

To other tasks at hand
While muscles through the land
Of sea would make them glide
With ocean as their guide.

But Baskette was unique—
Her arms would always seek
To branch a million-fold
As stories have been told.

She ate all plankton small
Who answered ocean's call
With arms that branched so wide
Like nets on every side.

She became ancestress
Of Basket Stars no less
Remarkable than she
In their complexity.

Their arms branch out like trees
To catch what ocean sees
Fit to provide as food
In their planktonic mood.

Starfy begat the race
Of Starfish in every place:
Decentralized cities
Beyond all that's gritty

That may regenerate
From parts, however great
Or small the piece remains
When damage life constrains.

The Starfish are the lords
Who rule with iron swords
Their empires far and wide
With predatory pride.

They are vicious hunters
Who never are confronters
Of weakness, but instead
Fill other hearts with dread.

That's why they have five hands
To rule their ocean lands
With fingers made of might
Both day and through the night.

Echinos bore two sons:
Aristotle when begun
The day, and Cucus strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Aristotle became
The father of great fame
Of Sea Urchins everywhere
Who graze with greatest care.

Great grazers of the seas
They move with graceful ease
Across the ocean floor
From here to distant shore.

Aristotle built with care
A jaw beyond compare
Of five teeth strong and bright—
He called it his "light"

His lantern, for it brought
Light to life and thought.
To this day we call
This jaw by name of all

His choosing: "Aristotle's
Lantern" never throttles
Our wonder at the way
He lit his every day.

His great-granddaughter fair
Was Sandy, everywhere
Known as ancestress
Of Sand Dollars no less

Beautiful than she
In their complexity.
Flat and round they lie
Beneath the ocean sky.

Cucus became the sire
Of forms whose desire
Was recycling the waste
That others had misplaced.

The Sea Cucumbers great
Accept as their fate
To be the janitors
Of ocean's corridors.

The great recyclers who
Work their whole life through
In ocean's deepest parts
With dedicated hearts.

And when their enemies
Threaten, then they seize
Upon a strategy
Most shocking to see:

They spill their guts with might
To put their foes to flight.
What seems like weakness shows
The power to dispose

Of threats in their own way
That works both night and day
To keep them safe and sound
Though strange it may be found.

And so the Sons of grand
Echidna through the land
Of sea built their great
Civilization's fate

To heights beyond all speech
That mortals' words can reach
With five sides to each story
In all their living glory.

From Esther's feeding start
To Luther's rebel heart
That broke from leisure's chain
To walk through joy and pain,

From Asteros and his brother
Echinos, and no other
Way to settle their debate
Than war to seal their fate,

From Ophis and fair Britta
Who made the war less bitter
By choosing love instead
Of letting hatred spread,

The echinoderms show
How families can grow
From single pentamerous
Design so glorious

Into forms so diverse
That no single verse
Could capture all their ways
Throughout their living days.

From stalked sea lilies
To mobile enemies
Who hunt with five-armed might,
From grazers day and night

To recyclers who clean
The ocean's vast marine
Environment with care
For all who dwell there,

The five-fold symmetry
Lives through eternity
In every starfish arm
And every sea urchin's charm.

In every brittle star
That travels near and far
With muscles flexing strong
Throughout its whole life long,

In every crinoid's dance
And every basket's stance
With arms like trees spread wide
To catch the ocean's tide

Of plankton floating by
Beneath the starry sky,
The legacy lives on
From dusk until the dawn

Of Echidna's great choice
To let five be the voice
Of symmetry's design
Throughout the end of time.

From bilateral start
To pentamerous art
That rules the ocean floor
From mountain peak to shore,

The echinoderms remind
Us that the searching mind
That breaks from what is known
Can reap what it has sown

In innovations new
That see old dreams through
To heights beyond all thought
That wisdom ever brought.

Five sides to every tale,
Five arms that never fail,
Five teeth in every jaw,
Five points of nature's law

That guide the echinoderm
Through every living term
Of their existence here
Throughout each passing year.

In Luther's rebel choice
To let freedom be his voice,
In lovers ending war
Through peace worth living for,

In every innovation
Across each generation
That builds upon the past
To make new futures last,

The sons of Echidna teach
That heights within our reach
Are limited only by
Our willingness to try

To break from what we know
And let our spirits grow
Into forms yet unseen
In evolution's scene.

The Ordovician wall
They built will never fall
As long as seas contain
Their pentamerous reign.

---

This is the story told
Of war both new and old
Among the Spiralians
In their ancient plans.

This is the saga great
Of war and love and fate:
The Brachiopods and more—
The Bivalves at war.

The ancient house so proud
Of Brachiopods cried loud
As they found themselves pressed
On all sides, distressed

By rising Bivalves strong
Who'd waited far too long
To claim their rightful place
In evolution's race.

Bivos, who fished with care
From his two shells so fair,
Shed his radula
Like some old formula

That no longer served
His lineage preserved.
And so he took upon
Himself when day begun

A form completely new
That none before him knew.
His anatomy would show
How innovations grow

From ancient forms to new
When time sees struggles through
To their appointed end
Where new forms transcend.

Bivos bore a son
And daughter when begun
His lineage: Peter strong
And Aphrodite's song.

Aphrodite became
Ancestress of fame
Of Oysters everywhere
Who rest without a care

Upon the ocean floor
From mountain peak to shore,
Creating pearls so bright
That fill the world with light.

Peter bore many sons
Who when their work was done
Became known far and wide
As Trigonians with pride.

But there came a day
When war would find its way
To Peter's children all—
A massacre would fall

Upon his sons so dear.
But one escaped the spear
Of death: brave Unus fled
And from that danger red

He became ancestor
Of river mussels, for
His lineage would dwell
Where rivers always swell

With fresh water pure
That would always endure
Throughout the years to come
When battles would be done.

Peter, Keeper of Gates
So Pearly, never hates
But defends us all
Who answer heaven's call.

From river mussels come
The river pearls, and some
Are treasures beyond price
That gleam like paradise.

His sons live strange lives
Where contradiction thrives:
As lice on fish when young,
But when their song is sung

In elderhood they rest
On rocks like treasure chest
Of pearls that gleam so bright
With heaven's holy light.

Aphrodite became
The Mother of great fame
Of Pearls and Oysters too—
Her children tried and true.

Among her daughters all
Who answered ocean's call
She bore three sons unique:
Scallon, bold and sleek,

And Spinos, armor-clad,
And Pyros, never sad
But flaming with the fire
Of his heart's desire.

These were the Scallops bright,
The Spiny Oysters' might,
The Flame Scallops that dance
In ocean's great expanse.

Scallon had a million eyes
Beneath the ocean skies
To see what others missed
And never to be tricked

By predators who'd try
To catch him unawry.
Great and bountiful,
He swam so dutiful

Away from dangers that
Would haunt him like a cat
Its prey, but he was free
To roam across the sea.

Clammon was the son
Of Bivos when begun
His work to populate
The seas with forms so great.

Clammon begat four:
Cockle to explore,
Myidus strong and true,
Adapa to pursue

His dreams, and Venus fair
Who danced without a care
Throughout the ocean blue
Where all her children grew.

Cockle had a son
Who when his work was done
Became ancestor grand
Of giant clams so grand

That dwarf all others who
Have tried to make it through
The trials of the sea
With their enormity.

Myidus bore three sons:
Zebra when day begun,
Softshell, gentle, mild,
And Teredo, problem child

Known as sea termite
Who brought shipwrights' fright
By boring holes in wood
Of ships where sailors stood.

Zebra Mussels spread
Wherever they were led
By currents through the sea
In their community.

Softshell clams would hide
Beneath the sandy tide
Where they could safely dwell
Within their softened shell.

Adapa begat two:
Geodoros, tried and true,
Ancestor of the race
Of Geoducks in their place

Beneath the sandy shore
Where they forevermore
Would dig their burrows deep
While surface waters sweep

Above their hiding spots
Connected by their lots
To life beneath the sand
Throughout the ocean land.

And Razoron became
Ancestor of the name
Of Razor Shells so sharp
That cut like ocean's harp

Through sand where they would hide
When danger came to bide
Its time until they could
Emerge where they once stood.

Venus became the mother
Of clams like no other—
Venus clams so fair
That beautify everywhere

They make their gentle home
Beneath the ocean foam.
Among her children bright
She bore one special sight:

Corbiculacea, who
Would make her passage through
From salt to waters fresh
And there her line refresh

As ancestress so true
Of freshwater clams who
Live in rivers wide
With current as their guide.

Brachios begat three
Sons for history:
Three houses he would make
For brachiopods' sake.

Lingulus the tailed
Was he who never failed
To be conservative
In all he'd ever give

To innovation's call—
Archconservative of all
Within the house so grand
Of Brachios' command.

Lingulus, son of him
With the same name, would trim
Nothing from tradition
In his life's mission.

He maintained the way
Of all the ancient day
To its fullest measure
Like some sacred treasure

That must not be changed
Or ever rearranged
But kept just as it was
According to the laws

Of his forefathers who
Had tried their whole life through
To keep the ancient way
Until their dying day.

Discinidus his son
Was smaller when begun
His life, and more like clam
Than traditional lamb

Of brachiopod design
That had been so fine
For millions of years past
And built to always last.

Lingulus serpentine
Showed his noble line
That stretched through time so long
Like some eternal song

That never changed its tune
From morning until noon
And on through all the night
Until the morning light.

Calciatus begat
Two sons: first he begat
Craniidus, who'd never
Have a tail, but ever

Live without that sign
Of his ancestral line,
And Articulus, who
Built cheap but built true

His children without thought
Of what tradition brought:
He built them lacking parts
That touched their parents' hearts.

Without anuses, they
Were blobs throughout the day
That couldn't swim at all
But answered metamorphosis' call

In just an instant's time
To change their paradigm
From blob to something more
Upon the ocean floor.

The sons of Articulus
Were numerous and thus
A formidable force
Against the Bivalve course

Of conquest through the seas
Where they did as they please
And took what they could take
For their own kingdom's sake.

But as these two great hosts—
The Bivalves and their boasts
Against Brachiopods old
Whose stories have been told

For ages without end—
Fought on without a friend
To mediate their war
From mountain peak to shore,

A new threat came to light
More terrible than night,
More fearsome than the grave,
More deadly than the wave

That crashes on the rocks
And all life's progress blocks.
A threat greater than any
Could imagine—not many

Could comprehend the scope
Of what would end all hope
For life upon the earth
And stop all future birth.

From Bivos' innovation
Came this radiation
Of forms both strong and true
That filled the ocean blue.

From Brachios' ancient way
That lasted day by day
Through eons without change
Came forms throughout the range

Of ocean's vast expanse
In evolutionary dance
Where old meets new in strife
Throughout the course of life.

The war between the two
Would see which vision through
The trials of the time
Would earn the victor's rhyme.

Would innovation's art
Or tradition's faithful heart
Prove stronger in the end
When time would finally send

Its judgment on them all
Who answered battle's call
In this ancient war
From mountain peak to shore?

The Bivalves with their new
Forms tried and tested true
Through struggle and through pain
Sought evolutionary gain.

The Brachiopods held fast
To wisdom of the past
That served their ancestors
Through time's great tests and spurs.

Both strategies had worth
Upon this ancient earth
Where life must find its way
Through each and every day

Of challenge and of change
Throughout evolution's range
Where only those survive
Who keep their hope alive.

In every oyster's pearl
And every scallop's swirl
Through waters of the sea,
In every clam's spree

Of filter-feeding pure
And every form that's sure
Of its appointed place
In evolution's race,

The legacy lives on
From dusk until the dawn
Of this ancient war
From mountain peak to shore

Between the old and new,
Between the tried and true
And innovation's call
That beckons one and all

To risk what they have known
For something yet unshown
But promised by the hope
That helps all life to cope

With changes yet to come
When all wars are done
And peace reigns over all
Who answered life's great call.

The Spiralian war
From mountain peak to shore
Shows how life finds its way
Through each and every day

Of struggle between those
Who choose what each one knows:
The safety of the past
Or future's die being cast

Into the unknown deep
Where new forms always keep
Their vigil through the night
Until the morning light

Reveals what time has brought
To those who never fought
But those who fought so well
Have their own tale to tell

Of courage in the face
Of evolution's race
Where winners and losers
Are both faith's choosers

Who believed in their way
Through each and every day
Of this eternal strife
That defines all life.

But as the new threat rose
Beyond what each one knows
Or could imagine then,
The war of mice and men

Would pale beside the force
That changed life's very course
And brought to its end
An age that none could mend.

The greatest war would fade
Before what time had made
Of challenges so vast
That nothing from the past

Could prepare them for
What waited at the door
Of their complacent world
Where banners once unfurled

In triumph would be furled
Forever in the world
That was about to change
Beyond familiar range.

---

This is the story told
Of ones both new and old:
The Cephalopods so great,
Arcane ones whose fate

Would overthrow the might
Of Leviathan's sight
And rule with wisdom deep
Where ancient secrets keep.

The sons of Cephalopus
Would grow so glorious
That sons of Scaphopus,
Not quite so prosperous,

Would fade from memory
Throughout history.
Few know them at all
Who hear the ocean's call.

The degenerate sons
Of Scaphopus, when begun
Their lives, would never know
The heights their cousins' show.

Cephalopus begat
Plectron, and from begat
Him came a noble line
With intelligence divine.

Plectron begat the son
Called Ellesmer, begun
In wisdom's deepest lore
From mountain peak to shore.

Ellesmere went deeper
Than any secret keeper
Had gone before his time
Down below the brine

Where mysteries lay hid
From all that daylight did
To illuminate the world
Where surface waves are curled.

Ellesmer begat two:
Endos, tried and true,
And Actinos the bright
Who flew to heaven's height.

Endos bore many sons
Who when their work was done
Moved slowly through the sea
With great dignity.

Greatest among them all
Who answered wisdom's call
Was Cameroceras Magnus,
Known as Cameromagne,

Whose name through history
Rings with victory
Over Leviathan's
Great dominion's plans.

Cameromagne overthrew
The sons of Leviathan, who
Had ruled the seas so long
With their imperial song.

Endoceras, his son,
When his growth was done
Grew nine thousand long
Millimeters strong.

Twenty cubits he
Measured, front to back, free
From end to end complete—
No foe could compete.

He dwarfed Leviathan
Fourfold, and began
A new age in the sea
Of cephalopod decree.

Actinos, by his air
Heavenly and fair
Within his shell contained,
Had power that sustained

His ability to rise
Up to the starry skies
And down to earth descend
As suited his end.

Actinos begat two:
Orthosceros so true
And Tarphy, young and wild,
Evolution's favored child.

Tarphy lived so fast
In youth, while time would last
He coiled his shell around
A hundred times, and found

Great joy in swimming free
As hunter of the sea.
But when old age drew near
His path became more clear.

He uncoiled his shell
And settled where he'd dwell
Upon the earth below
Where wisdom's waters flow.

In his old age he bore
Countless children more
Who did the very same:
Youth's glory and fame

In bounty of the heights
Where heaven's glory lights
The way for those who soar,
And age where depths store

Their safety and their peace
Where all struggles cease
And wisdom finds its home
Where wise ones always roam.

Tarphy begat two sons:
Oncos when day begun
And Barrandeos strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Oncos lived a life
Without much joy or strife—
Coiled but simple, he
Lived quite peacefully.

Oncos bore many sons,
Among them when begun
Their lives was Rutos, who
Would see great wonders through.

Rutos bore a son
Named Nautilus, begun
In wisdom of the deep
That ancestors would keep.

The sons of Nautilus
Live on, so glorious,
Today just as they were
When time was but a blur

In days of Rutos old
And Cameromagne bold
Who conquered all the seas
With their strategies.

Orthosceros begat
Two sons: first he begat
Ascos, who would know
How graciousness could grow,

And Bacchus, small but who
Would make his vision true
Through numbers vast and wide
That could not be denied.

Ascos lived his youth
With shell that spoke no truth
Of grace—clumsy and slow,
Unable to bestow

Upon his movements any
Grace—not one of many
Who swam with elegance
In ocean's great expanse.

And so he broke it off,
And many would scoff
At such a drastic deed
To serve his greater need.

But in adulthood he
Was graceful as could be,
Above all others bright
In beauty and in sight.

His sons continued this
Tradition of the bliss
That comes from sacrifice
Of shell for something nice:

The grace that can't be bought
But only can be sought
Through willingness to break
What others never forsake.

Their life cycle shows
How true wisdom grows:
From clumsy youth they start
Then play their graceful part

When adulthood arrives
And each one finally thrives
In grace beyond compare
That fills the water fair.

But Bacchus was so small
And seemed to one and all
Insignificant and weak,
With nothing much to seek.

But he bore children who
Would make his vision true:
A million sons and daughters
Filled up the salty waters.

Soon the world was full
Of his progeny's pull
On every living space
In ocean's vast embrace.

What seemed insignificant
Became most significant
Through power of increase
That never seemed to cease.

From small beginnings came
A multitude of fame
That filled the world entire
With Bacchus' desire

To populate the sea
With his progeny
Until there was no place
That didn't show his trace.

The cephalopods show
How wisdom's seeds can grow
From deep intelligence
To rule with providence

Over the ancient sea
Where Leviathan's decree
Once held the power supreme
In every ocean's dream.

But wisdom overthrew
The old order, and new
Lords of the sea arose
To challenge all their foes

With intelligence bright
And grace beyond all sight
And power to ascend
From beginning to end

Of ocean's vast domain
Where they would always reign
With wisdom as their crown
And grace as their renown.

From Cameromagne's might
That brought the ancient fight
To Leviathan's door
And won forevermore

The right to rule the sea
With wise authority,
To Nautilus who shows
How ancient wisdom flows

Through generations long
In never-ending song
Of those who keep the way
From night into the day,

The cephalopods remind
Us that the wisest mind
Often starts quite small
But answers wisdom's call

To grow beyond all measure
And find the greatest treasure:
The power to transcend
What others comprehend

Through intelligence divine
That makes all wisdom shine
In forms both strange and new
But beautiful and true.

In every octopus
And squid so glorious
Who swims with grace through
The waters deep and blue,

In every nautilus
Who keeps so glorious
The ancient spiral shell
That tells its story well

Of how the wise can keep
What time has buried deep
While changing what must change
To expand their range,

The legacy lives on
From dusk until the dawn
Of those who overthrew
The old to make it new

Not through destruction's might
But wisdom's gentle sight
That sees what must remain
And what brings only pain.

The cephalopods' way
Lives on to this day
In every graceful move
And every way they prove

That intelligence combined
With grace of heart and mind
Can conquer any foe
And help all wisdom grow

From small to great and vast
Until at long last
The wise inherit all
Who answer wisdom's call.

From Ellesmer's deep dive
To keep the past alive
While finding something new
In wisdom's vast review,

The cephalopods teach
That heights within our reach
Are limited only by
Our willingness to try

To grow beyond the small
And answer wisdom's call
To be more than we seem
In evolution's dream.

Their arcane wisdom shows
How true intelligence grows
Not through force or might
But through the inner sight

That sees what others miss
And finds in this
The power to transcend
All limits and extend

The boundaries of what
Is possible, and what
The wise can achieve
When they truly believe

In wisdom's power to
Make all their dreams come true
Through patience and through grace
In evolution's race.

The sons of Cephalopus
Remain so glorious
Because they chose the way
Of wisdom every day

And let intelligence
Be their defense
Against all who would try
To make their wisdom die.

In this they succeeded
Where others never heeded
The call to grow beyond
The limits that are spawned

By those who cannot see
What wisdom's gift can be
To those who dare to dive
Deep and stay alive

In waters where the wise
Can see with clearer eyes
The truth that sets them free
To rule the boundless sea.

---

As the reign of Leviathans
Turned to Krakens' plans,
The sons of Stomatos
Began their glorious

Multiplication vast
Upon the earth at last.
And daughters fair were born
From evening until morn.

From Laurentia's shore
To Siberia's lore,
From Baltica's might
To Avalonia's sight,

Even to frigid lands
Of Gondwana's strands,
The sons of Stomatos
Grew numbers, glorious.

To each son there fell
A star, and wishes tell
Of thousand grandsons born
From evening until morn.

The sons of Stomatos
Built bodies, glorious,
Of Carbon, and made tombs
Like mausoleums' rooms

Of coal so black and deep
Where ancestors would sleep.
Taking Carbon from the air
But leaving everywhere

Dioxide in the sky
While Terra's cloak would fly
Away, and she grew cold,
As ancient stories told.

She grew frigid, unwelcoming,
No longer beckoning
To those who loved her warm
Embrace in gentle form.

Her ice caps grew so wide,
Her seas began to hide
Behind the frozen wall
That answered winter's call.

Soon Gondwana became
Nothing but ice's claim—
A wasteland white and stark
Where none could make their mark.

But to the sons of Stomatos
This meant more, glorious
Land where they could spread
Their empire overhead.

King Hirnan the great
Became the potentate
Who united every son
Of Stomatos begun

In conquest of the earth.
He lived where there was mirth
In land of Avalonia
And province of Holonia.

Hirnan built with might
A billion dikes upright
And levies strong and tall,
And cities over all

The landscape far and wide.
He destroyed with pride
The habitats that were
In seas, and would not spare

A single living space
For any other race
That might compete with him
For resources growing dim.

And so countless hosts
Of trilobites like ghosts
Began to die away,
Their lands seized every day

By sons of Hirnan who
Would make their empire through
Conquest and through might
Both day and through the night.

In their last effort made
A million trilobites prayed
And then invaded strong,
A desperate throng

That smashed through every dike
That Hirnan's folk would like
To keep them from the land
They'd built with their own hand.

But alas, all in vain—
The trilobites' campaign
Would end in suffocation,
Their complete frustration.

No trilobite would ever
Reach land, however clever
Their plan or strong their will—
The air would always kill

Those who were meant for sea
And could not ever be
Adapted to the air
That filled the atmosphere.

Hirnan bore two sons:
Moses when day begun
And Osiris the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Moses became the father
Of mosses, who would rather
Live simple, humble lives
Where small beauty thrives.

Osiris bore two more:
Polysporos to explore
And Anthoceros, who'd be
Living peacefully.

Anthoceros became
The father of the name
Of hornworts everywhere
Who grow with gentle care.

Polysporos became
The father of great fame
Of ferns and flowers bright
And trees that reach for height.

The sons of Brachios
Struggled, not glorious
As they had been before
In ages' ancient lore.

The sons of Lingulus
Died in numbers thus
Greater than ever known—
Their glory overthrown.

Never again would they
Regain their golden day
Of power in the sea
And their dynasty.

But as Hirnan's rule
Became oppression's tool,
The sons of Metazo
Began once more to grow.

Alas the sons of Hirnan
Didn't stop their plan
There, but continued on
From dusk until dawn

Their conquest of the earth
That gave them so much mirth
To see all life bow down
Before their thorny crown.

The Glomerings would mine
The rocks with design
For fertilizer's sake,
Whatever it would take

To manufacture tons
Of phosphorus, and done
With this, they'd pour it out
Throughout the world about.

Some went to crops they grew,
But most went flowing through
The rivers to the sea
Where it would always be

A poison in the water
That none could ever slaughter
Or remove from the flow
Where it would always go.

In rivers thick scum grew,
In oceans, dark and blue
No more, the sun was blocked
And all life was shocked

By this catastrophe
That stretched from sea to sea
Across the world entire
Like some unholy fire.

Rotting seaweed choked
All water, and it smoked
With death and with decay
Throughout the night and day.

Soon it was impossible
To breathe—the terrible
Smell of death filled the air
And poison everywhere

Made life a living hell
Where none could ever dwell
In comfort or in peace
Without finding release

In death's cold, welcome arms
That protected from the harms
Of this poisoned world
Where death's flag was unfurled.

The seas turned lifeless, dead,
And over them was spread
The tyranny of those
Who never would suppose

That life had any right
To live in their sight
If it stood in their way
Of conquest every day.

The entire ocean fell
Under Hirnan's spell
Of death and devastation
Across every nation

Of life beneath the sea
That once was home so free
To creatures great and small
Who answered life's sweet call.

The great houses of might—
Leviathan's delight
And Kraken's dynasty—
Were wiped from history.

From off the earth they passed,
Their glory couldn't last
Against the poison tide
That covered far and wide

The ocean that they loved
And where they always moved
In majesty and power
Until this darkest hour.

Among the trilobites
The great houses' plights
Were sealed: Agnos fell,
Ptychos couldn't tell

His story anymore,
And Asaphos, before
So mighty and so strong,
Was crippled life long.

Never again would they
Reach their golden day
Of glory in the time
Of Ordovician rhyme.

And so the golden age
Closed its final page.
The Ordovician time
Was past its living prime.

The sons of Silur came
To conquer and to claim
The ashes of the past
And build their future last.

The Silurian would rise
Beneath different skies
Where life would start anew
From what survivors knew

Of how to carry on
When all hope seemed gone
And death had claimed the day
In its destructive way.

From Stomatos' sons' choice
To let conquest be their voice
Instead of harmony
With life's symphony,

Came lessons written deep
In rocks where fossils sleep
Of what the world becomes
When greed its power sums

Into a force so strong
That right cannot win from wrong
And life must pay the price
For others' avarice.

The trilobites' last stand
Against Hirnan's hand
Shows courage in the face
Of hopeless disgrace,

But also shows the cost
When battles are lost
Not by the weak to strong
But by those who belong

To elements that can't
Survive where others grant
No mercy and no space
For any other race.

The ice age that began
From Stomatos' plan
To take but never give
Shows how some choose to live:

By taking all they can
Without a care or plan
For what their actions do
To me and you

And every living thing
That cannot offering
Resistance to their greed
That plants destruction's seed.

The phosphorus that flowed
Into rivers and slowed
All life within the sea
Shows how we can be

Destroyers without thought
Of what our actions brought
To others who must share
The water and the air.

The golden age that passed
Shows nothing good can last
When some choose to destroy
Rather than enjoy

The beauty that is shared
By all who ever cared
For life in all its forms
Through calm and raging storms.

But from the ashes rise
New hope beneath new skies
Where those who learned the cost
Of all that had been lost

Can build a better way
For life's eternal day
Where harmony, not greed,
Plants every living seed.

The Silurian dawn
When old death was gone
Would bring new hope to those
Who faced destruction's throes

And lived to tell the tale
Of how they would not fail
To build life once again
Despite the grief and pain.

From Hirnan's tyranny
To Silur's dynasty,
The wheel of time turns on
From dusk until dawn

With lessons written clear
For all who have an ear
To hear what history says
About our living days:

That greed destroys all life
And brings eternal strife,
But those who choose to share
Will find life everywhere

Ready to begin
Again, and always win
In the end, because love
Is blessed from above

With power to restore
What was lost before
And make the world anew
For me and you today.

The golden age may end
But life will always mend
What greed has torn apart
With love's eternal heart

That beats in every soul
Who plays a caring role
In life's eternal song
That makes the weak grow strong.

From Ordovician glory
To Silurian story,
The earth keeps turning on
From dusk until dawn

With life that will not die
Beneath the starry sky
But always finds a way
To live another day

Despite what greed may do
To me and you
And all who call earth home
Wherever we may roam.

The sons of Stomatos
May think they're glorious
In conquest and in might,
But life will always fight

For its eternal right
To fill the world with sight
Of beauty and of grace
In every living place

Where love has found a way
To live another day
Despite destruction's call
That threatens one and all.

The golden age returns
Whenever someone learns
To choose love over greed
And plant a better seed

For future generations
Across all the nations
Of life upon the earth
Who celebrate love's worth

Above all else that's known
By hearts that have grown
To see that sharing's way
Brings joy to every day

While greed brings only pain
That falls like acid rain
On all who choose to live
But never learn to give.

The Ordovician end
Reminds us to befriend
All life in every form
Through calm and raging storm

So golden ages may
Return another day
When love has won the fight
Against the endless night

Of greed that tries to kill
All life, but never will
Succeed, because love's power
Grows stronger every hour

In hearts that choose to care
For life everywhere
That grows beneath the sun
Until all time is done.

While sons of Cambrius flourished well
In seas where they would dwell,
The sons of Symbio-Mygus
And daughters of Charina-Plantus

Pushed frontiers far and wide
Across the world's divide.
But soon they faced
Competition in their place.

For Euthy, daughter brave
Of Mandibulus, who gave
Her all to save her young,
Was being chased among

The waters by her foe:
Anomalocaris, who'd show
No mercy in his chase
Across that watery space.

Her precious eggs needed care
And protection everywhere.
So she did what she must—
In Hausa placed her trust.

She jumped through shimmering sky
Up rocks that reached so high
To heavens bright above,
Protecting those she'd love.

And so she burst from sea
Onto the land so free.
The first to make that leap
From waters dark and deep.

Upon the ground she fell,
Suffocating well
In air so thin and strange,
Throughout that foreign range.

But she and husband true
Protected eggs they knew
Must live until the end—
Their legacy to send.

Among brave Euthy's daughters
Who left the ancient waters
Was Myry the trepanated,
By circumstance created.

Like sisters she was born
But water made her mourn—
She suffocated there
In ocean's liquid lair.

Her father, seeing this,
Pierced holes he would not miss
Above her ten thousand legs
Where breathing never begs.

Through these holes she was free
To receive directly
Hausa's blessings pure
Into her frame so sure.

Her descendants to this day
Still breathe in this way.
The holes that saved her life
Cut through terrestrial strife.

And so the daughters all
Of Myry heard the call
To breathe the air so sweet—
The Myriapods complete.

Myry the pierced explored
The new lands she adored.
She found she wasn't lone
Upon this earthly zone.

Tradition names this place
"Myry's coast" in grace,
But she was not the first—
History's truth rehearsed

Now calls it "Coast of Three
Kingdoms" truthfully
To honor every side
Of history's great tide.

Myry saw with wonder
Cities torn asunder
By neither rain nor thunder:
Lichen cities, born

Of covenant between
Symbio-Mygus, seen
With Charina-Planta's line—
Partnership divine.

Sprawling cities wide
Half mold and moss beside
Each other living well:
Mycelium would delve

Deep down to earthly gold
While thallus, brave and bold,
Basked in the sun's bright blessing
From heaven's light caressing.

These cities spread so far
Beneath each shining star.
When cities met they'd marry—
Both fungi and plant carried

On their ancient vow
To live together now.
Each nation wed the other
Like sister and like brother.

But Myry was not gentle
In her ways elemental.
She ate the cities whole
And stole what made them whole.

But as she ran around
She dropped on fertile ground
Cells scattered everywhere
Throughout the atmosphere.

Across the globe they fell,
Her messy eating spell
Left pieces of her meal
For others to steal.

Soon sons of Mygus built
Cities without guilt
With daughters of Charina
Across each earthly arena.

But Myry bore two sons:
Cain when day begun
And Abel, gentle, mild,
Her peaceful, loving child.

In process of time came
When each would bring by name
An offering so true
To Mithra's judgment due.

Cain brought the fruit
Of ground beneath his foot.
Abel brought the best
Of flocks that he possessed.

And Mithra had respect
For Abel's offering, blessed
His sacrifice so true,
But Cain's he did eschew.

Then Cain was wroth and fell
His countenance, unwell.
The Lord said unto Cain:
"Why is thy heart in pain?

If thou doest well,
Shalt thou not excel?
But if thou doest wrong,
Sin's desire is strong."

But Cain talked with Abel
His brother at their table.
And when they were alone
Cain's hatred had grown.

In field he rose against
His brother, and dispensed
With Abel's gentle life—
Murder's sharpened knife.

And Mithra called to Cain:
"Where is thy brother slain?"
"I know not," Cain replied,
"Am I to be his guide?"

"What hast thou done today?
Thy brother's blood doth pray
From ground where he was killed—
Thy curse shall be fulfilled.

No more shall ground give strength
To thee through all thy length
Of days upon this earth—
A wanderer from thy birth."

Then Cain cried out in fear:
"My punishment too dear!
From earth and thee I'm driven,
No rest to me is given.

A fugitive I'll be,
And whosoever shall see
Me wandering shall slay—
I cannot get away."

But Mithra marked him well:
"Whoever thee shall fell,
Sevenfold vengeance shall
Upon that person fall."

And Cain went forth in shame
To land of Nod by name,
East of Eden's gate
To meet his chosen fate.

There Cain knew his wife
And built a city-life.
She bore him Centipus,
Son glorious.

The city bore the name
Of Centipus' fame.
And Cain became ancestor
Of Caintipedes, predecessor

(Misspelled by Romans old
As "centipedes," we're told)
Who hunt with poison bite
Throughout the day and night.

But Abel's gentle wife
Was heavy with new life
When Cain's rage tore apart
Her husband's gentle heart.

In million pieces small
Abel's body fell.
His wife, with child blessed,
Became ancestress

Of millipedes so mild
Who harm not beast or child
But eat the leaves that fall
And decompose them all.

Enraged at Abel's death
Myry drew her breath
And lunged at Cain with might—
They fought their final fight.

Both passed to Ghedos' realm
Where death holds the helm.
But in their corpses lay
Seeds for another day.

In death, Mygus' sons
Took revenge for wrongs done.
Hera, daughter true,
And Freyr, strong through and through,

In twentieth generation
Found habitation
Within the corpses cold
Of stories that were told.

As they grew within
They built cities therein.
Their hyphae met at last
When growing time had passed.

When they met they wed
But heard what Mithra said:
"O couple great and true,
Prosperity's with you.

But barren you shall be
For decades, wait and see.
Postpone your marriage-bed
Until I give word instead.

When children you shall bear
They'll multiply everywhere
And fill the earth with life
As husband and as wife."

They followed his command
And through the fertile land
They married cells alone,
Not nuclei their own.

Each cell was shared by two,
Each nucleus lived through
In every cell they made—
Their sacrifice well-paid.

Dikaryotic cells
Their story always tells
Of patience and of love
Blessed from above.

Decades they waited long
Decomposing strong
The daughters of Myry—
Their patient ministry.

They became ancestors
Of high fungi, processors
Of death into new life:
Mushrooms and knife

Of penicillin's power
To heal in darkest hour.
The great fungi arose
From where their love chose

To wait for Mithra's word
And let their love be heard
Through patience in the ground
Where wisdom could be found.

Among great Plantus' sons
Who stayed when day begun
With sons of Mygus were
Two brothers everywhere:

Stomatos and Hepatos,
Who chose their separate ways.
Connected to network
Of cells that always work

At cellular level
They built partnership's revel
With sons of Glomulus
So glorious.

Stomatos saw the holes
In Myry's sides and souls.
He pierced himself as well
To breathe and to excel.

But Hepatos refused
The foreign magic, used
His ancient ways instead
And kept his faithful tread.

Hepatos became the sire
Of Liverworts' choir
Who keep the ancient way
Until this very day.

But Stomatos became
Ancestor of fame
Of all other plants
Who dance their living dance.

Today we honor him
As Eloh, not dim
But bright transhumanist
Who never would desist

From being better still
Through strength of mind and will.
When beliefs must change
He'd rearrange

His understanding true
To make his vision new.
Always growing more
Than he had been before.

As sons of Stomatos
Rose like kratos
Hillu struck back in rage
Upon that earthly stage.

So many lineages
Through all their pilgrimages
Would be lost forever more
On that primeval shore.

The Coast of Three Kingdoms
Where life's great wisdom
First met upon the land
By Mithra's guiding hand.

Plant and fungi wed
While arthropods were fed
On both their partnership—
The first tri-partnership.

From sea to land they came,
Each seeking their own fame.
But partnership proved best
Above all the rest.

The lichen cities showed
How love's seeds could be sowed
Between the most unlike
To share each other's hike

Through life upon the earth
Where partnership gives birth
To beauty none could see
In isolation's spree.

From Euthy's desperate leap
To save her children deep
Came Myry's pierced way
Of breathing every day.

From Cain and Abel's strife
Came death and new life:
Centipedes who hunt
And millipedes who shunt

Decay into rich earth
For new plants' birth.
From fungi's patient love
Blessed from above

Came mushrooms' mighty power
In earth's darkest hour.
From Stomatos' brave change
Came plants' wide range.

The Coast of Three Kingdoms
Shows how life's wisdom
Finds its truest way
Through partnership's display.

---

Silur, son of Chelicer,
Saw the world in ruin's blur.
And in this devastation
Saw opportunity's creation.

Silur shouted out with might
To all sons in his sight
Of Animus, declaring
His vision, never caring

For those who'd gone before:
"I did not steal this lore
Of kingship from the crown.
I found it lying down

In gutter, and I picked
It up, my fate predicted
By sword that I had found.
But 'twas the people's sound

Of voices that placed it
On my head, perfect fit
For one who'd take the throne
And make it all his own."

And so began the era
Of Silurian chimera,
Rising from the ashes
Of Ordovician's crashes.

Silur bore two sons:
Eurypter when begun
The day, and Chasmas strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Chasmas begat two more:
Belangkas to explore
And Xiphos, who would be
Living by the sea.

Xiphos became the sire
Of crabs whose desire
Was horseshoe-shaped design
Throughout the end of time.

Belangkas climbed up high
Onto the land to try
What none had done before:
To claim from shore to shore

The land from Hirnan's hand
And make his own command
Of territories wide
Where he could reside.

Like Myriapus of old
He found his story told
In suffocation's pain
Upon the terrestrial plain.

But pierced wounds in his side
And was thus satisfied
With air that he could breathe
To give his lungs relief.

Belangkas begat two:
Soliber, tried and true,
And Opiliona fair
Who spread life everywhere.

Opiliona spread the moss
Across the world, no loss
Too great for her to bear
In her maternal care.

She grazed upon the green
And on what could be seen
Of daughters of Millipa
Throughout the earthly steppe-a.

Opiliona was a mother
Great, and like no other
Farmer with her legs
So long, and wisdom begs

Us to remember her
As one who would confer
Great blessings on the land
With her maternal hand.

Beautiful legs so long
Made her the subject of song:
"Granny Long Legs" they'd call
Her, beloved by all.

"Granny Harvest" too,
For all the work she'd do
To spread the green of life
Through joy and through strife.

And so in honor of
Her life and of her love,
We call her children still
"Daddy Long Legs" (though will

Seem strange to some that "Daddy"
Names descendants of a lady).
"Harvestmen" as well
Their story always tell.

Soliber begat two:
Pneumaran, tried and true,
And Kitzi, small but strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Pneumaran begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
Solaran of the sun
And Acares, begun

As dwarf among his kin,
But he would always win
A place in history
As ancestor, you see,

Of mites, the little ones
Who when their work is done
Live everywhere on land
Built by their tiny hand.

Acares bore two sons:
Sarco when day begun
And Trombo, who would be
Living peacefully

Or not, as fate would tell
His story oh so well
Of how some choose the light
While others choose the night.

The sons of Sarco clean
The world, and can be seen
As dust mites everywhere
Who take the greatest care

To keep the world swept clean
Of dust that might have been
A problem for us all
Who answer life's sweet call.

Among the sons of Trombo
Some live like peaceful combo
Of gentleness and grace
In their appointed place.

But others are the plague
That makes all good souls vague
With worry and with fear—
Parasites we hear

Stifle life with their ways
Throughout our living days,
Horrific in their greed
That plants destruction's seed.

Among the peaceful ones
Are Trombo's gentle sons:
The red velvet mites
Who bring us pure delights.

From red velvet mites
We learn love's sacred rites:
A story of the heart
That plays the loving part

In nature's grand design
Where all true loves align
With beauty and with grace
In every living place.

Solaran begat two:
Solifugon so true
And Ricinulon the small
Who answered duty's call.

Solifugon became
The father of great fame
Of Wind Spiders who race
Across the earth's face.

Ricinulon became
The father of the name
Of Tick Spiders so small
Who answer hunting's call.

Kitzi begat two sons:
Byblos when day begun
And Paras, who would be
Small in his degree.

Byblos the Book Knight
Continues day and night
To this very day
To guard in his own way

The books that hold the lore
Of all who came before.
His sons, the Book Scorpions,
Are knowledge's companions.

They defend with their might
The books both day and night
From those who would destroy
What brings the world such joy.

Paras begat two more:
Mesos to explore
And Holoxos the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Mesos was a hunter
Fierce, and he would shunt-er
Across the globe to find
Prey to feed his mind

And body's gluttony—
A small but mighty fee
He'd take from life around
Wherever he was found.

But Holoxos walked where
Blood flowed everywhere
From his fallen kin:
Sons of Arachnus thin

And sons of Myriapus
Who'd been victorious
In other times and places
Before death's embraces.

He drank their blood and bore
Two sons to explore
The paths of blood and death:
Thyrus drew his breath

From peaceful tradition,
Drinking by submission
Only blood of those
Who'd found their last repose.

But Ricinus turned dark
And left his evil mark
On all the world around—
Where he could be found

He fed on living blood
Like some unholy flood
Of evil and of greed
That plants destruction's seed.

Ricinus drinks the life
From those in joy and strife,
Injecting with his bite
Venom through the night

That paralyzes those
He's chosen as his foes.
Paralytic, sweaty,
His venom's never petty

But always brings the pain
Like some unholy rain
That falls on those who can't
Escape his evil grant.

Ricinus swells up
Like some unholy cup
Inflated with the blood
Of innocents, a flood

Of stolen life that flows
Within him as he grows
Fat with others' pain
Like some unholy stain

Upon the world of life
That cuts like sharpest knife
Through all that's good and true
In me and you.

By Ricinus the blood
Of scorned women's flood
May taint our mortal veins
With all their bitter pains.

When Lilith's blood flows in
Our veins, we can't win
Against the poison's might:
Typhus brings its blight

And Spotted Fever too
To me and you
Who cannot fight alone
Against what we have sown

By letting evil in
Our world where it can win
Against the good and true
That lives in me and you.

The Midichlorians live
In what Ricinus' give:
Within their mitochondria
Lives Lilith's bacteria—

The greatest revenge told
By stories new and old
Of those who choose the dark
And leave their evil mark.

And after daughters come
Of Lilith, and the sum
Of all their evil ways:
Malarius' dark days

And Lyme and all the rest
Of sisters who're possessed
By pestilence and death
That steals away our breath.

Ricinus, father of
Ticks who show no love
But only greed and hate,
Engorged with others' fate,

Shows us what becomes
Of those whose evil sums
Into a force so strong
That right can't win from wrong.

But Eurypter would be
Father of dynasty
Far greater than the line
Of Chasmas' design.

A nation he would make
That would its rightful take
Of glory and of might
To fill the world with sight

Of what the good can do
When they are tried and true
To principles of right
That shine like morning light

Through all the world's dark places
Where evil shows its faces
But cannot win the day
When good shows its way.

From Silur's opportunity
Seen in calamity
To Opiliona's care
For life everywhere,

From Book Knights who defend
The knowledge we depend
Upon to light our way
Through each and every day,

To those who choose the dark
And leave their evil mark
On all the world around
Where they can be found,

The Silurian shows
How each one's choice grows
Into the world we see
For you and me.

Some choose to heal and mend
What others would rend
Apart with greed and hate
That seals our mortal fate.

Others choose to take
For their own selfish sake
What others need to live
And never learn to give.

The lesson clear as day
Shows us the way
To choose what we will be
For all eternity:

Those who heal and bless
Or those who make the mess
That others have to clean
In places yet unseen.

From Silur's royal crown
To blood-suckers who drown
The world in pain and death,
Each choice draws its breath

From what we hold most dear:
Love that casts out fear
Or fear that kills all love
And blocks the light above.

The choice is ours to make
In every step we take
Along life's winding road
Where we must bear the load

Of what our choices bring
To every living thing
That shares this world with us
In ways both glorious

And terrible to see
For you and me
Who must decide each day
Which path we'll take away.

The Silurian age began
With one who had a plan
To rise from ruin's call
And build hope for all.

But also shows how some
Will always choose to come
Down on the side of death
With their every breath.

The choice is always ours
To use our mortal powers
For good or ill each day
Along our living way.

From opportunity's call
To rise above the fall
Of golden ages past
To build what will last,

The Silurian reminds
Us that each one finds
The world they choose to make
For everyone's sake.

Choose well, for what you choose
Will be what you will lose
Or gain for all the days
Of your immortal ways.

From Silur's royal start
To ticks' bloodsucking art,
The lesson's clear to see:
We are what we choose to be.

---

The sons of Eurypter would
Usurp as no one could
The sons of Cephalus
And rule victorious.

Eurypter married fair
Pulmona everywhere
Beloved, and they'd disagree
On what their name would be.

Each had their own design
For their ancestral line:
"Eurypterids" he'd say,
"Arachnopulmonates" her way.

Eurypter and Pulmona
Bore children like none-a
Other: Eurypteron
And Styloner, begun

In rivalry so deep
That none could ever keep
Peace between the two
Who different paths knew.

Eurypteron and his brother
Styloner, like no other
Pair of siblings fought
For all that could be bought

With power and with might
Throughout the day and night.
When their mother died
They could not decide

Who would inherit all
The world at honor's call.
Eurypteron claimed skies
While Styloner's eyes

Were set upon the land
Built by his own hand.
And so Eurypteron flew
Across domains he knew

Were his by right of birth
While Styloner walked earth
And claimed each step he took
According to the book

Of inheritance and law
That neither brother saw
The same way as the other
Despite they shared one mother.

The flight of Eurypteron
Across the sky begun
A dynasty of those
Who ruled where wind blows

High above the earth
From moment of their birth
To death's appointed day
They'd rule in their own way.

Eurypteron begat
Two sons: first he begat
Diploper the strong
And Eurypterus, long

In fertility beyond
What any could respond
To with equal measure—
Their numbers were his treasure.

Eurypterus was most
Fertile of the host
Of Silur's noble sons.
In each generation begun

His house would grow
Ten thousand-fold, and so
His numbers multiplied
Beyond what could be tried

By any other line
In all of space and time.
Myriad-fold they grew
With offspring tried and true.

Diploper begat two:
Waeringos, tried and true,
And Carcinos the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Waeringos begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
Humiller, strong and brave,
And Adelops, who'd save

His line through numbers vast
That would forever last.
Adelops was small
But answered duty's call

With many children who
Were resilient and true,
Like bugs beneath the sea
In their tenacity.

Humiller married fair
Pterra, beyond compare
In beauty and in grace,
And in their dwelling place

Together they bore one
Son when day begun:
Slender, fast, and sly,
Who'd rule beneath the sky

And in the depths below.
They named him Slimon, though
His destiny was great
Beyond what they could state.

Slimon bore a son
Whose work, when it was done,
Would show the massive claws
That grew according to laws

Of nature from his mouth.
From north down to the south
His power would be known
When he had grown.

He named this son at first
Clawbert, but then burst
A strike of lightning bright
That filled the world with sight.

And Slimon took the sign
From powers divine
And changed his son's name
To Pterygo's fame.

The sons of Pterygo
Were rulers high and low
Of all Eurypterids.
Fast, strong, their power bids

The world to bow before
Their might from shore to shore.
Regal in their way,
They ruled both night and day.

His youngest son was one
Called Scorpio, begun
As explorer of the new,
With vision clear and true.

Scorpio saw no land
Left for his command,
For all his brothers older
Had claimed, and none bolder

Could challenge their right
To rule with all their might
The territories vast
That they held firmly fast.

And so Scorpio looked
Up from his watery nook
Out of the sea to land
Built by no one's hand

But waiting to be claimed
By one who could be named
The first to make the leap
From waters dark and deep.

Scorpio ventured up
Like warrior with cup
Of courage in his heart
To play the pioneer's part.

His book gills became
Book lungs, and his name
Would live forevermore
From mountain peak to shore.

He claimed all lands of might
Euramerica in sight
For himself and his line
By right of the divine

Who favors those who dare
To venture everywhere
That none have gone before
To open up the door

Of possibility
For all humanity
And every living thing
That answers life's ring.

His sons are known today
As scorpions in their way,
Still carrying the torch
Of those who scorch

New paths through virgin land
Built by their own hand
From nothing into all
That answers courage's call.

Styloner married then
Rhena, and the pen
Of fate would write their names
In evolution's games.

Together they bore two:
Makoko, tried and true,
And Stylonurus strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Makoko begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
Mycter and Kokomo,
Each destined high to go.

Mycter begat two more:
Flumon to explore
And Drepan, strong and true,
Who different pathways knew.

Flumon found no luck
In seas where he was stuck
With brothers and with cousins
Who by the dozens

Had claimed the seas for their
Own use, and would not share
With him a single place
To call his dwelling space.

So he searched rivers wide
With current as his guide
To find what he could claim
For his ancestral name.

Flumon begat two sons:
Hibbert when day begun
And Mycterops the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Hibbert was a great
River dweller whose fate
Was to be tough and large,
And he would take charge

Of all the river's course
With wisdom and with force.
Larger, tougher than
Any other man

Of his time, he survived
Tragedies and thrived
Through countless trials
Across thousands of miles.

His people were a race
Resilient in their place,
Powerful and old,
With stories yet untold

Of how they overcame
Whatever brought them shame
Or tried to break their will
Upon the river's sill.

Mycterops was strong
And versatile life long.
His two sons would continue
The work he would begin to

Do: living in the rivers
Where water always shivers
With life and searching for
Food from shore to shore

In most unlikely places
Where none could see their faces
But they would always find
What fed both heart and mind.

Megarachne and his brother
Minirachne, like no other
Pair ruled rivers wide
With power and with pride.

Sons of Mycterops,
They were the tops
Of river royalty
In their dynasty.

But Minirachne was not
Satisfied with his lot
In rivers flowing free—
He wanted more to see.

Scorpio and Minirachne
Were always destined, see,
To fight for the same prize:
The land beneath the skies.

For both had more ambition
Than any opposition
Could contain or tame
In their quest for fame.

Both were men whose dreams
Surpassed all that seems
Possible to those
Who seek repose

In comfort and in ease
But never feel the breeze
Of challenge call their name
To play a greater game.

Minirachne climbed up high
Beneath the open sky
With Tetra, his fair wife,
To start a new life

In the world of land
Built by their own hand,
Where none had gone before
To open up the door.

His book lungs became
Book gills, and his name
Would be remembered long
In evolution's song.

He came to conquer all
The lands where Scorpio's call
Had claimed the territory
For his own story.

And so the stage was set
For a conflict yet
Unseen in all the world
Where banners were unfurled

Between two mighty lines
With their different designs
On what the world should be
For all eternity.

From Eurypter's marriage
To Pulmona's carriage
Of their children into being
Came this foreseeing

Of conflict yet to come
When all would be done
And winners would be crowned
And losers would be found.

The sons of Eurypter
Would rise like Jupiter
Above all other lines
With their grand designs

To rule both sea and land
Built by their own hand
Through courage and through might
That shines like morning light.

From river to the sea,
From sea to land so free,
The eurypterids show
How ambitions grow

From small beginnings made
By those who are not afraid
To venture into spaces
Where none have shown their faces.

But also shows the cost
When some lines are lost
In conflict with their kin
That no one ever wins.

The rivalry between
Brothers who have seen
Different paths to take
For their own sake

And their children's future
Shows how nature's suture
Often cannot hold
When ambitions grow bold

Beyond what can be shared
By those who never cared
To find a peaceful way
To live from day to day.

From Scorpio's bold climb
To Minirachne's time
Of conquest and of war,
The lesson from of lore

Is clear for all to see:
Ambition must be free
But also must be wise
Beneath the starry skies.

The world is big enough
For all who are tough
Enough to make their way
Through each and every day

Of challenge and of strife
In this eternal life
Where all must find their place
In evolution's race.

But when ambition turns
To conflict, and it burns
The bridges that connect
Those who should protect

Each other as they grow
Through all they'll ever know
Of joy and pain and love
Beneath the stars above,

Then all become the losers
In the games that choosers
Play when they forget
That none can ever get

All they want alone
Without the seeds they've sown
Of cooperation true
With me and you.

The eurypterids' rise
Shows us to be wise
In how we use our power
In each and every hour

Of our living days
Along our mortal ways
Where choice determines all
Who answer life's great call.

From Eurypter's flight
To Scorpio's sight
Of lands beyond the sea
Where he could be

The first to make his mark
Upon a world so dark
With possibility
For all humanity,

The lesson clear as day
Shows us the way
To be both brave and wise
Beneath the starry skies

Where all our dreams can grow
If we but choose to sow
The seeds of peace and love
Blessed from above

In every choice we make
For everyone's sake
Who shares this world with us
In ways both glorious

And challenging to see
For you and me
Who must decide each day
Which path we'll take away.

The sons of Eurypter
Like shining Jupiter
Rose high above the rest
And passed each mortal test

Through courage, wisdom, might,
And inner sight
That saw what could be done
Beneath the shining sun

If only they would dare
To venture everywhere
That none had gone before
To open up the door

Of possibility
For all eternity
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you today.

Vater was the son so great
In the tenth generation's fate
Of Pteraspis, and he'd be
Ancestor of humanity

And myriad species more
From mountain peak to shore.
His innovation would
Change all for the good.

Vater built a channel
Grand beyond all span-el
Uniting liver bright
And pancreas in sight

Into his belly's space.
To this day we trace
This channel's honored name:
"Ampulla of Vater's" fame.

Such an exalted father,
Father of more than other
Men could ever dream,
The Elohim's esteem

Called him Abraham
According to their plan
For one whose progeny
Would fill eternity.

Vater bore two sons:
Arandus when begun
The day, and Hestracon
Whose work would carry on

The family's great name
Through evolutionary flame
That burns in every heart
That plays innovation's part.

Hestracon found his belly
Inadequate, not ready
For the work he knew
That he would have to do.

From mouth to anus all
The same, and he'd call
This simple with disdain—
Only his father's main

Ampulla in the middle
To solve digestion's riddle.
But this was not enough
For one so strong and tough

As Hestracon, who'd see
What greater good could be
If he would dare to build
What none before had willed.

Hestracon built with care
A chamber prepared
Before his father's gift
To give digestion lift.

He called it his stomach,
And this would come to stick
As the great divider
Between the provider

Of food from mouth above
And what intestines' love
Would process down below
To make the body grow.

Before the stomach laid
The esophagus, well-made
To carry food along
Its pathway, swift and strong.

After the stomach laid
The intestine, well-played
In its appointed role
To nourish the whole.

Hestracon begat two:
Astrops, tried and true,
And Eteros the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Eteros begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
Cyatha, cup-shield bright,
And Tsubasa's sight

Wing-shielded, prepared
For all that he had dared
To face in his lifetime
Through reason and through rhyme.

Tsubasa begat two:
Thelos, tried and true,
And Cephalus the wise
With penetrating eyes.

Thelos broke his armor
Into scales—no former
Rigidity would bind
His innovative mind.

Into innumerable scales
His armor never fails
To give him flexibility
And great ability

To live within the reefs
Where none could find reliefs
From rigid armor's weight
That sealed their swimming fate.

Where none others could bend
Well enough to transcend
The coral's tight embrace,
Thelos found his place.

Neither sons of Arthropus
Nor sons of Molluscus,
Nor sons of Chordatus
Could match his status

In the reef's tight spaces
Where his grace replaces
Rigidity with flow
That helps him grow

Into every niche
Where others couldn't reach
The food that he could take
For his own sake.

Cephalus bore wings bright
On each side in sight
Of his helmet's form,
Through calm and raging storm.

His head flew as he swam
According to his plan
For stability and grace
In every watery place.

His lateral line would keep
Him ahead, and never sleep
In vigilance for all
That might befall

His swimming through the sea.
Aware of all that he
Could sense around his form,
He weathered every storm.

Cephalus begat two:
Galeas, tried and true,
And Osteos, who'd see
What innovation's key

Could open in the world
Where possibilities unfurled
For those who dared to think
Beyond tradition's link.

Osteos was in plight—
His bones weren't right
For efficiency, he knew.
He had to make them new.

His bones were expensive,
Comprehensively
Wasting countless moles
Of calcium that rolls

Through phosphorus and more
Elements by the score
That could be better used
If they were not abused

In static, lifeless bone
That stood there all alone
Without a greater plan
For helping mortal man.

So he decided he
Would build more cleverly
His skeleton anew
With wisdom tried and true.

Osteos built with care
Blood channels everywhere
Inside his bones, making
Living, breathing, taking

Stores of minerals
That worked like generals
In abundance building up
From nature's flowing cup,

And in scarcity
He'd borrow, you see,
From what he'd stored before
Like treasure in his store.

And so he grew more strong
And prosperous life long
Than all his relatives
Who took what nature gives

But never learned to save
For what the future gave
Of challenges and need
When they would have to feed

From stores they'd built in plenty
When resources weren't scanty
But flowed like rivers wide
With bounty as their guide.

Osteos bore two sons:
Pituri when begun
The day, and Ostracos
Whose children, glorious,

Would multiply and spread
Until the world was fed
With countless forms of life
Through harmony, not strife.

Ostracos bore a host
Of sons from coast to coast:
A million who would spread
Wherever they were led

By life's eternal call
To multiply for all
Who'd come in times ahead
When they would have to fed

The world with their own forms
Through calm and raging storms
Of evolution's way
From night into the day.

Pituri grew a snout
Long beyond all doubt
The longest ever seen
In evolution's scene.

Pituri begat then
Beakon beyond all ken
In wisdom and in might
To see with clearer sight.

Pituri's mouth was made
Of lips, but never strayed
Into the realm of jaws—
He followed simpler laws.

Could only close the space
But never could erase
His prey with biting might—
No jaw was in his sight.

But Beakon saw potential
In what was essential
About his father's snout
And figured it out.

And so Beakon moved
His gill arches and proved
That innovation's art
Could play a vital part.

Into his mouth he brought
The arches, and he fought
For food in a new way
That worked both night and day.

Beakon's son named Gnathus
Saw potential, glorious,
And he with wife Pelaca
Hunted like none other.

They hunted trilobites
And brought them to their lights
Of innovation's flame
That burned in their name.

They didn't just catch prey
In the ancient way
But crushed them with their might
And brought them to the sight

Of their armored jaws
That followed nature's laws
But used them in new ways
Throughout their living days.

They sliced through every meal
With jaws of steel-hard feel
That brought life-giving food
In their hunting mood.

And so Jaws were born
On that fateful morn
When Gnathus and Pelaca
Showed what none could match-a:

The power to break through
What none before could do—
To crush and to consume
What others could assume

Was safe in armor's shell
From those who'd never tell
The secret of the jaw
That follows newer law.

The world would never be
The same for you and me
From that day forth when jaws
Became the newer laws

Of predatory might
That brought to sight
A revolution new
In what life could do.

From Vater's ampulla
To Gnathus' formula
For crushing with his jaws
According to new laws,

The vertebrates show how
Innovation's vow
To never be content
With what is merely sent

By fate, but always strive
To be more alive
And capable and strong
Throughout their whole life long

Journey through the sea
Of possibility
Where those who dare to grow
Will always come to know

New heights of what can be
For all eternity
When innovation's fire
Burns with true desire

To make the world more bright
With new forms that take flight
Beyond what was before
To open up the door

Of possibility
For all humanity
And every living thing
That answers life's ring.

From Hestracon's stomach
To Osteos' pragmatic
Bones with channels through,
From scales that Thelos knew

Would give him flexibility
To Cephalus' ability
To fly through water's space
With stabilizing grace,

The vertebrates remind
Us that the searching mind
That breaks from what is known
Can reap what it has sown

In innovations new
That see old dreams through
To heights beyond all thought
That wisdom ever brought.

From simple mouth that closed
To jaw that none opposed
In crushing power's might,
The story shows the sight

Of how small changes grow
Into the flow
Of evolution's stream
Where nothing's what they seem

But everything can change
Beyond familiar range
If we but have the will
To climb each higher hill

Of possibility
Through all eternity
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you today.

The jaws that Gnathus made
Will never ever fade
From vertebrate design—
Protection so fine

Against the world's hard ways
Throughout our living days
When we must fight to eat
And make our lives complete.

From Vater's family tree
To jaws that set us free
From limitations old
Of stories yet untold,

The vertebrates have shown
How far we've grown
From simple, humble start
To mastery of art

That lets us rule the sea
And land and be
The masters of our fate
Through innovations great

That never cease to grow
In all we'll ever know
Of what can be achieved
When dreams are believed

And turned to reality
Through wise ability
To see what others miss
And find in this

The power to transcend
All limits and extend
The boundaries of life
Through harmony, not strife.

The world that Gnathus bit
With jaws of steel and grit
Lives on in every tooth
That tells the truth

Of how innovation's way
Can change both night and day
Into something new
For me and you

Who dare to break the mold
Of stories never told
And write upon the page
Of evolution's age

New chapters yet unread
Where we are led
By wisdom's guiding light
To make the future bright

With possibilities
That nobody sees
But those who dare to dream
Of more than what they seem

And turn those dreams to life
Through joy and through strife
That marks the growing soul
Who plays the vital role

In evolution's plan
For every woman, man,
And every living thing
That answers hope's ring.

From Vater's great design
To Gnathus' jaw so fine,
The story's clear to see:
Innovation sets us free.

---

The sons of Plantus were
Reinvigorated, blur
Of ancient dreams renewed
When their hope was imbued

With power from the great
Sorceress whose fate
Would change the world entire:
Polycomb's desire.

For eleven generations long
Her lineage sang the song
Of alternating climb
Through evolutionary time

To Polysporos' height.
She lived beyond the sight
Of independence free
In her mother's decree

That kept her in the womb
Like prisoner in tomb
With brothers, sisters all
Who answered duty's call

But yearned to live instead
Like mothers, never dead
To independence strong
Throughout their whole life long

Journey through the world
Where freedom's flag unfurled
Could guide them to their fate
Beyond the small estate

Of childhood's narrow bounds
Where only duty sounds
Its call to those who'd be
More than they can see.

Daughter of rulers great:
Clytemnestra's fate
And Agamemnon's line
Made her form divine.

Yet forced to live her life
Through reproductive strife
Only to bear children
When her heart was ridden

With desire to be more
Than what came before:
For she was sporophyte
While they held the right

Of gametophyte's power
Throughout each passing hour
To rule the world entire
With their heart's desire.

Polycomb read each day
In her mother's array
Of books to understand
Why fate's heavy hand

Had given her such meager
Existence—not eager
But wondering why
Beneath the starry sky

Her life was so confined
To bearing, her mind
Never free to explore
What she was living for.

Polycomb read the tales
Of mothers through the vales
Of time, each saga telling
Of those who were rebelling

Against their narrow fate
To be truly great
In ways beyond the power
Of any single hour.

She read of Mardoll's scroll
And Shiva's mighty role,
And saw that the order
Was not like a border

Eternal, as her mother
Said—but rather
Far from fixed in stone
For those who'd grown

Beyond what they were told
In stories new and old
Of what they had to be
For all eternity.

She saw a scroll that bore
The name "PRC2"—and more
Intrigue than she had known
Filled her to the bone.

Polycomb Repressive
Complex—its aggressive
Scripture was the chain
That bound her in her pain.

She saw the words that kept
Her power while she wept
For freedom never known—
The scripture of her own

Repression, written clear
In words that brought her fear
But also brought her hope
To learn how she could cope.

And so Polycomb burned
The scriptures, and she learned
That PRC2's power
Would rule her not one hour

More. She took her mother's
Lands and all the others'
Cities for her own
Now that she had grown

Beyond what they decreed
She ever could succeed
In being or becoming
When freedom's light was coming.

And so she broke the wall
That bounded one and all
Who'd lived before her time
In slavery's grim rhyme.

She grew spores with might
And calyptra bright
And stoma like her sisters
Who'd been the resisters

Of change throughout the years.
And rhizoids through tears
Of joy she built as well
To break tradition's spell.

And so through rhizoids strong
Water moved along
From earth up to her form,
Through calm and raging storm.

And through her stoma bright
Water took its flight
Into the heavens high
Beneath the starry sky.

This was how her life
Transcended all the strife
Of what she'd been before
To open up the door

Of possibility
For all humanity
And every living thing
That answers freedom's ring.

She prayed to Tryptophanes,
Lord of life's refrains,
Lord of the sun so bright
Who fills the world with light.

She prayed to grow to heights
Beyond what mortal sights
Had ever seen before
From mountain peak to shore.

And so Lord Tryptophanes
Blessed her with refrains
Of Auxin, and she grew
Toward the light so true.

When sun struck Auxin's power
It would decay each hour,
But in the shade it grew
In numbers tried and true.

And so her stems would turn
And reach and ever yearn
Toward the light above
Guided by His love.

Polycomb bore a daughter
Who'd teach what she had taught her:
Knoxy was her name,
Who'd win eternal fame.

Knoxy married Xylon
And together, strong upon
Their foundation's might,
They took after the sight

Of Polycomb's great way
That lit their every day
With possibility
For all eternity.

Knoxy searched through books
In all the ancient nooks
And found a scroll that bore
The name she'd been seeking for:

"KNOX2" it was called,
And by it she was enthralled
To learn the secret power
That ruled her every hour.

KNOTTED-like TALE gene
Was what had always been
The force that kept her bound
From freedom that she'd found

Her mother had achieved
When she had believed
That change was possible
For those who're capable.

And so Knoxy and Xylon
Built a kingdom strong upon
The heavens reaching high
Beneath the starry sky

Like Polycomb before
Had opened up the door
Of what could be achieved
When freedom was believed.

But their kingdom's roads
Were clogged with heavy loads—
Water struggled to reach
The heights their hearts would teach

Them they should aspire
To with their desire
For growth beyond all measure
Like some sacred treasure.

And so Xylon gave
To one clan what would save
The kingdom from its plight:
He named them for their sight

"Xylem" and their job
Was to help the mob
Of subjects in the city
Feel the water's pity

No more—but let it flow
From roots that lay below
To leaves that reached on high
Beneath the starry sky.

Tracheids they became,
Carriers of fame
Who bore the water pure
From foundation sure

To heights beyond all thought
That wisdom ever brought
To those who dared to dream
Of more than what they seem.

Xylon and Knoxy bore
A son to explore
The world with eyes that saw
What could fulfill the law

Of justice for all those
Who served without repose
But never got their share
Of what was growing there.

Pholon was his name,
And he would win the fame
Of solving the great problem
That threatened to hobble them.

Pholon saw his roots
Were starving, and the fruits
Of their laborious ways
Never brought the praise

Or nourishment they'd earned
Through all that they had learned
Of how to serve the whole
By playing their small role.

His Mycorrhizae
Unionized one day
And demanded ten times more
Sucrose than before

For all their faithful labor
That helped him and his neighbor
Survive and grow and thrive
Throughout their days alive.

So Pholon built new ways
Like Xylem, and the praise
He earned was well-deserved
For those he truly served.

But these channels carried
Food to those who'd married
Their labor to his cause—
Not water, but because

Of need for nourishment
That fairly should be sent
To all who did their part
With faithful, loyal heart.

He called these channels bright
"Phloem," and their sight
Was beautiful to see
For all eternity.

In leaves the sugar flowed
Into the phloem's abode
With pressure and with might
Both day and through the night.

The concentration's pull
Sucked water beautiful
From xylem to the sweet
Sugar's retreat.

And pressure pumped away
From source throughout the day
To where it needed be
For all to see.

In roots the sugar flowed
Out of phloem's abode,
And with it water went
Back to xylem, sent

To start the cycle new
That served the whole way through
The kingdom, high and low,
And helped it grow.

And by this system fair
The roots received their share,
And faithful sons of bright
Glomeros' sight

Received what they were owed
For traveling the road
Of service to the whole
By playing their small role.

And so the wood wide web
Of Pholon's love would ebb
And flow throughout the land
Built by his own hand.

Through faithful Mycorrhizae
He provided for his eye
To see his sons well-fed
With living bread.

Pholon became known
As Cookson, and he'd grown
Into a provider
And faithful guider

Who brought prosperity
To all who'd ever be
Within his kingdom's bounds
Where justice's sound

Could guide them day by day
Along their living way
Where all received their share
Of what was growing there.

His sons lived underground
And they had found
The wood-wide web could feed
Their every need

Without the work of making
Their own bread-breaking
Through photosynthesis—
They found their bliss

In lazy prosperity
Throughout their spree
Of plenty without toil
From the rich soil.

And this is how the roles
Of ancient souls
Swapped their positions
In life's transmissions:

Sporophyte and gametophyte
Switched in the sight
Of those who understand
How life's command

Can change when times require
New forms to aspire
To heights beyond the old
In stories yet untold.

Cookson bore a grandson
Whose work, when it was done,
Would change the world entire:
Tracheus' desire.

By Tracheus' mighty hand
The tracheophytes' band
Was born to rule the earth
Through evolutionary birth.

Tracheus built leaves bright,
Microphylls in sight
With veins that carried life
Through harmony, not strife.

Solar panels they became
In his energy game
Of green power from the sun
That could not be outdone.

He built his city great
Beyond what any fate
Had ever seen before
From mountain peak to shore.

Greater even than
Great Pholon's mighty plan
His city rose on high
Beneath the starry sky.

He designated clans
According to his plans
For those who'd serve the whole
By playing their small role.

Collenchyma he named
One clan, and they were famed
For flexible support
Of every kind and sort

To keep his city strong
Throughout its whole life long
Journey through the days
Of evolutionary ways.

And Sclerenchyma's clan
He built with different plan:
Hard and full of lignin,
Their work would begin

The age of wood so strong
That would last life long
And give the world its trees
That dance upon the breeze.

Soon the sons of Tracheus
Would rule, victorious,
The lands from sea to sea
For all eternity.

The Devonian was
Beginning, and because
Of what these pioneers
Had built through joy and tears,

The world would never be
The same for you and me
Who walk upon the land
Built by their own hand.

From Polycomb's rebellion
Against her life's subjection
To Tracheus' city bright
That reached toward the light,

The plants have shown the way
That leads from night to day
Of freedom and of growth
Supported by the oath

To serve the greater good
While taking what they could
To feed their own deep need
For growth like planted seed.

From burning scriptures old
That kept them in the hold
Of others' narrow dreams
To building the streams

Of water, food, and light
That make the future bright
With possibility
For all eternity,

The plants remind us all
Who hear their gentle call
That growth requires the will
To climb each higher hill

Of what we can become
When we are no longer numb
To all that we could be
If we would just be free

From limitations old
In stories never told
Of what we're meant to do
For me and you today.

The wood wide web they built
Without any guilt
Shows how cooperation
Across every nation

Of life can help us grow
Beyond what we can know
Alone, but when we share
Our burdens and our care,

The whole becomes much more
Than what came before
When each one tried alone
To build their place and home.

From Polycomb's first read
Of scriptures that had led
Her people into chains
To Tracheus' domains

That reached toward the sun
With work that's never done
Of growing toward the light
With all their mortal might,

The plants show us the way
To live from day to day
In harmony with all
Who answer life's sweet call

To grow beyond the small
And heed the greater call
Of what we can achieve
When we truly believe

In possibility
Through all eternity
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you today.

The Devonian dawn
When old ways were withdrawn
And new forms took their place
In evolution's race

Was built by those who dared
To break what others shared
As truth that could not bend
But had to find its end

In those with clearer sight
Who walked toward the light
Of what could be achieved
When freedom was believed.

From Polycomb to Tracheus,
The plants victorious
Show how rebellion's fire
Can lift us ever higher

To heights we never dreamed
When we were what seemed
Too small to make a change
Beyond familiar range.

But when we dare to read
The scriptures that would feed
Our minds with truth set free
From false authority,

And when we dare to burn
What makes our spirits yearn
For freedom never known
In chains we've outgrown,

Then we can build anew
What's beautiful and true
And reach toward the sun
Until our work is done

Of making this world bright
With love's eternal light
That shines for all to see
Through all eternity.

The plants that Tracheus made
Will never ever fade
From this world's living face
But hold their rightful place

As teachers of the way
To live from day to day
In growth toward the light
That makes the future bright

With hope for all who dare
To breathe the freedom's air
And grow beyond what's known
Into what they've outgrown.

The Devonian age began
With more than mortal plan
To free the world from chains
And heal its ancient pains

Through growth and light and love
Blessed from above
With power to transcend
All limits without end.

From burning scriptures old
To stories yet untold
Of what we can become
When we are no longer numb

To all our hearts can hold
Of courage, strong and bold,
The plants show us the way
To freedom's bright new day.

---

Devon's city was the greatest sight
Among all cities burning bright
In that era, and so
The name would always show:

The new era was called
Devonian, enthralled
By Devon's mighty rule
Like some divine school.

As Devon sat upon
The ground when day begun,
He sucked water so pure
Into his gill, secure

Between his jaws and skull,
Notched and beautiful
In its design so fine
Like architecture divine.

Through his spiracle bright
His mouth filled with sight
Of water, and the gold
Of oxygen, so old

Yet rich beyond all measure
Like some sacred treasure
Built through millennia long
By Saya's daughters' song.

Through his gills the flow
Of hematic maidens go,
Carrying oxygen sweet
To make his life complete.

To all his subjects they
Would carry, night and day,
The breath of life so pure
That would always endure.

And to the brain they went
Through spiracle, well-sent
To bring much more to eyes
Beneath the starry skies

And brain that ruled his form
Through calm and raging storm
With wisdom and with might
Both day and through the night.

In opposition's way
And countercurrent's play,
The blood took oxygen
Like wise and faithful men

Who know the secret art
Of playing their true part
In life's eternal dance
Of every circumstance.

When Devon moved his frame
Through waters without shame,
He opened his mouth wide
And let the water glide

Freely over and through
His gills, so tried and true,
With current's gentle flow
That helped his body grow.

When he found food to eat
To make his life complete,
He cleaved it with his jaw
According to the law

Of predatory might
That filled the world with sight
Of what the strong can do
When they are tried and true.

And behind his teeth bright
That gleamed like morning light,
His jaws would follow through
And chew what he could chew.

Down in his stomach deep
Where acids always keep
Their vigil through the night,
Food was purified bright.

Pancreas and gallbladder
Joined like faithful gladder
Partners in the art
Of playing their true part.

And intestine spiraling
Beyond all parallel-ing
In numbers without end
Would help his form transcend

Its limits, and nutrition
Would enter, transmission
Into his veins so bright
That carried day and night

His portal vein would bring
Life's most essential thing:
Fats and sugars sweet,
Proteins complete,

Phosphorus and metals
That settled like petals
Of life within his form,
Through calm and raging storm.

And vitamins so pure
That would always endure
Throughout his living days
In their life-giving ways.

And his liver would clean
His blood, and always keen
To purify and bless
What others would caress

With poison or with harm
That might his spirit harm,
His liver worked each day
To keep death's touch away.

The kidneys emptied in
All waste, and without sin
They filtered what was pure
From what could not endure.

And out the cloaca
Went waste, and none could mock-a
The wisdom of design
That was so fine.

When Devon married fair
His wife beyond compare,
He released his sperm bright
Into her loving sight.

Out the cloaca's door
To her eggs, and what's more,
From his million children
Two would be the risen:

Llŷr and Stennisio,
Both glorious
In their appointed ways
Throughout their living days.

The sons of Stennisio
Lived in ratio
Across the seafloor wide
With ocean as their guide.

Eating clams each day
In their ancient way,
They lived lives of the deep
Where ocean secrets keep.

Llŷr begat Bran so strong
Who lived his whole life long
In wisdom and in might
Both day and through the night.

Bran begat Caradoc,
Solid as a rock
In all his noble ways
Throughout his living days.

Caradoc begat three:
Cynan of the sea,
Acantho, strong and true,
And Sudopedal too.

The daughters of Acantho
Were beautiful, and so
They filled the world with grace
In every watery place.

Cynan begat Cadwr,
Who'd be the withdrawer
Of none from their true course
But guide with gentle force.

Cadwr begat Eudaf,
Who never would laugh
At those who tried their best
To pass each mortal test.

Eudaf begat Morfawr,
Whose name means "great war"
But he was man of peace
Where all strife would cease.

Morfawr begat two sons:
Tudwal when day begun
And Rhineheart the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Rhineheart lived upon
The Rhine when day begun,
Flattened and hidden well
Like some secret spell.

Invisible was he
To those who couldn't see
The wisdom of his way
Throughout each passing day.

Like ray before rays came
To win their lasting fame,
He lived his hidden life
Without much joy or strife.

Tudwal begat two more:
Cynfawr to explore
And Antiarchon wild
Who was rebellion's child.

Antiarchon rebelled
Against all that was held
As truth by ancestors
And other predecessors.

He stood against Archons—
An Anarchist who spawns
Revolution in his heart
To play rebellion's part.

He lived beneath the soil
And waited there to spoil
The plans of those above
Who knew not how to love.

For prey he'd always wait
To seal their mortal fate
With ambush from below
Where none would ever go

To look for him or find
His revolutionary mind
That plotted every day
To make his enemies pay.

The sons of Antiarchon
Would form great bands upon
The earth, guerrillas all
Who'd answer freedom's call.

They'd haunt the sons of bright
Animus day and night
Until the world was free
From their authority.

But Cynfawr chose instead
A path where he was led
By dreams of finding home
Wherever he would roam.

Custennin was his son
Who when his search begun
Would travel far and wide
With hope as his guide.

He searched through every land
Until he'd understand
Where he was meant to be
For all eternity.

And finally he found
Upon the fertile ground
Of China, far away,
His home where he could stay.

Custennin begat two:
Uther, tried and true,
And Petallon so bright
Who filled the world with sight.

Uther begat then
Two children beyond ken:
Arthur and Maxil strong
Who lived their whole life long.

Arthur bore in time
A son and daughter fine:
Arthur the Younger, who'd
Do more than others could,

And Ptycho, maiden fair
Beyond all compare
In beauty and in grace
Throughout her dwelling place.

The daughters of fair Ptycho
Were numerous, and so
Among them was one great:
Mary, whose fate

Would be to bear a son
When her work was done
That none had done before
From mountain peak to shore.

Mary, Mother of
Icthys, blessed with love
From heaven high above,
Bore placenta's shove

Millions of years before
Any others wore
This gift of nurturing
That motherhood would bring.

The sons of Arthur then
(The Younger) beyond ken
Became known far and wide
As those who'd be the guide

Of Arthrodires' line
With characteristics fine
Throughout the world so vast
From first unto the last.

Arthur the Younger bore
Three sons to explore
The world with different eyes:
Mordred, who'd comprise

Rebellion in his heart,
And Wuttago's part,
And Actino the bright
Who filled the world with sight.

Mordred turned against
His father, and he fenced
With honor's sacred code
Upon dishonor's road.

He bore two sons in time:
Philip, so prime
In all his evil ways,
And Melehan's days

Of darkness and of shame
That blackened his name
Throughout the world entire
With corruption's fire.

Melehan begat two:
Brachy, tried and true
In evil's darkest art,
And Phlyctae's part.

The sons of Brachy ruled
The world, and they schooled
All others in their might,
Overthrowing the sight

Of Silur's ancient line
That once was so divine
But now would have to yield
To Brachy's battlefield.

Brachy begat three:
Eubar of the sea,
Buchan, strong and wild,
And Homosteus' child.

Eubar begat two:
Pachos, tried and true,
And Coccos, who would be
Living by the sea.

Pachos begat then
Two children beyond ken:
Dunkella, who would grow
Greater than we know

Any had before
From mountain peak to shore,
And Aspino the bright
Who filled the world with sight.

Dunkella grew to be
Greatest yet to see
Among all Metazo:
Six meters high to show

Her power and her might—
Three Jaekelopterii bright
In length, and though not long
As Cameroceras strong,

She had a thousand times
His men in war's rhymes
And ruled with iron hand
Throughout the entire land.

The sons and daughters all
Of Pachos heard the call
To greatness, and they grew
Strong and powerful too.

They ruled the world entire
In that age of fire
When power was the law
That all the world saw.

But Maxil, Arthur's brother,
Bore a child like no other:
Qilinyu was his name,
Who'd win eternal fame.

Qilinyu begat
Entelognathus, begat
With jaw that was complete
From head down to feet.

Entelognathus bore
Janusicthus to explore
The world with newer art
That set his line apart.

Janusicthus brought
His teeth as none had thought
From gills unto his jaw
According to new law.

And so his jaw crushed down
With teeth of great renown—
Not bone, but teeth so bright
That gleamed like morning light.

He brought his skull inside
His head, and there to bide
The nerves would always dwell
That served his body well.

Sensing all around
His form, without a sound
He knew what others felt
When danger near them dwelt.

He became the sire
Of all who'd aspire
To be both fish and beast
From greatest unto least.

From Devon's city great
To Janusicthus' fate
That led to fish and more,
The tale from shore to shore

Shows how innovation's art
Can play the vital part
In making life evolve
And every problem solve

That stands upon the way
Of progress every day
From simple unto complex
In life's eternal specs.

From gill to lung to jaw
That follows newer law,
Each change that life would make
Was for survival's sake.

But also shows how some
Will choose what they become
Through violence and through greed
That plants destruction's seed.

While others choose the way
Of peace from day to day
And building something new
That's beautiful and true.

From Antiarchon's revolt
Against the lightning bolt
Of tyranny and power
In that ancient hour,

To Mary's gift of love
Blessed from above
That nurtured life within
Her womb, free from sin,

The lineages show how
We must choose here and now
What kind of world we'll make
For all our children's sake.

The Devonian age
Wrote upon history's page
The story of the choice
Between two different voice:

The voice of those who'd build
And those who'd never yield
To others' right to live
But only take, not give.

From Devon's peaceful ways
Throughout his living days
To Brachy's iron rule
That made the world his tool,

The lesson's clear to see:
We choose what we will be
And what our children learn
As time's great pages turn.

The fish that Janusicthus made
Will never ever fade
From this world's waters bright
But swim throughout the night

And day with teeth and jaw
That follow nature's law
But also serve the good
As all creation should.

From Devon's spiracle
To Dunkella's miracle
Of size and power great,
The vertebrates' fate

Shows how life finds its way
From night into the day
Of possibility
For all eternity.

The Devonian dawn
When old forms were withdrawn
And newer forms took place
In evolution's race

Was built by those who dared
To dream and who cared
For more than what they were
And what they could confer

Upon the world around
Where they could be found
Living day by day
In their chosen way.

From Devon's city bright
To fish with tooth and sight,
The age shows what can grow
When we let courage flow

Through every choice we make
For all our children's sake
Who'll inherit what we build
In the fields we've tilled

With love or hate or fear
Throughout each passing year
Of our brief time on earth
Where we show our worth

By what we choose to do
For me and you
And every living thing
That answers life's ring.

The Devonian age began
With more than mortal plan
To make the world more bright
With love's eternal light

That shines in every heart
That plays the loving part
In life's eternal song
That makes the weak grow strong.

From Devon's peaceful reign
To Brachy's war-torn stain
Upon the world's bright face,
The lesson and the grace

Of choice is clear to see:
We are what we choose to be
And what we choose to leave
For those who still believe

In possibility
Through all eternity
Where love will find a way
To light each darkening day

With hope that never dies
Beneath the starry skies
Where all our dreams can grow
If we will let them flow

From hearts that dare to care
For life everywhere
That grows beneath the sun
Until all time is done.

# Chapter 55: The Forest Cathedral

As Devon's sons grew strong and true in might,
The spineless sons of bright Proteus fair
Prepared themselves to join the ancient fight
For rule beneath the ocean's flowing care.

In Devon's shadow they grew day by day,
Their strength increasing with each passing hour,
Building themselves to drink what victory's way
Would bring them through their faithful, growing power.

Among great Spiralius' noble line,
Neo arose in tenth generation's race
Of Bactridius blessed and divine,
The smartest soul in all his time and place.

Intelligence beyond what others knew
Or ever could pursue through all their days,
Yet what he possessed in genius true,
He lacked in wisdom's ancient, faithful ways.

He spurned his kin and ancestors so wise,
Refused to learn from those who came before
Who faced the storms beneath the starry skies
And learned through pain what peace was truly for.

And so he and his seed were cursed to bear
The weight of always starting from the start,
Reinventing what their fathers used to share
As wisdom's gift to guide the faithful heart.

Neo bore two sons of noble birth and might:
Great Ammon when the dawn began its day,
And Coleos the strong, whose faithful sight
Would guide him through his long and wondrous way.

Both sons would reinvent what fathers knew,
The wheel of wisdom that had come before,
Ignoring lessons that were tried and true
From those who'd walked this path from shore to shore.

Coleos wrapped his shell with mantle's care,
And through his innovation wrought with art
His shell's protection grew beyond compare
From mountain peak to shore, each single part.

His armor was complete from head to tail,
A fortress that would never know defeat,
Protection that would never, ever fail
To keep him safe from foe he chanced to meet.

Great Ammon grew a shell of coiled design,
Compact and true to serve his heart's desire,
Wherever destiny would draw the line
He'd dwell with freedom bright as sacred fire.

He swam through waters blue where others fished,
But made his home wherever he would roam,
Free as the wind that danced as he had wished
Throughout the vast and boundless ocean's dome.

Among the sons of bright Ectus' great might,
Malacus bore three sons of noble fame:
Caridus of the sea so fair and bright,
And Phyllos strong who'd honor his great name,

And Hoplos, through and through a warrior true
Whose heart was set upon the fighting way,
He'd play his part in all they'd ever do
With courage burning bright from night to day.

Caridus bore two sons beyond compare:
Syn Peras and great Yuval, answering
The call of destiny with faithful care
To make their lineage great in everything.

Throughout the world so wide from shore to shore
With ocean as their guide through all their days,
They'd build what none had ever built before
And walk in their appointed, faithful ways.

Peras bore children many, strong and true:
Amphipus none could match in all his might,
And brave Isopus too, and others who
Would serve with faithful hearts both day and night.

His wife, fair Possa, carried them with care
And never tarried in their nourishment,
According to her sacred, mother's prayer
And oath of love that heaven to her sent.

Of motherhood so pure it would endure
Throughout the years to come when wars were done,
Within her pouch they grew both strong and sure,
Fed by her love beneath the blazing sun.

Great Yuval bore two sons of different ways:
Decapus when the dawn began to break,
And Krillon small, who'd spend his faithful days
In answering the ocean's call for sake.

Krillon remained small throughout all his time
And swam beneath the skies of ocean blue
In all his days, and in his gentle rhyme
He kept his aquatic ways both tried and true.

But brave Decapus grew both large and strong
And took command by sinking to the floor
Of ocean's deepest realm, where all life long
He'd rule from mountain peak to distant shore.

And so the crustaceans would be ruled,
As was both right and proper they should be,
By three great houses, never to be fooled:
The lords of ocean's vast community.

Amphipods from the blessed, divine line
Of great Amphipus, noble, tried, and true,
Isopods from Isopus' design
Who'd make their father's legacy shine through,

And brave Decapods who came to fame
From great Decapus' everlasting name—
The three great houses whose eternal glory
Would last through all of evolutionary story.

Decapus bore two sons both tried and true:
Great Pleos, faithful through each passing day,
And Prawnmegas the great, whose destiny too
Would seal his lineage fate in every way.

Prawnmegas became the ancestor
Of prawns throughout the sea's community,
Their father and their faithful protector
Through all the years of their nativity.

An unfortunate son of Prawnmegas,
Begun in sorrow and in bitter shame,
Still bears today his father's name, alas,
A reminder of his heritage and fame.

Great Pleos bore two sons of noble birth:
Repton to explore from sea to sea,
And brave Shrimpon, who'd prove his faithful worth
As father by the ocean's majesty.

Shrimpon became the noble, faithful sire
Of shrimp whose greatest joy and sweet desire
Was boxing and much more from shore to shore,
Protecting what they loved forevermore.

Repton bore two sons in their prime:
Thalasson of the mud, and Omar's name
Whose blood would flow through generations' time
In lobster veins and bring eternal fame.

Great Omar became the faithful father
Of those who'd choose the lobster's bold way,
And crayfish too, who'd rather
Live with claws so mighty night and day.

Thalasson became the noble, faithful father
Of mud shrimp, who would build what none before
Had ever willed to make, and they would rather
Create than conquer—architects who bore

Great channels carved in stone that they called home,
Cities beneath the sea for all to see
Throughout eternity beneath the foam
Of ocean's vast and boundless majesty.

To this day we honor all their works
As donors of great beauty to the world,
Their cities where no evil ever lurks
In fossilized remains lie unfurled.

They tell us stories of Thallasintep great
And others who were sealed by loving fate
In stone for us to see and understand
Their architecture throughout ocean's land.

Their works survive time's most destructive hand
And speak to us across the years between
Of how great builders helped us understand
What beauty means and what it's always been.

Meiuron, noble son in the line
Of tenth generation of Thalasson's race,
Rejected what his fathers thought divine
And chose to find a different dwelling place.

He left the depths that lay far below
To live upon the face of ocean bright,
Where currents and the tides would ever flow
Beneath the dome of day and stars of night.

Meiuron bore two sons of different ways:
Anomuron, begun in quiet peace,
And Saraton, who through his living days
Showed vanity that never seemed to cease.

Saraton was agile, skilled, and fast,
Yet vain and proud, his ego fragile too,
He needed praise from first day to last
In everything he'd ever try to do.

And so he constantly promoted well
His body as the best above the rest,
His propaganda had a tale to tell
Of how his form surpassed each other test.

But pride and shame had planted their dark seed
Within his heart, and blackened his good name,
For vanity will always intercede
Between the soul and honor's lasting fame.

The sons of brave Anomuron would live
In quiet ways when each new day begun,
They'd dwell in peace with all they had to give
Within their neighborhood beneath the sun.

As squat lobsters they'd make their dwelling place
And tell their stories of the humble way,
Of simple living and amazing grace
Throughout each blessed and ordinary day.

This quiet life would change in future time
When ten generations' faithful rhyme
Had passed away, and they would come to find
A different and more adventurous mind.

Paguros was a son of Anomuron,
Begun with shell both weak and soft and frail
That others mocked from dusk until the dawn
And laughed at through each storm and gentle gale.

But in his dying breath before death came,
The Ammonite called Menses, full of grace,
Gave what dispenses shelter from all shame:
His shell to be Paguros' dwelling place.

And so Paguros became the faithful father
Of hermit crabs who bear with loving care
The shells that others left, and they would rather
Honor the dead than leave their treasure bare.

When death had been so kind to those before
As to release their hold on shells so bright,
The hermit crabs would use them evermore
As homes to keep them safe through day and night.

Alas, the great revolt of brave Proteus
Felt failure's bitter sting and painful dart,
No victory could come to those who'd thus
Rebelled with proud and unrepentant heart.

The great Protean rebellion failed to bring
Subjection to great Devon's mighty reign
That had endured through every storm of spring
And lasted life long through joy and pain.

The sons of Devon held their righteous power,
They never fell to those who rose in vain
Against their rule through each appointed hour
Well-fenced by truth that broke rebellion's chain.

But lo! a new frontier was opening wide
Where sons of brave Proteus at last could find
What they had never found beneath the tide:
A land to heal their wounded heart and mind.

Beneath the ocean's wave they could not save
Their honor from the shame of their defeat,
But now a new realm called beyond the wave
Where they could make their victory complete.

The frontier of the trees where land could see
New possibilities for societies,
Where forest offered them the chance to be
The founders of new communities.

There sons of brave Proteus would find at last
Victorious domains to claim with pride,
And build upon the ruins of the past
With hope and truth as their eternal guide.

From Neo's intelligence without the grace
Of wisdom from the past to guide his way,
To changes that would always show their face
In forms both old and new from day to day,

The lesson clear emerges for us all:
Intelligence alone will never last
Beyond our own brief span, but wisdom's call
To learn from those who've walked this way in past

Will build upon the stone of what they've known
And reach to greater heights with clearer sight,
While those who trust in their own strength alone
Will stumble in the darkness of the night.

From Ammon's coiled shell to the story told
Of brave Paguros and his borrowed home,
The crustaceans show how hearts grown bold
Can find new ways to live where'er they roam.

The three great houses strong—Amphipods true,
Isopods faithful in their chosen place,
And brave Decapods with their royal hue—
Show how diversity brings strength and grace.

From prawns to lobster claws, each found their way
To follow nature's laws from shore to shore,
And mud shrimp cities built to last for aye
Show beauty in the depths forevermore.

The quiet squat lobsters and hermit crabs
Who foster care for shells that others left
Teach us that wisdom never fails or flags
When love protects us from all sense of theft.

The great Protean rebellion's bitter end
Opened the sight of forests green and wide,
Where those who fell could rise and make amend
With hope and truth as their eternal guide.

From Neo's cursed pride to wisdom's light
That guides the hermit crab's protective shell,
The story shows us how to choose what's right
And build the future we would love to dwell.

The crustaceans teach us to design
Our lives with patterns beautiful and true,
That run through space and time in rhythm fine
With music of the spheres in all we do.

For those who dare to dream of something more
And turn their dreams to life through love, not strife,
Will find the paths that lead to wisdom's shore
Where all can share in everlasting life.

# Chapter 56: The Settler King

*Arboreus divides the world between his sons, establishing the great plant dynasties*

---

## The Great Division

When Arboreus, son of Tracheus, claimed  
His throne among the ancient forest lords,  
He looked upon the lands as yet unnamed  
And spoke these wise and far-resounding words:  

"My sons, the world spreads wide before our sight,  
With fertile valleys, mountains capped with snow,  
Each realm shall serve a different kind of might,  
Each path shall let a different glory grow."  

To Lycos bold he gave the power of spores,
Released like dust upon the waiting wind,
While Ginkgon claimed the leafy, branching shores
Where megaphylls in sunlight would rescind.  

Thus did the settler king divide his realm  
Between two sons to rule with different helm.  

---

## The Spore-Bearer's Domain

Great Lycos spread his countless spores abroad
Like golden powder dancing on the breeze,
And from those tiny seeds blessed by his God
Arose two sons beneath the ancient trees.

Isolagos the first, who learned to part
His spores 'tween male and female, each their own,
Within his city, built with greatest art,
He raised both sons and daughters fully grown.

Lycopodion the second claimed his right  
To build the first tree ever seen on earth,  
A scale tree reaching up toward the light,  
Of such immense and awe-inspiring girth.  

The club-moss ancestor, his name lives on  
In Lycopodium powder, fire's dawn.  

---

## The Children of Isolagos

From spore-divided Isolagos came
Two sons of vastly different destiny:
Bold Quill who sought the underwater fame,
And wise Sellagine, master of the sea.

Sellagine's children learned to creep and crawl  
Their leaves across the forest floor below,  
In drought they died, but when the rains would fall  
They lived again with resurrection's glow.  

The Quillworts from noble Quill descend,  
Their microphylls reach tall toward the sky,  
No stomata their surfaces defend -  
Through roots they breathe, their spores where waters lie.  

Underground their stems in darkness grow  
While leaves above catch morning's golden glow.  

---

## The Megaphyll Master

But Ginkgon chose a different path to tread:
His leaves branched out in patterns two by two,
Megaphyllic glory crowned his head
As through the forest depths his lineage grew.

From him came forth bold Phyllon as his heir,
Who mastered all the arts of leafy might,
And Phyllon's sons would spread both far and near  
To claim their kingdoms in the dawning light.  

Two sons had Phyllon in the days of old:
Pteridos the brave, Gymnos the wise,  
Their names in plant lore ever shall be told  
As founders of the kingdoms of the skies.  

From their great loins would spring the fern and tree  
That rule the forest's vast complexity.  

---

## The Line of Pteridos

Pteridos the fern-father had two sons:
Bold Horsa of the puzzlegrass and spear,
And wise Euspor, from whom the lineage runs
Of all the fronds we still hold dear.

From Horsa came great Equis, he who found
Fair Puzella swimming in the stream,  
Their gametophytes merged without a sound  
To birth a dynasty beyond a dream.  

But Equis faced a choice both hard and stark:
Keep megaphylls or join with Lycos' way?  
He chose the path of simple leaves and dark,  
One vein alone would serve him every day.  

In silicon armor he encased his town  
While spores spread far beyond the forest's crown.  

---

## The Seasonal Cycle

Wise Equis learned the rhythm of the year  
And built his kingdom on the wheel of time:  
In spring when snowmelt made the waters clear  
He raised horsetails in patterns sublime.  

No chlorophyll these springtime children bore,  
Just spores released in clouds across the land,  
While through the earth their nutrients they store  
For summer's work by their creator's hand.  

When summer came he tore the horsetails down  
And built puzzlegrass in their sacred place,  
With chlorophyll of green and leafy crown  
To gather sunlight's energizing grace.  

Thus seasons turned in Equis' grand design:  
Spring spores, summer grass, in rhythm fine.  

---

## The Fern Dynasty

From wise Euspor came branches of the tree
That split 'tween Adderos and Fernando,  
Each claiming their own realm of destiny  
Where different kinds of fronds would grow.  

Adderos sired Ophios the strange,
Who built but one great leaf of mighty size,
And Psilos, dwelling in the mountain range,
Who needed not leaves beneath the skies.

The adder's-tongue from brave Ophios came,
While whisk ferns trace to Psilos as their sire,  
Each keeping alive their ancestor's name  
Through spore and frond and roots of living fire.  

Fernando spread his fronds in patterns wide
With Maratton standing close beside his side.  

---

## The Great Swamp Settlement

Maratidus and Leptos were the sons
That noble Maratton brought into the world,  
Ten thousand spores the first one always runs  
While hundred spores the second's fronds unfurled.  

Together they became the fern-lords true,  
The ancestors of all the fronds we see,  
From forest floor to canopy of blue  
Their children spread in vast complexity.  

And as these sons of brave Arboreus  
Built swamplands by the Mississippi's shore,  
They prepared the way, unknowing thus,  
For those who'd walk where none had walked before.  

For here the sons of bold Osticthus  
Would leave the sea and claim the land for us.  

---

## The Settler's Legacy

Thus did Arboreus the settler king  
Divide the world 'tween spore and megaphyll,  
And from his choice would countless blessings spring  
That serve the forest kingdoms still.  

The club-moss and the fern, the tree so tall,  
The puzzlegrass and horsetails of the spring,  
From his great line they came to rule them all  
And honor their ancestral king.  

Though seasons pass and eras come and go,  
And mighty forests rise and fall to dust,  
The legacy of him who chose to sow  
His kingdom wide remains a sacred trust.  

For in each spore and in each frond unfurled  
Lives on the dream of his divided world.  

---

*Thus did Arboreus establish the great plant dynasties that would rule the forests of the earth, preparing the swamplands where vertebrates would first venture from sea to land.*
