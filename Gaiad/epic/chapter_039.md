{{c|Fire}} rained down from sky
And many had to die.
The first extinction came
With death's devouring flame.

For years in heaven's height
{{c|Hengweh}} and {{c|Mithra}} fight.
They wrestled in the air
And blocked sun's light so fair.

The {{c|Archaeocyathids}} fell,
Their cities rang death's knell.
The {{c|Trilobites}} and more—
{{c|Brachiopods}} by the score—

And {{c|Hyoliths}} barely
{{c|Survived}} that calamity.
The {{c|Botomian}} time had passed,
Its glory could not last.

Then {{c|Mithra}} spoke these words
To one who serves:
"{{c|Wiwaxius}}, I choose thee
To set the world life free.

{{c|Restore}} what has been lost
And count extinction's cost.
{{c|Protect}} us from the doom
That fills up every room."

{{c|Wiwaxius}} begat two sons:
{{c|Molluscus}} when day begun
And {{c|Kamptos}}, poor and weak,
Who had no strength to seek

Great things or mighty deeds.
He built what barely feeds
A small and brainless state—
A kingdom with no fate.

But {{c|Molluscus}} bore many
{{c|Sons}}, more than any
Other patriarch could claim.
{{c|Eldest}} was {{c|Testar}}'s name.

{{c|Testar}} the sixteen-plated
Built shell sophisticated.
A great thick shell he made
Of valves in organized parade.

{{c|Sixteen}} valves in all:
{{c|Eight}} large and eight small.
{{c|Eight}} upon the right
And eight upon the left so bright.

His brothers had no care
For building anywhere.
{{c|Bad}} work ethics they possessed,
{{c|Never}} did their best.

{{c|Solenos}} just drank the blood
Of sons through ocean's flood:
{{c|Ctenofer}} and {{c|Cnider}}'s line
Became his bloody wine.

And {{c|Caudos}} ate his fill
Of {{c|Foramer}} at will.
He cared not for the art
Of building any part.

But {{c|Testar}} bore two sons:
{{c|Chiton}} when day begun
And {{c|Conchifer}} {{c|Verticus}},
Both builders glorious.

{{c|Chiton}} {{c|Horizontus}}
{{c|Unified}} like kratos
His shells in horizontal row:
{{c|Eight}} shells in neat tableau.

He became the ancestor
Of chitons, protector
With eight shells side by side
Along his lengthy hide.

The sons of {{c|Chiton}} roll
When threatened from their goal.
But they aren't very wise—
They gave up brain's prize

{{c|Long}} ago in time past,
Their simple ways held fast.
{{c|Intelligence}} they traded
For armor that's not faded.

{{c|Conchifer}} {{c|Verticus}}
Made his way glorious
By unifying vertical
His shells so beautiful.

A shell upon his left,
A shell upon his right—
His vertical bereft
Of horizontal sight.

{{c|Conchifer}} bore two more:
{{c|Bivos}} to explore
The hinged shell's way,
And {{c|Monos}} every day.

{{c|Bivos}} kept his hinged design
While {{c|Monos}} made combine
His shells into just one—
Two paths when day begun.

{{c|Bivos}} laid in sand
{{c|Throughout}} the fertile land
And fished food from the sea
Most gracefully.

When threatened he would close
His shells against his foes.
{{c|Together}} they would shut
Like door without a cut.

His children came to lay
Upon their sides each day.
{{c|Soon}} they looked the same
As {{c|Brachios}}' great name.

They became {{c|Bivalves}} true:
{{c|Clams}} and mussels too,
{{c|Oysters}} in their beds
With protective heads.

The sons of {{c|Monos}} first
Found little luck, dispersed
Without much success.
But time would bless

Their patient, single shell.
{{c|Monoplacophores}} dwell
With nothing but one plate
As their identifying trait.

But {{c|Carlos}} the curly one,
{{c|Grandson}} when day begun,
Had ideas quite different
From others' management.

He walked across the seas
{{c|Exploring}} as he'd please,
{{c|Discovering}} countless things
That wonder always brings.

He bore two sons of fame:
{{c|Gastropus}} was the name
Of one, and {{c|Digitos}}
The other, strong and close.

{{c|Gastropus}} twisted round
Into spiral profound.
His shell developed might
Through this spiraling sight.

He became ancestor
Of snails, protector
With shells that coil and turn
In patterns we discern.

Each generation more
Would curl than those before
And grow in strength each day
Through their spiraling way.

{{c|Today}} his distant sons
Still coil when day begun.
From garden snail so small
To conch shells standing tall.

{{c|Digitos}} made his foot
Into tentacles suit
For different kind of life
Through joy and through strife.

{{c|Digitos}} bore two sons:
{{c|Cephalopus}} when begun
The day, and {{c|Scaphopus}},
Not quite so glorious.

{{c|Cephalopus}} studied long
And made his body strong
Through learning how to fly
With buoyancy on high.

He built a coiling shell
With chambers that would dwell
With gas for floating light
Through day and through the night.

Through this he learned to soar
Above the ocean floor.
He even built with care
{{c|Circulatory}} system there

Like {{c|Annelids}} and those
Of {{c|Chordates}} who propose
That closed systems are best
For meeting every test.

His mind grew sharp and keen,
The brightest ever seen
Among the mollusks all
Who answer ocean's call.

But {{c|Scaphopus}} lived lazy
In the ground so hazy.
He became ancestor
Of tusk shells, protector

Of nothing but his ease.
{{c|Simple}} creatures please
Themselves with brainless ways,
{{c|Living}} all their days

{{c|Underground}} they dwell
Within their tusk-like shell.
They prey on {{c|Foramer}}'s sons
When hunting time begun.

Through this story we learn
How small choices earn
Great consequences wide
Across time's flowing tide.

The sons of {{c|Molluscus}} grew
And flourished, spreading through
The world in every way,
{{c|Taking}} roles each day

That others could not fill.
Through strength of mind and will
They rose from extinction's
{{c|Fire}} to distinctions

Great and glorious.
{{c|Molluscus}} victorious
Showed how from single start
Many forms depart

To fill each niche and place
With their unique grace.
From simple shell began
{{c|Evolution}}'s great plan

That led to snails that crawl
And squids that enthrall
With intelligence bright
And bivalves' filtering sight.

The first extinction's flame
Could not destroy the name
Of those who build with care
Their future everywhere.

When fire rained from sky
And many had to die,
The builders who remained
Were those who had sustained

Their vision through the dark
And left their lasting mark
On world that needed those
Who from destruction rose.

{{c|Wiwaxius}} heard the call
To save life from the fall
And through his chosen sons
{{c|New}} chapters begun

Of life upon the earth
That celebrates the worth
Of building something strong
That will endure so long.

From {{c|Testar}}'s sixteen plates
To forms that time creates
In endless variety,
The mollusks' piety

To building shows the way
That life can win the day
Against extinction's threat
When builders' skills are set

To work with patient art
That plays the vital part
In restoration's song
That makes the weak grow strong.

In every shell we see
Upon the sand so free,
Remember {{c|Molluscus}}' choice
To lift up building's voice

Above destruction's roar
And open up the door
To future filled with hope
Where builders help life cope

With challenges that come
Until the final sum
Of all their work is done
Beneath the shining sun.

The first extinction taught
That those who come to naught
Are those who do not build
But let their dreams be stilled.

But those who build with care
Will flourish everywhere
And fill the world with forms
That weather all life's storms.

From simplest shell's start
To cephalopod's art
Of swimming through the sea
With brain's complexity,

The mollusks show the way
That builders win the day
When extinction's fire
Would end life's choir.

Their shells protect and serve
Their forms with every curve
{{c|Designed}} for life's demands
In seas and on the lands.

So honor {{c|Molluscus}}' name
And his enduring fame
As father of the line
That shows building's divine

{{c|Power}} to restore
What was lost before
And make the world anew
With forms both strong and true.
