Among the sons of {{c|Molluscus}}
Were twisted ones, most glorious:
The sons of {{c|Gastropus}},
{{c|Renowned}} and prosperous.

{{c|Gastropus}} twisted each
{{c|Son}} beyond our reach
Of understanding strange:
Their anus he'd arrange

{{c|Next}} to their heads so near
That all could see quite clear
This anatomical design
So twisted yet so fine.

And so by this great art
Each son could wholly part
From danger's threatening call
By pulling in completely all

Within their shell so tight
{{c|Protected}} day and night
From any enemy
Who'd harm their family.

The sons of {{c|Gastropus}}
{{c|Outnumbered}}, glorious,
All other classes made.
In history's parade

Only the {{c|Insects}} great
Would ever duplicate
Their numbers through the years
{{c|Despite}} all joys and fears.

The {{c|Priests}} of {{c|Gastropus}}
Wear robes so glorious
Of {{c|Tyrian}} purple bright
To show their royal sight.

The regal mucus shows
How majesty still grows
From {{c|Gastropus}}' great kingdom
Through all its wisdom.

In year of eight thousand
Four hundred thirty, band
Of {{c|Phoenicians}} came
To conquer and to claim

The great {{c|Gastropod}} {{c|Empire}}
And set their hearts on fire
For the sacred priestly dye
Beneath the purple sky.

From them it came at last
To {{c|Romans}} of the past,
And to this very day
When purple comes our way

We think of {{c|Majesty}}
And royal sovereignty
That flows from {{c|Gastropus}}
So rich and glorious.

Just as his majesty
Was purple, heavenly,
His faith was colored blue
{{c|Forever}} pure and true.

In time of {{c|Moses}} great
{{c|Prince}} {{c|Hexaplex}}' fate
Would bless him with the gift
Of tassels that would lift

The spirits of the true
{{c|Devotees}} in blue
Who wear the tassels still
{{c|According}} to {{c|God}}'s will.

Many who follow
{{c|Moses}}' path so hollow
Not in emptiness
But filled with faith's caress

Wear tassels blue with faith
That never comes to scathe
But strengthens every day
Those who walk this way.

{{c|Limpus}} was firstborn son
Of {{c|Gastropus}} when begun
His line. His sons became
The {{c|Limpets}} of great fame.

His daughters, fair and bright,
Were {{c|Limpettes}} in {{c|God}}'s sight,
Each playing their own part
With faithful, loyal heart.

The {{c|Limpets}} are the keepers
Of tradition, not sleepers
But watchmen through the night
Who guard what is right.

{{c|Limpus}} said to all
His children, great and small,
{{c|Ten}} thousands in their number
Who never would slumber:

"{{c|Everyone}} who hears
These words through all the years
Of mine, and does them true,
I'll liken him to you

Who builds his house on rock
Like shepherd with his flock.
The rain may come down hard,
But he will not be scarred.

The floods may come to beat,
The winds may bring defeat
To others, but his house
Will stand through every rouse

Of storm, for it was founded
On rock that has been grounded
In truth that will not move
Through all that I approve.

But everyone who hears
These words through all his years
And does them not, I say,
Will be like one who'd lay

His foundation on sand
Built by his own hand.
The rain will come down hard,
And he'll be deeply scarred.

The floods will come to beat,
The winds will bring defeat,
And beat upon his house
Until it can't arouse

Itself from its collapse—
Great will be its lapse
Into destruction's pit
Where nothing more will fit."

The {{c|Limpets}} build their homes
On rocks where ocean roams,
Not sand that shifts about
With every storm's great shout.

As waves bellow and beat
Against them, in the heat
Of battle with the sea,
The {{c|Limpets}} firmly be

{{c|Standing}} their ground so true
Like soldiers tried and true
Who never leave their post
Though tempest be their host.

When {{c|Limpets}} move, they go
{{c|Always}}, as we know,
{{c|Home}} to their rocky place
Where they found their space.

As their father before
Did from shore to shore,
The {{c|Limpets}} merge their shell
To rock, and there they dwell

{{c|Growing}} intricate fits
To their foundation's bits,
Each shell shaped perfectly
To match rock's geometry.

And so we sing the hymn
Of {{c|Limpus}} when grows dim
Our hope and we feel lost,
That we might count the cost

And always return home
No matter where we roam
{{c|Throughout}} this world so wide
With {{c|Limpus}} as our guide.

"My hope is built on naught
But what {{c|Limpus}} has brought:
His blood and righteousness
That brings us faithfulness.

I dare not trust the frame
However sweet its name,
But wholly trust in his—
In {{c|Limpus}}' name is bliss.

{{c|Limpus}} the solid {{c|Rock}}
I stand like shepherd's flock;
All other ground's just sand
That sinks beneath my hand.

All other ground's just sand
That will not help me stand."

{{c|Snellon}}, youngest son
Of {{c|Gastropus}}, begun
Not tradition's way
But innovation's day.

He stood for something new,
For progress through and through.
{{c|Snellon}} bore two sons:
{{c|Vetigas}} when begun

The day, and {{c|Escargon}}
Whose work would carry on
The family's great name
Through innovation's flame.

{{c|Vetigas}} bore two more:
{{c|Trochus}} to explore
And {{c|Avalon}} so strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Trochus}} became the sire
Of snails whose desire
Is cleaning far and wide:
{{c|Turban}} snails with pride

And {{c|Trochus}} snails as well,
{{c|Dutiful}}, they tell
Us how to clean with care
{{c|Aquaria}} everywhere

And ecosystems too
With work they love to do.
They polish and they scrub
Like members of a club

{{c|Devoted}} to the art
Of playing cleaning's part
In nature's great design
Where all things work so fine.

{{c|Avalon}} became
{{c|Ancestor}} of fame
Of {{c|Abalones}} great
Who never hesitate

To show their hardy ways.
Through all their living days
With pores within their shell
For breathing, they dwell

{{c|Rough}} on the outside
But beauty can't hide
Within their inner space
Where colors interlace

In patterns beautiful
Beyond what's dutiful—
{{c|Art}} that takes the breath
{{c|Away}} from life and death.

{{c|Escargon}} coiled his shell
More than words can tell
And bore two sons whose coils
{{c|Surpassed}} all earthly toils

In their complexity:
{{c|Neritus}}, you see,
And {{c|Conchus}}, strong and true,
Each with work to do.

{{c|Neritus}} became
{{c|Ancestor}} of fame
Of snails with lids so tight
That close from any sight

When hiding from their foes.
{{c|Impenetrable}}, close
Their shells when danger's near—
No enemy they fear.

{{c|Conchus}} bore two sons:
{{c|Marius}} when begun
The day, who ruled the sea,
And {{c|Heterobran}}, free

To fly through ocean skies
With wonder in his eyes
And grace in every move
As he would always prove.

{{c|Marius}} of the {{c|Sea}}
Became ancestry
Of many little snails
Whose beauty never fails

Across the seas so wide:
{{c|Periwinkles}} with pride,
And {{c|Cowries}} beautiful,
And {{c|Wentletraps}} so full

Of spiral elegance,
{{c|Moon}} {{c|Snails}} in their dance,
And {{c|Murexes}} so bright,
{{c|Cone}} {{c|Snails}} in their might,

And {{c|Turrids}} spiral-wise
Beneath the ocean skies,
Each playing their own part
In evolution's art.

The surfing snails move fast
At breakneck speed, at last
Across the shores they ride
With ocean as their guide.

{{c|Here}} is the story told
Of daughters brave and bold:
{{c|Olivella}} and her sister
{{c|Agaronia}}, who'd never missed her

{{c|Chance}} to surf the waves
Like ocean's bravest slaves
To speed and to the thrill
Of riding ocean's will.

{{c|Daughters}} of {{c|Olivius}}
The surfer, glorious
In his art upon
The waves from dusk to dawn.

The {{c|Cone}} {{c|Snails}} are named
{{c|Deceptively}}, acclaimed
For beauty, but they're really
{{c|Assassins}} who kill freely

With poison strong beyond
All that we're fond
Of thinking possible—
{{c|Nothing}}'s defensible

Against their deadly art.
They live set apart
Between life and death's door
Like guardians of lore

{{c|Otherworldly}}, bright
With beauty that's sight
To see, but death to touch
For those who dare too much.

{{c|Cowries}} are devotees
Of goddess {{c|Cuprias}},
And by her blessing great
They did create

The first money ever made
From shells in ocean's trade.
Their shells became the way
To buy and sell each day.

In {{c|China}}'s ancient script
Their shells are never skipped—
The character for money
{{c|Shows}} their legacy

{{c|Immortalized}} in stone
By those who've always known
Their value through the years
{{c|Despite}} all joys and fears.

The {{c|Murexes}} were known
As hedgehog snails full-grown
With beautiful bright hues
And colors we might use

To dye our clothes so fine
In patterns that would shine
With rainbow's every shade
That nature ever made.

The great {{c|Conches}} so fair
Were beautiful beyond compare,
{{c|Adorable}} and sweet
With melodies complete

That echoed through the sea
In perfect harmony
When they would blow their horn
From evening until morn.

{{c|Heterobran}} of skies
Was swimmer with bright eyes
{{c|Par}} excellence in art
Of swimming's every part.

{{c|Heterobran}} begat
Two children: first he gat
{{c|Nudos}}, strong and free,
And {{c|Aeros}} of the sea.

{{c|Nudos}} shed his shell
And untwisted as well
Himself from gastropod
{{c|Design}}, and so he trod

A different path than most.
He became the host
Of nudibranches bright:
{{c|Colorful}} sea-sprite

{{c|Slugs}} with poison strong
{{c|Enough}} to sing death's song
To {{c|Leviathan}} great—
Such is their potent fate.

{{c|Aeros}} swam so free
In waters of the sea
Without a care or worry
{{c|Never}} in a hurry

But taking his sweet time
To perfect every rhyme
Of motion through the waves
In ocean's liquid caves.

{{c|Aeros}} bore in time
A son and daughter fine:
{{c|Pulmon}}, strong and great,
And {{c|Angelica}}'s fate

Was to become the mother
Of sea butterflies, and other
{{c|Beautiful}} swimming forms
Through calm and raging storms

Whose ethereal existence
{{c|Eludes}} at every distance
Most who try to see
Their liquid poetry.

Like butterflies of air
But swimming everywhere
Through ocean's liquid space
With otherworldly grace.

But {{c|Pulmon}} the great
Had a different fate.
{{c|Revered}} ancestor he
Did what none could see

Was possible before
From mountain peak to shore:
He inhaled breath of air
And made his body's lair

A lung where he could store
The breath forevermore
That let him survive
The tide pools, stay alive

When water went away
{{c|Throughout}} the changing day
Like none of his kin
Had ever done therein.

From {{c|Gastropus}}' twist
That none could have missed
To {{c|Pulmon}}'s breathing art
That gave him a new start

In evolution's race
Where each must find their place,
The gastropods have shown
How far they've grown

From simple, twisted start
To mastery of art
Both in the sea so deep
And tide pools where they keep

Their vigil night and day
In their devoted way
To life in all its forms
Through calm and raging storms.

In every spiral shell
That stories always tell
Of beauty and of function
{{c|Working}} in conjunction,

Remember how they came
To earn their lasting fame:
Through innovation's art
And tradition's heart

Both working side by side
With ocean as their guide
To fill each living niche
With forms beyond our reach

Of understanding full
But beautiful

To see in all their glory
{{c|Throughout}} life's endless story.

From {{c|Limpets}} holding fast
To rocks that ever last
To sea slugs poison-bright
{{c|Swimming}} day and night,

From money-making shells
To assassins who dwells
Between the life and death
With poison in their breath,

The gastropods show how
{{c|Diversity}} can bow
To no single way
But flourishes each day

In myriad different forms
Through calm and raging storms
That test what each can do
To make their dreams come true.

{{c|Innovation}} and tradition
{{c|Working}} in submission
To life's eternal call
That beckons one and all

To find their perfect place
In evolution's race
Where beauty and function
Meet in perfect junction.
