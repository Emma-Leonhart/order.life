# Chapter 56: The {{c|Settler}} {{c|King}}

*{{c|Arboreus}} divides the world between his sons, establishing the great plant dynasties*

---

## The Great {{c|Division}}

When {{c|Arboreus}}, son of {{c|Tracheus}}, claimed  
His throne among the ancient forest lords,  
He looked upon the lands as yet unnamed  
And spoke these wise and far-resounding words:  

"My sons, the world spreads wide before our sight,  
With fertile valleys, mountains capped with snow,  
Each realm shall serve a different kind of might,  
Each path shall let a different glory grow."  

To {{c|Lycos}} bold he gave the power of spores,
{{c|Released}} like dust upon the waiting wind,
While {{c|Ginkgon}} claimed the leafy, branching shores
Where megaphylls in sunlight would rescind.  

Thus did the settler king divide his realm  
Between two sons to rule with different helm.  

---

## The {{c|Spore}}-{{c|Bearer}}'s {{c|Domain}}

Great {{c|Lycos}} spread his countless spores abroad
Like golden powder dancing on the breeze,
And from those tiny seeds blessed by his {{c|God}}
{{c|Arose}} two sons beneath the ancient trees.

{{c|Isolagos}} the first, who learned to part
His spores 'tween male and female, each their own,
Within his city, built with greatest art,
He raised both sons and daughters fully grown.

{{c|Lycopodion}} the second claimed his right  
To build the first tree ever seen on earth,  
A scale tree reaching up toward the light,  
Of such immense and awe-inspiring girth.  

The club-moss ancestor, his name lives on  
In {{c|Lycopodium}} powder, fire's dawn.  

---

## The {{c|Children}} of {{c|Isolagos}}

From spore-divided {{c|Isolagos}} came
Two sons of vastly different destiny:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Quill}} who sought the underwater fame,
And wise {{c|Sellagine}}, master of the sea.

{{c|Sellagine}}'s children learned to creep and crawl  
Their leaves across the forest floor below,  
In drought they died, but when the rains would fall  
They lived again with resurrection's glow.  

The {{c|Quillworts}} from noble {{c|Quill}} descend,  
Their microphylls reach tall toward the sky,  
No stomata their surfaces defend -  
Through roots they breathe, their spores where waters lie.  

{{c|Underground}} their stems in darkness grow  
While leaves above catch morning's golden glow.  

---

## The {{c|Megaphyll}} {{c|Master}}

But {{c|Ginkgon}} chose a different path to tread:
His leaves branched out in patterns two by two,
{{c|Megaphyllic}} glory crowned his head
As through the forest depths his lineage grew.

From him came forth bold {{c|Phyllon}} as his heir,
Who mastered all the arts of leafy might,
And {{c|Phyllon}}'s sons would spread both far and near  
To claim their kingdoms in the dawning light.  

Two sons had {{c|Phyllon}} in the days of old:
{{c|Pteridos}} the brave, {{c|Gymnos}} the wise,  
Their names in plant lore ever shall be told  
As founders of the kingdoms of the skies.  

From their great loins would spring the fern and tree  
That rule the forest's vast complexity.  

---

## The {{c|Line}} of {{c|Pteridos}}

{{c|Pteridos}} the fern-father had two sons:
{{c|Bold}} {{c|Horsa}} of the puzzlegrass and spear,
And wise {{c|Euspor}}, from whom the lineage runs
Of all the fronds we still hold dear.

From {{c|Horsa}} came great {{c|Equis}}, he who found
{{c|Fair}} {{c|Puzella}} swimming in the stream,  
Their gametophytes merged without a sound  
To birth a dynasty beyond a dream.  

But {{c|Equis}} faced a choice both hard and stark:
Keep megaphylls or join with {{c|Lycos}}' way?  
He chose the path of simple leaves and dark,  
One vein alone would serve him every day.  

In silicon armor he encased his town  
While spores spread far beyond the forest's crown.  

---

## The {{c|Seasonal}} {{c|Cycle}}

{{c|Wise}} {{c|Equis}} learned the rhythm of the year  
And built his kingdom on the wheel of time:  
In spring when snowmelt made the waters clear  
He raised horsetails in patterns sublime.  

No chlorophyll these springtime children bore,  
Just spores released in clouds across the land,  
While through the earth their nutrients they store  
For summer's work by their creator's hand.  

When summer came he tore the horsetails down  
And built puzzlegrass in their sacred place,  
With chlorophyll of green and leafy crown  
To gather sunlight's energizing grace.  

Thus seasons turned in {{c|Equis}}' grand design:  
{{c|Spring}} spores, summer grass, in rhythm fine.  

---

## The {{c|Fern}} {{c|Dynasty}}

From wise {{c|Euspor}} came branches of the tree
That split 'tween {{c|Adderos}} and {{c|Fernando}},  
Each claiming their own realm of destiny  
Where different kinds of fronds would grow.  

{{c|Adderos}} sired {{c|Ophios}} the strange,
Who built but one great leaf of mighty size,
And {{c|Psilos}}, dwelling in the mountain range,
Who needed not leaves beneath the skies.

The adder's-tongue from brave {{c|Ophios}} came,
While whisk ferns trace to {{c|Psilos}} as their sire,  
Each keeping alive their ancestor's name  
Through spore and frond and roots of living fire.  

{{c|Fernando}} spread his fronds in patterns wide
With {{c|Maratton}} standing close beside his side.  

---

## The Great {{c|Swamp}} {{c|Settlement}}

{{c|Maratidus}} and {{c|Leptos}} were the sons
That noble {{c|Maratton}} brought into the world,  
{{c|Ten}} thousand spores the first one always runs  
While hundred spores the second's fronds unfurled.  

{{c|Together}} they became the fern-lords true,  
The ancestors of all the fronds we see,  
From forest floor to canopy of blue  
Their children spread in vast complexity.  

And as these sons of brave {{c|Arboreus}}  
Built swamplands by the {{c|Mississippi}}'s shore,  
They prepared the way, unknowing thus,  
For those who'd walk where none had walked before.  

For here the sons of bold {{c|Osticthus}}  
Would leave the sea and claim the land for us.  

---

## The {{c|Settler}}'s {{c|Legacy}}

Thus did {{c|Arboreus}} the settler king  
{{c|Divide}} the world 'tween spore and megaphyll,  
And from his choice would countless blessings spring  
That serve the forest kingdoms still.  

The club-moss and the fern, the tree so tall,  
The puzzlegrass and horsetails of the spring,  
From his great line they came to rule them all  
And honor their ancestral king.  

Though seasons pass and eras come and go,  
And mighty forests rise and fall to dust,  
The legacy of him who chose to sow  
His kingdom wide remains a sacred trust.  

For in each spore and in each frond unfurled  
{{c|Lives}} on the dream of his divided world.  

---

*Thus did {{c|Arboreus}} establish the great plant dynasties that would rule the forests of the earth, preparing the swamplands where vertebrates would first venture from sea to land.*
