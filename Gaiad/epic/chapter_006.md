Upon the shores of {{c|19|Hesper}}, where waves meet,
{{c|1|Aster}}'s vital force descended from the skies.
Her essence, tholins, seed, a cosmic feat,
The seeds of life in ocean depths arise.

Beneath {{c|278|Tezca}}'s sun, the light warm and bright,
It nourished all the life on {{c|19|Hesper}}'s shore.
Its rays gave strength to creatures in their plight,
A guiding force that helped new life to soar.

Through swirling tides, her power filled the sea,
A gentle glow, life's first soft, pulsing breath.
From self-creation, forms began to be,
{{c|1|Aster}}'s love transcends the void of death.

The seed, her essence, spread across the deep,
Multiplying, and thriving in the dark.
From smallest life to creatures vast, they creep,
Her love and light ignite creation’s spark.

Each wave, a testament to her grand plan,
The birth of life upon this fateful shore.
As microbes crawled, so did the race of man,
Their fragile forms to flourish evermore.
