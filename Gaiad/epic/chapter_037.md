Among the sons of {{c|Cambrius}}
Two faced issues serious:
{{c|Chordatus}}, son of {{c|Dutrus}} true,
And {{c|Annelidus}}, strong through and through.

Each one supported by
{{c|Hydrostatic}} pressure high.
With water pressure in their frame
They bore their body's name.

{{c|Together}} they perceived the flaw:
When movement broke the law
Of circulation through their form,
Their blood could not stay warm.

To nourish organs through their length
They needed greater strength.
So hearts they built with arteries
And veins like flowing seas.

{{c|Together}} each one made with care
{{c|Closed}} systems everywhere.
The blood would flow in circuits true
And nourish organs through.

Our great bloodlines were born that day
When hearts showed them the way.
From hydrostatic to circulatory,
{{c|Evolution}}'s greatest story.

From {{c|Annelon}} came two sons:
{{c|Segmentus}} when day begun
And {{c|Ribbon}}, hunter of the deep
Whose prey would never sleep.

{{c|Ribbon}} built a proboscis long
And venomous and strong.
From this weapon he would hunt
His prey with skillful stunt.

His sons are known today
As {{c|Ribbon}} {{c|Worms}} who slay
Their victims with their poison dart
{{c|Shot}} straight into the heart.

{{c|Segmentus}} built his body wise
With segments that would rise
In number past all count—
Each segment paramount.

He built resilience strong
{{c|Throughout}} his body long.
With countless legs and bristles too
His segments carried through

Their industries with care
And spread them everywhere.
Each segment bore its pair
Of legs beyond compare.

{{c|Segmentus}} bore two sons:
{{c|Pleistos}} when day begun
And {{c|Amphon}} of the sea
Who lived quite happily.

{{c|Amphon}} bore a son and daughter:
{{c|Amphinos}} of the water
And {{c|Sipuncula}} the great
Who chose a different fate.

{{c|Amphinos}} became the sire
Of worms that burn like fire.
{{c|Fierce}} beasts with spikes of poison bright
In colors burning bright.

We never tread upon their ground
Where they can be found.
Their beauty hides their deadly art—
They'll pierce the beating heart.

{{c|Modern}} flags today still show
The colors that bestow
Great honor to {{c|Amphinos}}' line
With patterns so divine.

{{c|Sipuncula}} chose to be
So different and free
That her own phylum she became—
The peanut worms of fame.

{{c|Pleistos}} bore two sons:
{{c|Vermo}} when day begun
And {{c|Errantius}} who roamed
{{c|Far}} from his ancient home.

{{c|Errantius}} bore two more:
{{c|Myzo}} the parasite, and for
{{c|Balance}}, {{c|Greatswimmer}} true
Who swam the ocean blue.

{{c|Greatswimmer}} bore a son and daughter:
{{c|Phyllos}} swift of water
And {{c|Eunice}}, jealous, wild,
{{c|Never}} meek or mild.

{{c|Eunice}} the vicious was
{{c|Jealous}} without cause.
She stole her husband's manhood true
And made herself anew.

Without him she conceived
And daughters she received.
These daughters fierce and bold
Are {{c|Bobbit}} {{c|Worms}} of old.

{{c|Phyllos}} bore sons many
More diverse than any:
{{c|Swimmers}} of artistry
Across the boundless sea.

{{c|Syllides}} the lazy one
{{c|Never}} courted, never won
A mate through his own art—
He'd bud off body part

Each month to chase the maids
While he in comfort stayed.
His lazy ways persist
In every tryst.

{{c|Tomopteris}} breaks his fins
As chaff when race begins.
He swims and never lands
On ocean's shifting sands.

{{c|Alciops}} the hawkeyed hunter
Whose sight is like no other.
His eyes surpass them all
Who hear the ocean's call.

And fair {{c|Aphrodite}}
{{c|Ancestress}} of the sea mice free.
Her daughters beautiful
Make the ocean wonderful.

{{c|Vermo}} bore four daughters fair:
{{c|Eartha}} who walked everywhere,
{{c|Sapion}} wise and true,
{{c|Hestia}} of the deep blue,
And {{c|Orbinida}} of fame
Who earned eternal name.

{{c|Eartha}} walked great distances wide
Across the earth with pride.
Her journeys never ceased
From west unto the east.

{{c|Sapion}} bore two daughters more:
{{c|Sabella}}, who would soar
With feathers bright and fair,
And {{c|Spiona}} everywhere
With tentacles that sway
{{c|Throughout}} the night and day.

{{c|Sabella}}'s daughters live
As fishermen who give
Us beauty in the temple halls—
The feather dusters' calls

{{c|Remind}} us worms can be
Both beautiful and free.
In every sacred place
They show us nature's grace.

{{c|Hestia}} swam down deep
To {{c|Gaia}}'s womb to keep
Her vigil in the dark
Like ancient patriarch.

She closed her gut with care
And bacteria everywhere
Would help her live below
Where others could not go.

Her daughters farm the depths
Where {{c|Gaia}}'s treasure kept:
{{c|Riftia}} in volcanic vents
Where fiery mountain scents

{{c|Fill}} the water hot,
And {{c|Lamella}}'s got
Her home in cold seeps where
{{c|Oil}} riches fill the lair.

{{c|Eartha}} bore a son and daughter:
{{c|Terraclithia}} of the water
And {{c|Echiuron}} so great
With creativity innate.

Like {{c|Sipuncula}} before,
{{c|Echiuron}}'s art and lore
Was so unique and fine
We thought her line divine

{{c|Enough}} to be its own
{{c|Phylum}}, standing alone.
Her creativity
Gave her divinity.

{{c|Terraclithia}} bore two more:
{{c|Terebella}} to explore
And {{c|Clitella}}, wise and small
But mother of them all.

{{c|Terebella}} bore three sons:
{{c|Spaghettes}} when day begun,
{{c|Pompeii}} of the fire,
And {{c|Acros}} to aspire.

{{c|Spaghettes}} used tentacles long
Like ropes both thick and strong
To snare his prey from far—
{{c|Miles}} distant like a star.

{{c|Pompeii}} chose to dwell
In volcanic hell.
Among the fires hot
He made his living spot.

{{c|Acros}} became the sire
Of forms that never tire:
{{c|Squidworm}} and {{c|Swima}} too
{{c|Swam}} the ocean blue.

{{c|Clitella}} was small of head
But wisdom in her spread
Through other organs wise—
Her offspring multiplied

Beyond all counting true.
What bristles never knew
She made up with her spawn:
{{c|Children}} from dusk to dawn.

Her children took to rivers
Where water always quivers.
{{c|Today}} we know them well:
{{c|Earthworms}} who till and tell

The soil of its needs,
And {{c|Leeches}} who feed
On blood from those they meet—
Both bitter and sweet.

From hydrostatic pressure
To circulatory measure,
The worms found their way
To rule both night and day.

In every garden bed
Where earthworms make their tread,
Remember {{c|Annelon}}'s line
That made the system fine.

In every ribbon worm
That makes its victims squirm,
In every feather duster's grace
That beautifies the place,

In every fire worm bright
With colors burning light,
In every deep-sea farmer
{{c|Working}} like a charmer,

The legacy lives on
From dusk until dawn
Of hearts and circulation
That saved each population.

The sons of {{c|Cambrius}} learned
That when their bodies turned
And moved through space and time,
Their blood must flow in rhyme

With needs of every part
From tail unto the heart.
The closed system they made
Will never ever fade.

In every beating heart
That plays its vital part,
Remember those who built
The system without guilt

That pumps our blood each day
In its circulatory way.
From {{c|Chordatus}} and {{c|Annelidus}} true
Came the gift to me and you.
