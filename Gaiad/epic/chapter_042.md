The {{c|Ordovician}} began
With great extinction's plan—
Or did it? {{c|Sages}} still debate
What caused that fearsome fate.

Were these great ghosts real
With power none could feel
Beyond belief so strong,
Or myths that passed along?

The {{c|Sages}} cannot agree
On what they claim to see
In mists of ancient time
Where truth and myth combine.

After the mists cleared
And new dawn appeared,
The world was greater still
{{c|Than}} any mortal will

Could have imagined then.
The {{c|Planktonic}} {{c|Planimals}} when
They fed brought forth new life
Through harmony, not strife.

{{c|Leviathan}} arose,
Great dragon, friend not foes.
{{c|Son}} of wicked king {{c|Magog}},
He ruled through wisdom's log.

Though born of evil seed,
{{c|Leviathan}} would lead
His kingdom not to war
But peace forevermore.

To peaceful prosperity
His realm in clarity
Grew under his wise rule
Like some divine school.

The sons of {{c|Leviathan}}
Grew greater than began
Any before their time:
{{c|Tenscore}} myriads prime

Of microns was their length.
Their body politic's strength
Was great and full of power
Through every passing hour.

His sons inherited
The greatness that was bred
Into their very souls
To play their vital roles.

The sons of {{c|Leviathan}} ruled
The world, and never fooled
By power's corruption,
They brought life's construction

With justice great and true.
They shepherded all who
Were sons of {{c|Bios}} fair
With love and gentle care.

From small planktonic ones
To vicious warrior sons—
The {{c|Anomalocarids}}—
All felt their benefits.

{{c|Ordovices}} the son
Of {{c|Leviathan}} begun
The greatest reign of all
When he would hear the call

To be {{c|Emperor}} supreme.
He built beyond all dream
Great cities of such fame
That "reefs" became their name.

And so economy
Grew in harmony
Like never seen before
From mountain peak to shore.

In great {{c|Coral}} cities
Where beauty never pities
Those who cannot see
Their vast complexity,

The sons of {{c|Euka}} came
From places without name
{{c|Far}} and wide they traveled
As mysteries unraveled.

{{c|Ordovices}} put to work
The sons of {{c|Cnider}} (perk
Of wisdom's gentle hand)
{{c|Throughout}} his peaceful land.

And so the sons of {{c|Anthus}}
Built cities, cantus
Of beauty rising high
Beneath the ocean sky.

{{c|Ordovices}} had daughters
Of {{c|Coraline}} build waters
Into living stone—
She, daughter all her own

Of {{c|Florida}}, who came
From {{c|Rhodes}} of ancient name.
They built coralline {{c|Algae}},
The plaster, galaxy

Upon the great {{c|Corals}}.
Their work through all portals
Of time would long endure
With beauty clean and pure.

{{c|Ordovices}} saw clear
That sons of {{c|Bryos}} here
Had no home to call
Their own, and heard their call.

And so he blessed them well
With homes where they could dwell
Within the great reefs bright
Both day and through the night.

To this day reefs stand
As monuments so grand
Of {{c|Ordovices}}' art
That built with gentle heart

The most prosperous cities
Where life shows no pities
For those who cannot see
Their vast complexity.

On {{c|Terra}} and beyond
These reefs form the bond
Between all living things
That peace and order brings.

The coral cities rise
Beneath the ocean skies
With architecture fine
Both humble and divine.

In every coral branch
And every firm stanch
{{c|Foundation}} built with care
{{c|Lives}} beauty everywhere.

The shoals of fish so bright
{{c|Dance}} in the crystal light
That filters through the reef
Beyond all belief.

Each creature has its place
Within this living space
Where harmony is law
Without the slightest flaw.

The algae and the coral
Live in ways most moral,
Each helping other grow
In partnership's flow.

The {{c|Bryozoans}} small
Build cities, one and all,
Upon the coral's frame
To share in nature's game.

The fish find shelter here
From predators they fear,
While hunters find their prey
{{c|Throughout}} the night and day.

And so economy
Grew in perfect harmony
Under wise {{c|Ordovices}}
Whose rule brought life its prizes.

He became known through time
As "{{c|Ordovices}} the {{c|Prime}}"
Of wisdom, and his boom
{{c|Dispelled}} all sense of doom

That hung over the past
When extinctions last
Had threatened life with death
And stole away its breath.

This boom became the name
Of GOBE—greatest fame
The Great {{c|Ordovician}}
{{c|Event}}, magician

Of biodiversity
That brought complexity
Beyond what was before
To every sea and shore.

The life within the seas
Became what always pleased
The heart that loves to see
{{c|Life}}'s creativity.

More prosperous it grew
With species old and new
{{c|Finding}} their perfect place
In evolution's race.

And it would only grow
{{c|Greater}}, as we know,
More prosperous and bright
Under {{c|Ordovician}} might.

Under the great dynasty
Of wisdom's sovereignty
'{{c|Twas}} the first {{c|Golden}} {{c|Age}}
In life's eternal page.

The reefs became the heart
Of nature's living art
Where beauty and function
Met in perfect junction.

From {{c|Leviathan}}'s wise choice
To let peace be his voice
Instead of war and strife
Came this abundant life.

His son {{c|Ordovices}}
Built cities that are prizes
Still today we see
In reef's complexity.

The coral and the stone,
Each species on its own
Yet working as a whole
To play its vital role,

Show us how to build
{{c|Communities}} that yield
{{c|Prosperity}} for all
Who answer wisdom's call.

In every living reef
Beyond all belief
We see the legacy
Of this great dynasty

That chose to build, not break,
For all life's sake
A world where every creature
Has its special feature

And role to play within
The symphony therein
Of life in all its forms
Through calm and raging storms.

The {{c|Ordovician}} way
{{c|Lives}} on to this day
In every coral city
Both grand and gritty

That rises from the sea
In perfect harmony
Of form and function blessed
By wisdom's gentle rest.

From {{c|Leviathan}}'s peace
To reefs that never cease
To grow in beauty bright,
We see that might

Is not in conquest's sword
But in the gentle word
That builds instead methodically
That tears so wreck systematically.

The first {{c|Golden}} {{c|Age}}
Wrote upon history's page
The lesson clear and true:
That what we choose to do

With power in our hands
{{c|Determines}} if the lands
And seas will flourish well
Or under curses dwell.

{{c|Ordovices}} chose to build
And his wisdom filled
The world with life so bright
It still brings us delight.

In every coral's growth
And every sacred oath
To build and not destroy,
We find life's truest joy.

The Great {{c|Ordovician}}
{{c|Biodiversification}}
{{c|Event}} shows what can come
When wisdom's ways we sum

Into our daily choice
To let peace be our voice
And building be our art
With love within our heart.

The reefs that grow today
In their prosperous way
Are children of that time
When reason was in rhyme

With nature's deepest law:
That beauty without flaw
{{c|Comes}} not from force and might
But from love's gentle sight

That sees in every creature
A perfect, special feature
{{c|Worth}} protecting well
As stories always tell

Of {{c|Leviathan}}'s son
Whose work is never done
As long as reefs still grow
In beauty's endless flow.
