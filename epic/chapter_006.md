Upon the shores of {{c|Hesper}}, where waves meet,
{{c|Aster}}'s vital force descended from the skies.
Her essence, tholins, seed, a cosmic feat,
The seeds of life in ocean depths arise.

Beneath {{c|Tezca}}'s sun, the light warm and bright,
It nourished all the life on {{c|Hesper}}'s shore.
Its rays gave strength to creatures in their plight,
A guiding force that helped new life to soar.

Through swirling tides, her power filled the sea,
A gentle glow, life's first soft, pulsing breath.
From self-creation, forms began to be,
{{c|Aster}}'s love transcends the void of death.

The seed, her essence, spread across the deep,
{{c|Multiplying}}, and thriving in the dark.
From smallest life to creatures vast, they creep,
Her love and light ignite creation’s spark.

Each wave, a testament to her grand plan,
The birth of life upon this fateful shore.
As microbes crawled, so did the race of man,
Their fragile forms to flourish evermore.
