In {{c|Sol}}'s embrace, her daughters came to be,
From nebula, they formed a cosmic host.
{{c|Mercury}}, {{c|Venus}}, {{c|Earth}}, and {{c|Mars}} we see,
With {{c|Ceres}} too, they grace the starry coast.

{{c|Once}} cloaked in waters, {{c|Mercury}} did shine,
But as the {{c|Sun}}'s fierce heat began to rise,
The liquid fled, his surface left benign,
A rocky orb now meets our seeking eyes.

When {{c|Venus}}, struck, began to backward spin,
Her fate was sealed, her path forever turned.
A world of heat and clouds that choke within,
Her beauty veiled by sulfur skies that burned.

Then {{c|Earth}}, fair {{c|Gaia}}, tells her vibrant tale,
From seas arose the life that graced her face.
With mountains high and skies where clouds set sail,
A cradle formed for life's enduring race.

{{c|Mars}}, brother {{c|Mars}}, once water flowed in streams,
His ruddy face now bears a dusty guise.
But as the years passed by, he lost his dreams,
His waters sunk beneath his crimson skies.

Then {{c|Ceres}} slept, her growth was slow to start,
A younger sister, late to join the dance.
Yet beauty dwells within her rocky heart,
A jewel set in space's vast expanse.

The giants vast, the gaseous daughters four,
{{c|Jupiter}}, {{c|Saturn}}, {{c|Uranus}}, {{c|Neptune}}'s reign.
Their tales entwined within the cosmic lore,
With storms that swirl and moons in endless chain.

Around great {{c|Jupiter}}, his moons revolve,
{{c|Io}}, {{c|Europa}}, {{c|Ganymede}}, they dance.
Their icy secrets waiting to evolve,
A celestial show in night's expanse.

But {{c|Io}}'s fires within her heart did glow,
Her waters boiled beneath volcanic flame.
Though some remained in hidden depths below,
A testament to change, she stays the same.

In {{c|Saturn}}'s grasp, her moons of ice reside,
{{c|Enceladus}} and {{c|Titan}} lead the way.
A frozen kin around their mother glide,
In cosmic dance, their fates in balance sway.

Beyond cold {{c|Neptune}} lies a distant field,
{{c|Trans}}-{{c|Neptunian}} worlds in darkness hide.
Their icy secrets yet remain concealed,
A frigid tale where mysteries abide.

{{c|Farther}} still, the {{c|Oort}} {{c|Cloud}} wraps around,
A veil of frozen whispers far from light.
In distant orbits, comets there abound,
A cosmic dance that fades beyond our sight.
