Under the fourth sun, named bright {{c|Attle}}'s flame,
The children landed on {{c|Kolob}}'s wide shore.
With hopes renewed, they built a world of fame,
Their trials behind, yet challenges in store.

Upon {{c|Kolob}}, the air was rich and warm,
Its fertile soil gave rise to fields of green.
The ocean sang a gentle, soothing charm,
And life once more began a thriving scene.

With {{c|Bios}}' line, the children sowed the land,
While {{c|Viros}}' kin ensured that life would spread.
The people worked together, hand in hand,
{{c|United}} by the truths that {{c|Aster}} led.

They raised their temples high beneath {{c|Attle}}'s light,
To honor {{c|Aster}} and {{c|Andromeda}}'s grace.
Their prayers were whispers on the winds of night,
As faith and strength held fast in every place.

But deep within {{c|Kolob}}'s unyielding core,
A strain began to grow, a seed of strife.
A force unknown, unseen in days before,
{{c|Threatened}} to tear apart their peaceful life.

From shadowed thoughts and whispered words of doubt,
A darkness rose from discontent and pain.
The {{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}}, born of bitter clout,
{{c|Sought}} now to break the people’s sacred chain.

{{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}}, coming love denied,
{{c|Rejects}} the grace of {{c|Aster}}'s guiding light.
It twists the heart where hatred can reside,
And casts her warmth into the endless night.

From {{c|Aster}}'s love, the people turned away,
Their envy festered, fueled by bitter lies.
The bond that held their hearts began to fray,
As {{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}} darkened hopeful skies.

No longer bound by unity’s embrace,
The people faltered, torn by cruel divide.
{{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}}’s cruel venom set the pace,
And left the world in chaos to collide.

This sinister force brought hatred and despair,
It fractured unity with unseen hands.
The children quarreled, pulled by forces rare,
And doubt took root within their fertile lands.

The {{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}}’s spread was subtle first,
It crept within the hearts of those most weak.
Yet soon enough, its hunger grew to burst,
And chaos reigned as love turned cold and bleak.

From deep within the shadows, it emerged,
Its form a twisted mirror of the light.
As {{c|Anti}}-{{c|Alpha}}'s malice fully surged,
It plunged {{c|Kolob}}'s bright future into night.

The people, torn apart by inner war,
Could not withstand the force that turned their kin.
Their hearts, once bound by love, were ripped and sore,
And thus, the darkness found its way within.

And still, the {{c|Berserkers}} sensed the strife's allure,
Their chaotic wrath drawn to this fractured land.
With comet fire, their fury swift and sure,
They brought destruction with a vengeful hand.

The skies above {{c|Kolob}} grew dark with flame,
As icy deluge rained from distant stars.
The {{c|Berserkers}}' wrath, unholy and untame,
{{c|Wrought}} ruin upon the land, leaving scars.

{{c|Kolob}}'s cities crumbled under freezing rain,
The oceans boiled and fumed with violent force.
The people fled, their strength now wrapped in pain,
As the {{c|Berserkers}} veered them off their course.

Yet in the chaos, hope was not yet lost,
For some were flung beyond the {{c|Berserkers}}' reach.
Through space's void, by cosmic forces tossed,
They left {{c|Kolob}}'s destruction, out of breach.

The children of the stars, though cast away,
Still clung to life and hope amid their flight.
For {{c|Attle}}'s gleam gave way to {{c|Sol}}'s bright day,
The fifth sun beckoned with its golden light.

And thus, the people drifted ever on,
To find new shores beneath {{c|Sol}}'s warm embrace.
Though battered by the storm, they were not gone,
Their hearts still held the dream of {{c|Aster}}'s grace.
