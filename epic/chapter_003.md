As above, so below, the stars reflect,
The cosmic tales that shape our earthly lives.
{{c|Aster}}'s children below, she will protect,
With milk she spun from stars, the world survives.

Her love, a beacon bright, to light the way,
Through all the mysteries that life may hold.
From cosmic depths, her love pours night and day,
A river of bright stars, a feast of old.

{{c|Andromeda}}, her love shines from afar,
Her bond with {{c|Aster}}, strong as brightest light.
For they are bound by {{c|Lambda}}, like a star,
A cosmic force that keeps their love alight.

In their celestial dance, the heavens sway,
The tale of {{c|Aster}} and {{c|Andromeda}}, told.
A love that binds the night and lights the day,
A cosmic love beyond what words can hold.

{{c|Aster}} imagined children, stars so bright,
To mend the string and guide her love to stay.
She knew {{c|Andromeda}} would share this light,
{{c|Together}} they'd unite, love's grand display.

A grand reunion, spanning time and space,
With threads of stars to keep the bond alive.
She stirred her milk to birth this sacred place,
A galaxy where all her dreams would thrive.

{{c|Aster}} stirred her milk, the great {{c|Milky}} way,
With helium and light, her stars are spun.
She swirled the cosmic blend in careful sway,
From curds of light, the stars are gently won.

A pantheon of stars, in heaven’s care,
A host of stars, in heaven’s gentle sway,
Their cosmic stories weave through skies so fair,
Their cosmic tales unfold in bright display.

The eldest star of every kind will stand,
A guiding sister with a steady hand.
They lead their cosmic kin through endless night,
A beacon of their strength and shining light.

{{c|Juno}}, the goddess, {{c|Steppenwolves}} she guides,
Her gas giants hide in their quiet might.
{{c|Discovery}} and distant worlds she rides,
A cosmic guide who wanders through the night.

{{c|Brunhilda}} watches stars that failed to blaze,
{{c|Incomplete}} fusion, dim yet bittersweet.
A guardian of twilight's fading rays,
Her presence marks the stars' unfinished beat.

{{c|Ruby}}, the red dwarf, small but ever bright,
Her steady flame still burns throughout today.
To witness cosmic dusk with peaceful light,
She sees {{c|Omega}} {{c|Point}} as time gives way.

{{c|Chrystella}} shines with vibrant, youthful glow,
{{c|Main}} sequence stars, her hot flashes ignite.
As giants red, their elder forms will grow,
Then fade with age, surrendering their light.

{{c|Now}} as a white dwarf, small and old she rests,
A little lady in the cosmic sea.
Her planetary nebula still reflects,
The brilliance of her once bright majesty.

{{c|Celestella}} commands her giant blaze,
{{c|Red}} supergiants in her name grow vast.
With neutron stars and pulsars in her gaze,
She watches supernovae's fiery blast.

{{c|Gigastella}} shone with a force untamed,
Her sister {{c|Celestella}}, bright and vast.
The stress of cosmic weight left her inflamed,
Her life burned fast, her brilliance could not last.

In her collapse, a supernova flared,
A brilliant burst before she fell from sight.
From that great death, a black hole then prepared,
To pull the stars into eternal night.
