The sons of {{c|Eurypter}} would
{{c|Usurp}} as no one could
The sons of {{c|Cephalus}}
And rule victorious.

{{c|Eurypter}} married fair
{{c|Pulmona}} everywhere
{{c|Beloved}}, and they'd disagree
On what their name would be.

Each had their own design
For their ancestral line:
"{{c|Eurypterids}}" he'd say,
"{{c|Arachnopulmonates}}" her way.

{{c|Eurypter}} and {{c|Pulmona}}
Bore children like none-a
Other: {{c|Eurypteron}}
And {{c|Styloner}}, begun

In rivalry so deep
That none could ever keep
{{c|Peace}} between the two
Who different paths knew.

{{c|Eurypteron}} and his brother
{{c|Styloner}}, like no other
{{c|Pair}} of siblings fought
For all that could be bought

With power and with might
{{c|Throughout}} the day and night.
When their mother died
They could not decide

Who would inherit all
The world at honor's call.
{{c|Eurypteron}} claimed skies
While {{c|Styloner}}'s eyes

Were set upon the land
Built by his own hand.
And so {{c|Eurypteron}} flew
Across domains he knew

Were his by right of birth
While {{c|Styloner}} walked earth
And claimed each step he took
{{c|According}} to the book

Of inheritance and law
That neither brother saw
The same way as the other
{{c|Despite}} they shared one mother.

The flight of {{c|Eurypteron}}
Across the sky begun
A dynasty of those
Who ruled where wind blows

{{c|High}} above the earth
From moment of their birth
To death's appointed day
They'd rule in their own way.

{{c|Eurypteron}} begat
Two sons: first he begat
{{c|Diploper}} the strong
And {{c|Eurypterus}}, long

In fertility beyond
What any could respond
To with equal measure—
Their numbers were his treasure.

{{c|Eurypterus}} was most
{{c|Fertile}} of the host
Of {{c|Silur}}'s noble sons.
In each generation begun

His house would grow
{{c|Ten}} thousand-fold, and so
His numbers multiplied
Beyond what could be tried

By any other line
In all of space and time.
{{c|Myriad}}-fold they grew
With offspring tried and true.

{{c|Diploper}} begat two:
{{c|Waeringos}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Carcinos}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Waeringos}} begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
{{c|Humiller}}, strong and brave,
And {{c|Adelops}}, who'd save

His line through numbers vast
That would forever last.
{{c|Adelops}} was small
But answered duty's call

With many children who
Were resilient and true,
Like bugs beneath the sea
In their tenacity.

{{c|Humiller}} married fair
{{c|Pterra}}, beyond compare
In beauty and in grace,
And in their dwelling place

{{c|Together}} they bore one
{{c|Son}} when day begun:
{{c|Slender}}, fast, and sly,
Who'd rule beneath the sky

And in the depths below.
They named him {{c|Slimon}}, though
His destiny was great
Beyond what they could state.

{{c|Slimon}} bore a son
Whose work, when it was done,
Would show the massive claws
That grew according to laws

Of nature from his mouth.
From north down to the south
His power would be known
When he had grown.

He named this son at first
{{c|Clawbert}}, but then burst
A strike of lightning bright
That filled the world with sight.

And {{c|Slimon}} took the sign
From powers divine
And changed his son's name
To {{c|Pterygo}}'s fame.

The sons of {{c|Pterygo}}
Were rulers high and low
Of all {{c|Eurypterids}}.
{{c|Fast}}, strong, their power bids

The world to bow before
Their might from shore to shore.
{{c|Regal}} in their way,
They ruled both night and day.

His youngest son was one
Called {{c|Scorpio}}, begun
As explorer of the new,
With vision clear and true.

{{c|Scorpio}} saw no land
Left for his command,
For all his brothers older
Had claimed, and none bolder

Could challenge their right
To rule with all their might
The territories vast
That they held firmly fast.

And so {{c|Scorpio}} looked
Up from his watery nook
Out of the sea to land
Built by no one's hand

But waiting to be claimed
By one who could be named
The first to make the leap
From waters dark and deep.

{{c|Scorpio}} ventured up
Like warrior with cup
Of courage in his heart
To play the pioneer's part.

His book gills became
{{c|Book}} lungs, and his name
Would live forevermore
From mountain peak to shore.

He claimed all lands of might
{{c|Euramerica}} in sight
For himself and his line
By right of the divine

Who favors those who dare
To venture everywhere
That none have gone before
To open up the door

Of possibility
For all humanity
And every living thing
That answers life's ring.

His sons are known today
As scorpions in their way,
Still carrying the torch
Of those who scorch

{{c|New}} paths through virgin land
Built by their own hand
From nothing into all
That answers courage's call.

{{c|Styloner}} married then
{{c|Rhena}}, and the pen
Of fate would write their names
In evolution's games.

{{c|Together}} they bore two:
{{c|Makoko}}, tried and true,
And {{c|Stylonurus}} strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Makoko}} begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
{{c|Mycter}} and {{c|Kokomo}},
Each destined high to go.

{{c|Mycter}} begat two more:
{{c|Flumon}} to explore
And {{c|Drepan}}, strong and true,
Who different pathways knew.

{{c|Flumon}} found no luck
In seas where he was stuck
With brothers and with cousins
Who by the dozens

Had claimed the seas for their
{{c|Own}} use, and would not share
With him a single place
To call his dwelling space.

So he searched rivers wide
With current as his guide
To find what he could claim
For his ancestral name.

{{c|Flumon}} begat two sons:
{{c|Hibbert}} when day begun
And {{c|Mycterops}} the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

{{c|Hibbert}} was a great
{{c|River}} dweller whose fate
Was to be tough and large,
And he would take charge

Of all the river's course
With wisdom and with force.
{{c|Larger}}, tougher than
Any other man

Of his time, he survived
{{c|Tragedies}} and thrived
Through countless trials
Across thousands of miles.

His people were a race
{{c|Resilient}} in their place,
{{c|Powerful}} and old,
With stories yet untold

Of how they overcame
{{c|Whatever}} brought them shame
Or tried to break their will
Upon the river's sill.

{{c|Mycterops}} was strong
And versatile life long.
His two sons would continue
The work he would begin to

Do: living in the rivers
Where water always shivers
With life and searching for
{{c|Food}} from shore to shore

In most unlikely places
Where none could see their faces
But they would always find
What fed both heart and mind.

{{c|Megarachne}} and his brother
{{c|Minirachne}}, like no other
{{c|Pair}} ruled rivers wide
With power and with pride.

{{c|Sons}} of {{c|Mycterops}},
They were the tops
Of river royalty
In their dynasty.

But {{c|Minirachne}} was not
{{c|Satisfied}} with his lot
In rivers flowing free—
He wanted more to see.

{{c|Scorpio}} and {{c|Minirachne}}
Were always destined, see,
To fight for the same prize:
The land beneath the skies.

For both had more ambition
{{c|Than}} any opposition
Could contain or tame
In their quest for fame.

Both were men whose dreams
{{c|Surpassed}} all that seems
{{c|Possible}} to those
Who seek repose

In comfort and in ease
But never feel the breeze
Of challenge call their name
To play a greater game.

{{c|Minirachne}} climbed up high
Beneath the open sky
With {{c|Tetra}}, his fair wife,
To start a new life

In the world of land
Built by their own hand,
Where none had gone before
To open up the door.

His book lungs became
{{c|Book}} gills, and his name
Would be remembered long
In evolution's song.

He came to conquer all
The lands where {{c|Scorpio}}'s call
Had claimed the territory
For his own story.

And so the stage was set
For a conflict yet
{{c|Unseen}} in all the world
Where banners were unfurled

Between two mighty lines
With their different designs
On what the world should be
For all eternity.

From {{c|Eurypter}}'s marriage
To {{c|Pulmona}}'s carriage
Of their children into being
Came this foreseeing

Of conflict yet to come
When all would be done
And winners would be crowned
And losers would be found.

The sons of {{c|Eurypter}}
Would rise like {{c|Jupiter}}
Above all other lines
With their grand designs

To rule both sea and land
Built by their own hand
Through courage and through might
That shines like morning light.

From river to the sea,
From sea to land so free,
The eurypterids show
How ambitions grow

From small beginnings made
By those who are not afraid
To venture into spaces
Where none have shown their faces.

But also shows the cost
When some lines are lost
In conflict with their kin
That no one ever wins.

The rivalry between
{{c|Brothers}} who have seen
{{c|Different}} paths to take
For their own sake

And their children's future
{{c|Shows}} how nature's suture
{{c|Often}} cannot hold
When ambitions grow bold

Beyond what can be shared
By those who never cared
To find a peaceful way
To live from day to day.

From {{c|Scorpio}}'s bold climb
To {{c|Minirachne}}'s time
Of conquest and of war,
The lesson from of lore

Is clear for all to see:
{{c|Ambition}} must be free
But also must be wise
Beneath the starry skies.

The world is big enough
For all who are tough
{{c|Enough}} to make their way
Through each and every day

Of challenge and of strife
In this eternal life
Where all must find their place
In evolution's race.

But when ambition turns
To conflict, and it burns
The bridges that connect
Those who should protect

Each other as they grow
Through all they'll ever know
Of joy and pain and love
Beneath the stars above,

Then all become the losers
In the games that choosers
Play when they forget
That none can ever get

All they want alone
Without the seeds they've sown
Of cooperation true
With me and you.

The eurypterids' rise
{{c|Shows}} us to be wise
In how we use our power
In each and every hour

Of our living days
Along our mortal ways
Where choice determines all
Who answer life's great call.

From {{c|Eurypter}}'s flight
To {{c|Scorpio}}'s sight
Of lands beyond the sea
Where he could be

The first to make his mark
Upon a world so dark
With possibility
For all humanity,

The lesson clear as day
{{c|Shows}} us the way
To be both brave and wise
Beneath the starry skies

Where all our dreams can grow
If we but choose to sow
The seeds of peace and love
{{c|Blessed}} from above

In every choice we make
For everyone's sake
Who shares this world with us
In ways both glorious

And challenging to see
For you and me
Who must decide each day
Which path we'll take away.

The sons of {{c|Eurypter}}
Like shining {{c|Jupiter}}
Rose high above the rest
And passed each mortal test

Through courage, wisdom, might,
And inner sight
That saw what could be done
Beneath the shining sun

If only they would dare
To venture everywhere
That none had gone before
To open up the door

Of possibility
For all eternity
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you today.
