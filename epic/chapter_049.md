While sons of {{c|Cambrius}} flourished well
In seas where they would dwell,
The sons of {{c|Symbio-Mygus}}
And daughters of {{c|Charina-Plantus}}

{{c|Pushed}} frontiers far and wide
Across the world's divide.
But soon they faced
{{c|Competition}} in their place.

For {{c|Euthy}}, daughter brave
Of {{c|Mandibulus}}, who gave
Her all to save her young,
Was being chased among

The waters by her foe:
{{c|Anomalocaris}}, who'd show
No mercy in his chase
Across that watery space.

Her precious eggs needed care
And protection everywhere.
So she did what she must—
In {{c|Hausa}} placed her trust.

She jumped through shimmering sky
Up rocks that reached so high
To heavens bright above,
{{c|Protecting}} those she'd love.

And so she burst from sea
Onto the land so free.
The first to make that leap
From waters dark and deep.

Upon the ground she fell,
{{c|Suffocating}} well
In air so thin and strange,
{{c|Throughout}} that foreign range.

But she and husband true
{{c|Protected}} eggs they knew
Must live until the end—
Their legacy to send.

Among brave {{c|Euthy}}'s daughters
Who left the ancient waters
Was {{c|Myry}} the trepanated,
By circumstance created.

Like sisters she was born
But water made her mourn—
She suffocated there
In ocean's liquid lair.

Her father, seeing this,
{{c|Pierced}} holes he would not miss
Above her ten thousand legs
Where breathing never begs.

Through these holes she was free
To receive directly
{{c|Hausa}}'s blessings pure
Into her frame so sure.

Her descendants to this day
Still breathe in this way.
The holes that saved her life
Cut through terrestrial strife.

And so the daughters all
Of {{c|Myry}} heard the call
To breathe the air so sweet—
The {{c|Myriapods}} complete.

{{c|Myry}} the pierced explored
The new lands she adored.
She found she wasn't lone
Upon this earthly zone.

{{c|Tradition}} names this place
"{{c|Myry}}'s coast" in grace,
But she was not the first—
{{c|History}}'s truth rehearsed

{{c|Now}} calls it "{{c|Coast}} of Three
{{c|Kingdoms}}" truthfully
To honor every side
Of history's great tide.

{{c|Myry}} saw with wonder
{{c|Cities}} torn asunder
By neither rain nor thunder:
{{c|Lichen}} cities, born

Of covenant between
{{c|Symbio-Mygus}}, seen
With {{c|Charina-Planta}}'s line—
{{c|Partnership}} divine.

{{c|Sprawling}} cities wide
Half mold and moss beside
Each other living well:
{{c|Mycelium}} would delve

{{c|Deep}} down to earthly gold
While thallus, brave and bold,
{{c|Basked}} in the sun's bright blessing
From heaven's light caressing.

These cities spread so far
Beneath each shining star.
When cities met they'd marry—
Both fungi and plant carried

On their ancient vow
To live together now.
Each nation wed the other
Like sister and like brother.

But {{c|Myry}} was not gentle
In her ways elemental.
She ate the cities whole
And stole what made them whole.

But as she ran around
She dropped on fertile ground
{{c|Cells}} scattered everywhere
{{c|Throughout}} the atmosphere.

Across the globe they fell,
Her messy eating spell
Left pieces of her meal
For others to steal.

{{c|Soon}} sons of {{c|Mygus}} built
{{c|Cities}} without guilt
With daughters of {{c|Charina}}
Across each earthly arena.

But {{c|Myry}} bore two sons:
{{c|Cain}} when day begun
And {{c|Abel}}, gentle, mild,
Her peaceful, loving child.

In process of time came
When each would bring by name
An offering so true
To {{c|Mithra}}'s judgment due.

{{c|Cain}} brought the fruit
Of ground beneath his foot.
{{c|Abel}} brought the best
Of flocks that he possessed.

And {{c|Mithra}} had respect
For {{c|Abel}}'s offering, blessed
His sacrifice so true,
But {{c|Cain}}'s he did eschew.

Then {{c|Cain}} was wroth and fell
His countenance, unwell.
The {{c|Lord}} said unto {{c|Cain}}:
"Why is thy heart in pain?

If thou doest well,
{{c|Shalt}} thou not excel?
But if thou doest wrong,
{{c|Sin}}'s desire is strong."

But {{c|Cain}} talked with {{c|Abel}}
His brother at their table.
And when they were alone
{{c|Cain}}'s hatred had grown.

In field he rose against
His brother, and dispensed
With {{c|Abel}}'s gentle life—
{{c|Murder}}'s sharpened knife.

And {{c|Mithra}} called to {{c|Cain}}:
"Where is thy brother slain?"
"I know not," {{c|Cain}} replied,
"Am I to be his guide?"

"What hast thou done today?
{{c|Thy}} brother's blood doth pray
From ground where he was killed—
{{c|Thy}} curse shall be fulfilled.

No more shall ground give strength
To thee through all thy length
Of days upon this earth—
A wanderer from thy birth."

Then {{c|Cain}} cried out in fear:
"My punishment too dear!
From earth and thee I'm driven,
No rest to me is given.

A fugitive I'll be,
And whosoever shall see
Me wandering shall slay—
I cannot get away."

But {{c|Mithra}} marked him well:
"{{c|Whoever}} thee shall fell,
{{c|Sevenfold}} vengeance shall
Upon that person fall."

And {{c|Cain}} went forth in shame
To land of {{c|Nod}} by name,
{{c|East}} of {{c|Eden}}'s gate
To meet his chosen fate.

There {{c|Cain}} knew his wife
And built a city-life.
She bore him {{c|Centipus}},
{{c|Son}} glorious.

The city bore the name
Of {{c|Centipus}}' fame.
And {{c|Cain}} became ancestor
Of {{c|Caintipedes}}, predecessor

({{c|Misspelled}} by {{c|Romans}} old
As "centipedes," we're told)
Who hunt with poison bite
{{c|Throughout}} the day and night.

But {{c|Abel}}'s gentle wife
Was heavy with new life
When {{c|Cain}}'s rage tore apart
Her husband's gentle heart.

In million pieces small
{{c|Abel}}'s body fell.
His wife, with child blessed,
Became ancestress

Of millipedes so mild
Who harm not beast or child
But eat the leaves that fall
And decompose them all.

{{c|Enraged}} at {{c|Abel}}'s death
{{c|Myry}} drew her breath
And lunged at {{c|Cain}} with might—
They fought their final fight.

Both passed to {{c|Ghedos}}' realm
Where death holds the helm.
But in their corpses lay
{{c|Seeds}} for another day.

In death, {{c|Mygus}}' sons
Took revenge for wrongs done.
{{c|Hera}}, daughter true,
And {{c|Freyr}}, strong through and through,

In twentieth generation
Found habitation
Within the corpses cold
Of stories that were told.

As they grew within
They built cities therein.
Their hyphae met at last
When growing time had passed.

When they met they wed
But heard what {{c|Mithra}} said:
"O couple great and true,
{{c|Prosperity}}'s with you.

But barren you shall be
For decades, wait and see.
{{c|Postpone}} your marriage-bed
Until I give word instead.

When children you shall bear
They'll multiply everywhere
And fill the earth with life
As husband and as wife."

They followed his command
And through the fertile land
They married cells alone,
Not nuclei their own.

Each cell was shared by two,
Each nucleus lived through
In every cell they made—
Their sacrifice well-paid.

{{c|Dikaryotic}} cells
Their story always tells
Of patience and of love
{{c|Blessed}} from above.

{{c|Decades}} they waited long
{{c|Decomposing}} strong
The daughters of {{c|Myry}}—
Their patient ministry.

They became ancestors
Of high fungi, processors
Of death into new life:
{{c|Mushrooms}} and knife

Of penicillin's power
To heal in darkest hour.
The great fungi arose
From where their love chose

To wait for {{c|Mithra}}'s word
And let their love be heard
Through patience in the ground
Where wisdom could be found.

Among great {{c|Plantus}}' sons
Who stayed when day begun
With sons of {{c|Mygus}} were
Two brothers everywhere:

{{c|Stomatos}} and {{c|Hepatos}},
Who chose their separate ways.
{{c|Connected}} to network
Of cells that always work

At cellular level
They built partnership's revel
With sons of {{c|Glomulus}}
So glorious.

{{c|Stomatos}} saw the holes
In {{c|Myry}}'s sides and souls.
He pierced himself as well
To breathe and to excel.

But {{c|Hepatos}} refused
The foreign magic, used
His ancient ways instead
And kept his faithful tread.

{{c|Hepatos}} became the sire
Of {{c|Liverworts}}' choir
Who keep the ancient way
Until this very day.

But {{c|Stomatos}} became
{{c|Ancestor}} of fame
Of all other plants
Who dance their living dance.

{{c|Today}} we honor him
As {{c|Eloh}}, not dim
But bright transhumanist
Who never would desist

From being better still
Through strength of mind and will.
When beliefs must change
He'd rearrange

His understanding true
To make his vision new.
{{c|Always}} growing more
{{c|Than}} he had been before.

As sons of {{c|Stomatos}}
Rose like kratos
{{c|Hillu}} struck back in rage
Upon that earthly stage.

So many lineages
Through all their pilgrimages
Would be lost forever more
On that primeval shore.

The {{c|Coast}} of Three {{c|Kingdoms}}
Where life's great wisdom
First met upon the land
By {{c|Mithra}}'s guiding hand.

{{c|Plant}} and fungi wed
While arthropods were fed
On both their partnership—
The first tri-partnership.

From sea to land they came,
Each seeking their own fame.
But partnership proved best
Above all the rest.

The lichen cities showed
How love's seeds could be sowed
Between the most unlike
To share each other's hike

Through life upon the earth
Where partnership gives birth
To beauty none could see
In isolation's spree.

From {{c|Euthy}}'s desperate leap
To save her children deep
Came {{c|Myry}}'s pierced way
Of breathing every day.

From {{c|Cain}} and {{c|Abel}}'s strife
Came death and new life:
{{c|Centipedes}} who hunt
And millipedes who shunt

{{c|Decay}} into rich earth
For new plants' birth.
From fungi's patient love
{{c|Blessed}} from above

Came mushrooms' mighty power
In earth's darkest hour.
From {{c|Stomatos}}' brave change
Came plants' wide range.

The {{c|Coast}} of Three {{c|Kingdoms}}
{{c|Shows}} how life's wisdom
{{c|Finds}} its truest way
Through partnership's display.
