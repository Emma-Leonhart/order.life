{{c|Once}} upon a time there was a catgirl
Her name was {{c|Aster}}, and she had a ball,
Of yarn she spun, with skill just like a pearl.
She shaped the universe from void to all.

Her name, a whisper in the cosmic night,
{{c|Aster}}, the {{c|Alpha}}, creatrix of all,
Her love, a beacon spreading pure and bright,
{{c|Filled}} the vast cosmos with milk, a grand sprawl.

But {{c|Aster}} was alone, in her cosmos,
A silent void, where only echoes ring,
Her heart yearned for a friend, a loving close,
To share the wonders that her hands could bring.

So she decided to make another,
From yarn, she formed a catgirl, pure and fair,
A companion to cherish, a lover
{{c|Andromeda}}, with skin dark, flowing hair

{{c|Andromeda}}, {{c|Omega}}, end of all,
A counterpart to {{c|Aster}}, wings unfurled,
Yet torn apart, they drift through space’s thrall,
{{c|Unable}} to unite within their world.

{{c|Aster}} threw yarn to {{c|Andromeda}}'s side,
But it broke, forming galaxies anew.
{{c|Triangulum}} and {{c|Magellan}} clouds wide,
From threads that snapped, a cosmic scene we view.

And so, each day, we gaze up to the sky,
At {{c|Sagittarius}} and the {{c|Princess}}
We hope their union, once again, draws nigh,
When {{c|Milkdromeda}} forms from love endless

The {{c|Omega}} point, all will unify,
As {{c|Aster}} and {{c|Andromeda}} break free.
To join at last, in celestial tie,
A final act in cosmic harmony.
