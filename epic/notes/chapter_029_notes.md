# Chapter 029 Notes: First Ice Age Begins
*Capricorn 3 - Chapter 29 of 364*

## Chapter Content Summary
This chapter narrates the evolution of symbiotic relationships through the marriage of Symbio-Mygus (fungus) and Charina-Planta (algae), creating lichens and mycorrhizal networks. It details various lichen types and culminates in the formation of the Wood Wide Web fungal network, connecting this biological innovation to the beginning of the Cryogenian ice age.

## Main Characters and Lineages
### The Primary Union
- **Symbio-Mygus**: "Fungal lord," tenth generation from Zygos
- **Charina-Planta**: "Daughter of photosynthetic light," tenth from Charina's algae clan
- **Marriage Location**: Lichen Lake, representing aquatic symbiotic origin

### Secondary Partnerships
- **Trentophila**: Second bride of Symbio-Mygus, "daughter fair of Trent"
- **Amber + Arbusculus**: Creating terrestrial plant-fungal partnerships
- **Ashley + Wort**: Plant ancestors establishing land colonization
- **Glomer**: Brother creating mycorrhizal networks
