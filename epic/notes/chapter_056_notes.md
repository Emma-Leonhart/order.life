# Chapter 56 Notes: The Settler King

## Arboreus and the Great Plant Division

### The Settler King's Decree
- **Arboreus** (son of Tracheus) - claimed throne among ancient forest lords
- **Divided the world** between his sons for different kinds of plant dominance
- **"Each realm shall serve a different kind of might, each path shall let a different glory grow"**

### The Two Great Plant Strategies
- **Lycos** - given power of **spores** released like dust on wind
- **Ginkgon** - claimed **leafy, branching shores** with **megaphylls** in sunlight

## The Spore-Bearer's Domain (Lycos Line)

### Lycos' Great Innovation
- **Spread countless spores** like golden powder on breeze
- **Two sons** arose from his spore strategy

#### Isolagos the Separator
- **Learned to part spores** between **male and female**
- **Built cities** with sons and daughters fully grown
- **Spore sexual differentiation** innovation

#### Lycopodion the Tree Builder
- **Built first tree** ever seen on earth
- **Scale tree** reaching toward light
- **Immense, awe-inspiring girth**
- **Club-moss ancestor** - **Lycopodium powder** (fire's dawn)

## The Children of Isolagos

### Isolagos' Two Sons
- **Quill** - sought underwater fame
- **Sellagine** - master of the sea

#### Sellagine's Resurrection Strategy
- **Children learned to creep and crawl** across forest floor
- **Drought death** but **resurrection with rains**
- **Resurrection plants** that survive desiccation

#### Quill's Aquatic Adaptation
- **Quillworts** descendants
- **Microphylls** reaching toward sky
- **No stomata** - breathe through roots
- **Spores in water**
- **Underground stems**, leaves catch morning light

## The Megaphyll Master (Ginkgon Line)

### Ginkgon's Innovation
- **Different path** from spore-bearers
- **Leaves branched in patterns two by two**
- **Megaphyllic glory** - large, complex leaves
- **Forest depth expansion**

#### Phyllon the Leaf Master
- **Ginkgon's heir**, mastered **arts of leafy might**
- **Two sons**: **Pteridos** (brave) and **Gymnos** (wise)
- **Founders of kingdoms of the skies**
- **Fern and tree** lineages

## The Line of Pteridos (Ferns)

### Pteridos the Fern-Father
- **Two sons**: **Horsa** (puzzlegrass and spear) and **Euspor** 
- **Euspor** - lineage of **all fronds we still hold dear**

## Major Evolutionary Innovations

### Reproductive Strategies
- **Spore dispersal** (wind-borne golden powder)
- **Sexual differentiation** in spores (male/female separation)
- **Aquatic spore release** (Quillworts)

### Leaf Evolution
- **Megaphylls** vs. **microphylls** (large vs. small leaves)
- **Branching patterns** (two by two)
- **Stomatal elimination** in aquatic forms

### Habitat Adaptations
- **Terrestrial trees** (Lycopodion's scale trees)
- **Aquatic specialization** (Quillworts)
- **Desiccation tolerance** (resurrection plants)
- **Forest floor colonization** (creeping forms)

### Physiological Innovations
- **Root respiration** instead of stomatal breathing
- **Underground storage** organs
- **Drought survival** and resurrection abilities

## Biological Connections
- **Lycophytes** - club mosses, scale trees, quillworts
- **Megaphylls** - true leaves with branching veins (ferns, seed plants)  
- **Microphylls** - small leaves with single veins (lycophytes)
- **Carboniferous forests** - dominated by giant lycophyte trees
- **Lycopodium** spores - used historically as flash powder
- **Selaginella** - resurrection plants, some desiccation-tolerant
- **Isoetes** (Quillworts) - aquatic lycophytes with no stomata
- **Pteridophytes** - ferns and fern allies

## Major Themes

### Territorial Division
- **Kingdom establishment** through geographic and ecological partitioning
- **Different strategies** for different environments
- **Royal inheritance** determining evolutionary paths

### Innovation vs. Tradition  
- **Spore innovations** (male/female separation, dispersal strategies)
- **Leaf complexity** evolution (micro to megaphylls)
- **Adaptive radiation** from basic plant forms

### Habitat Mastery
- **Terrestrial dominance** (forest trees)
- **Aquatic specialization** (underwater breathing, spore release)
- **Extremophile adaptations** (drought tolerance, resurrection)

### Reproductive Revolution
- **Sexual differentiation** in plant reproduction
- **Dispersal mechanisms** (wind, water)
- **Habitat-specific** reproductive strategies

The chapter establishes the major plant lineages and their fundamental innovations during the early terrestrial plant radiation, with particular focus on reproductive strategies and leaf evolution that enabled plant dominance of terrestrial ecosystems.
