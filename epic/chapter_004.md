The tale of {{c|Rhodes}} and {{c|Marigold}} begins,
A union forged in stars, their love so bright.
The first of lovers bound, their fate still spins,
A cosmic dance that guides us through the night.

{{c|Rhodes}}, son of {{c|Ruby}}, dim with crimson glow,
And {{c|Marigold}}, of {{c|Chrystella}}'s bright line,
Were joined in love, the stars watched from below,
The first celestial bond, forever fine.

Their love was strong, unwavering and true,
Though {{c|Marigold}} was bright, a shining flame,
While {{c|Rhodes}}, much smaller, dim in ruby hue,
Yet still their hearts burned with a single name.

As years passed on, {{c|Marigold}}'s light grew red,
Her youthful glow now fading into age.
She gave her breath to {{c|Rhodes}}, who soared ahead,
And shone with yellow light, her bright young stage.

As {{c|Marigold}} grew small, her light turned white,
Yet {{c|Rhodes}} stayed close, his glow now burning red.
From novas born, came lithium's bright light,
A starry gift, as love between them spread.

The nova's burst had filled his heart with fear,
So {{c|Rhodes}} withheld his gift for many years.
For twenty-five, the skies stayed calm and clear,
Until again, their love burst forth with cheers.

For countless years, their rhythm stayed the same,
Each nova lighting skies with love’s great might.
{{c|Once}} every age, their gift became a flame,
A cycle known as {{c|Nova}}’s sacred light.

As time went on, they both grew small and white,
Yet side by side, they watched the stars they made.
Their children shining in the nebula’s light,
A legacy of love that would not fade.

And now, we honor them in wedding vows,
With ruby rings for one, and topaz bright.
{{c|White}} opal marks the bond that time allows,
A symbol of their love’s enduring light.
