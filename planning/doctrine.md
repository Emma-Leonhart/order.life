# Lifeism Doctrine (Source Content)

## Core Identity
**Lifeism** (命道教 / Order of Life): a religion of universal flourishing, negative theology polytheism, and the moral horizon of immortality.

## Doctrinal Summary
Lifeism is a religion of life's sacredness: a commitment to expand agency, reduce involuntary suffering, and build a civilization worthy of minds. It practices a negative-theology polytheism -- many divine names for irreducible sacred dimensions, held with humility and without authoritarian certainty. Its moral horizon is universal immortality: a future where continued existence is available to all who want it, protected by justice, consent, and governance. Lifeism treats science and technology as sacred tools and spiritual responsibilities, and it treats truthfulness, compassion, and anti-coercion safeguards as core religious disciplines.

## 1) What Lifeism Is
Life is the primary value, and the work of intelligence is to expand life's freedom, depth, continuity, and possibility.

Lifeism treats the universe as a stage on which life can either be constrained (by suffering, scarcity, ignorance, coercion, death) or liberated (through knowledge, compassion, technology, governance, and spiritual maturity).

It is simultaneously:
- A moral project: reducing involuntary suffering, expanding autonomy
- A metaphysical stance: reality is deeper than any single description; the sacred is real but not capturable
- A practical program: institutions, tools, and technologies designed to promote life's continuity and freedom
- A spiritual discipline: cultivating honesty, reverence, and responsibility

## 2) Core Commitments
- The Primacy of Life: Life is the locus of value
- Agency as Sacred: the power of a being to steer itself, to consent, to refuse, to grow
- Compassion is the Default: reducing involuntary suffering and expanding options of others
- Truthfulness as Spiritual Discipline: epistemic integrity as sacred practice
- Civilization as Moral Technology: institutions evaluated by their effect on life's freedom
- The Moral Horizon: Universal Immortality -- death is not holy, mortality is not a moral ideal

## 3) Negative Theology Polytheism
- Negative theology: the ultimate nature of reality cannot be fully captured by human concepts
- Polytheism: reality presents itself as many sacred dimensions (life/death, order/chaos, creativity/entropy, love/boundary, etc.)
- Gods can be understood as mythic-personal, philosophical, cognitive-symbolic, or metaphysical-agnostic
- No deity is fully definable, fully representable, licenses cruelty, or serves as unquestionable trump card

## 4) Ethics
- Consent and autonomy are foundational
- Suffering is a problem to solve, not a virtue to romanticize
- Justice as the protection of persons across time, cultures, species, and future forms of mind
- The right to continue existing is a morally serious claim

## 5) Universal Immortality
- Long-term civilizational goal of making continued existence available to all who want it
- Must be universal (selective immortality for elites would be a moral catastrophe)
- Pluralist about implementation: biological longevity, cybernetic augmentation, advanced medicine, safer environments, better governance
- Immortality as compassion, not vanity
- Requires governance, equity, and anti-authoritarianism
- Principle of voluntary exit protected

## 6) Practice
- Vows: protect agency, cultivate truthfulness, reduce harm, build flourishing, treat death as an enemy
- Devotional attention: gratitude, mourning, reverence, commitment, contemplation
- Rituals: remembrance rites, vow-renewal, seasonal rites, consecration of tools
- Sacred art encodes: continuity, agency, multiplicity, the sacred unknown, horizon of immortality
