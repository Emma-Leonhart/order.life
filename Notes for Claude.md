Hopefully you will reactivate automatically at 11:00 AM, I am not sure if you have that capability or not properly, but I undid a lot of commits, This was just to unbreak the calendar and you should overwrite them with the new stuff you made locally

look over settings.local.json to make sure there's no secret leakage and check both this file and the other one (copilot and claude ones) delete both once finished
