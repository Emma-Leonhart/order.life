# Hallowings of the Realms

## Project Overview
This project aims to create modern "Hallowings" - a translation of the Japanese term "Fudoki" (風土記) - for all first-level administrative subdivisions of countries worldwide.

### What is a Fudoki?
Fudoki were ancient Japanese geographical and cultural records compiled in the 8th century, documenting:
- Local geography and natural features
- Etymology of place names
- Local legends and folklore
- Products and resources
- Historical events and notable figures

### Project Goal
Create comprehensive regional cultural-geographical records for modern administrative divisions, following the spirit of the original Fudoki.
