The Realm of Shimane is a realm in Japan.

Izumo Province was one of the most important areas of Japan. Much of the Kojiki is in Izumo. 

Right — modern Shimane Prefecture is mostly made up of the old Iwami, Izumo, and Oki Provinces, so when you look at its ancient and historical highlights, you can break them down by these former provinces:

⸻

1. Iwami Province (western Shimane)
	•	Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine – Probably the most famous site from Iwami. It’s a 16th–17th century silver mine, now UNESCO World Heritage, but the area also has older settlements.
	•	Kofun clusters – Like the Shimane Kofun group, showing early elite presence in the region.
	•	Coastal trade points – Archaeology shows activity from Yayoi through Nara/Heian times, with Iwami connected to the Sea of Japan trade routes.

⸻

2. Izumo Province (central/eastern Shimane)
	•	Izumo Taisha – One of the oldest and most important Shinto shrines in Japan, linked to creation myths and the Izumo myth cycle.
	•	Kofun burial mounds – Large keyhole-shaped tombs, indicating a powerful local elite in ancient times.
	•	Ancient temples – Archaeological traces of Buddhist temples from Hakuho/Nara periods.
	•	Izumo Plain settlements – Fertile land supported more population than surrounding mountains, making it a regional cultural center.

⸻

3. Oki Province (islands north of Shimane)
	•	Island fortifications and shrines – Sparse population, but significant Shinto and early defensive structures.
	•	Exile sites in later periods – While this is post-Heian, the Oki Islands became famous as places of political exile, which preserved some older cultural features.

⸻

Summary
	•	Shimane = Iwami + Izumo + Oki, but historically Izumo was the cultural heart, Iwami had mining and trade, and Oki was marginal but strategically important.
	•	Relative population in the Heian to Meiji period: Izumo had the most density, Iwami and Oki were more peripheral and sparsely populated.

If you want, I can make a map showing Hōki/Inaba for Tottori and Iwami/Izumo/Oki for Shimane, marking ancient settlements, kofun, and shrines, so you can see visually why these provinces were culturally important even if lightly populated. It’s really striking when you see it laid out. Do you want me to do that?
