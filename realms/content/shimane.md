The Realm of Shimane is a realm in Japan.

Old provinces: Iwami, Izumo.

The prefecture has five districts.
Iishi District: Iinan.
Kanoashi District: Tsuwano, Yoshika.
Nita District: Okuizumo.
Ochi District: Kawamoto, Misato, Onan.

Generally speaking, the land of Izumo lies with its head facing east and its tail extending toward the southwest. The southern and eastern regions are in the mountains; the north and west are adjacent to the sea. Izumo is 45.6 miles from east to west, and 61 miles from north to south.

Because it is difficult to carry out surveys, there may be errors in these calculations.

In compiling this report the editor has observed the following principles: first, information should be carefully verified to the most minute detail; second, etymology should be based on the authenticity of tradition; third, as to shores and beaches, dens of birds and animals, and types of sea products, these items are too numerous to record exhaustively. However, since I cannot ignore them entirely, I will summarize and record them in this document. The report has been compiled on the basis of these principles.

Izumo was named for the august Yatsukamidzu Omidzunu's decree, yakumo tatsu, meaning "heap of clouds rising"; hence, Yakumotatsu Izumo.

In Izumo there are 399 shrines; 184 of them are registered with the Council of Religious Affairs, while 215 are unregistered.

Izumo has 9 districts; 62 townships (which include 181 villages); 4 units of single households; 6 posting-stations; and 7 units of shrine households (which include 11 villages). Each township had fifty households of roughly twenty-five persons, making the population of one township about 1,250 in eighth-century Izumo.

The district of Ou has eleven townships (thirty-three villages), one unit of single households, three posting-stations, and three units of shrine households (six villages).

The district of Shimane has eight townships (twenty-four villages), one unit of single households, and one posting-station.

The district of Akika has four townships (twelve villages), and one unit of shrine households (one village).

The district of Tatenuhi has four townships (twelve villages), one unit of single households, and one unit of shrine households (one village).

The district of Izumo has eight townships (twenty-three villages), and one unit of shrine households (two villages).

The district of Kamuto has eight townships (twenty-two villages), one unit of single households, two posting-stations, and one unit of shrine households (one village).

The district of Ihishi has seven townships (nineteen villages).

The district of Nita has four townships (twelve villages).

The district of Ohohara has eight townships (twenty-four villages).

The character sato used above to designate townships was adopted in place of the old character in accordance with the supplementary code of 715. The characters used to designate the names of these townships are the ones adopted in accordance with the oral edict of 726, transmitted by the Department of People's Affairs.

Izumo was named for the words of the God Yatsukamizu Omidzunu. Omidzunu, whose name means "God of the Great Water," performed the kunihiki, or land-pulling. The "great water" in Izumo is the Great River Hinokawa, and it is believed the God of the Great Water was an anthropomorphic representation of the action of the river, which increased the arable land of Izumo with its deposits.

The august Omidzunu spoke majestically thus: "Clouds-Rising Izumo is a narrow strip of young land. When the creator gods established the land of Izumo they made it small. Therefore, it must be enlarged with the addition of more land, which is to be attached to the original land of Izumo."

"As I looked at the cape of white Shiragi in search of spare land," he said, "I could see that Shiragi had an overabundance." Thereupon, he took a wide spade shaped like a maiden's chest, thrust it into the land as though he had plunged it into the gill of a large fish, shook it about as if brandishing pampas grass, and broke off a piece. Then he looped a three-ply rope around the land and began to pull it. He pulled the rope slowly, as if reeling in a fishing line. As it came near, it looked like a huge riverboat being pulled by his august might. "Come land, come hither," said the god. Thus, he added to Izumo the portion of land called the cape of Kizuki, the present-day site of Izumo Taisha, which protrudes from the inlet of Kozu. The mooring post to which he fastened this land is Mt. Sahime, which separates Izumo Province from Ihami Province. The rope used for the land-pulling is the long beach of Sono.

The noble god spoke again. "As I looked toward Saki, in the north, I could see that there was more land to be spared." So saying, he took the wide spade shaped like a maiden's chest, thrust it into the land as though he had plunged it into the gill of a large fish, shook it about as if brandishing pampas grass, and broke off a piece. Then he tied a three-ply rope around the land and began to pull it. He pulled the rope slowly, as if reeling in a fishing line. It looked like a huge riverboat being pulled by his august might. "Come land! Come hither!" said the god. This annexed piece of land is the land mass of Sada, which projects from the cape of Taku.

"As I looked toward the land of Nunami, in the north, in my search for spare land," he said once again, "I could see some." Thus he picked up the spade shaped like a maiden's chest, thrust it into the land as though he had plunged it into the gill of a large fish, shook it about as if brandishing pampas grass, and broke off a piece. Then he tied a three-ply rope around the land and began to pull it. He pulled the rope slowly as if reeling in a fishing line. It looked like a huge riverboat being pulled by his mighty power. "Come land! Come hither!" said the god. This piece of land is the land mass of Kurami. It extends outward from the cape of Tashimi.

Once again the God Omidzunu said mightily, "As I gaze toward the cape of Tsutsu in Koshi, in my search for spare land, I see more land to be spared." Koshi is an old name for the Hokuriku region of Echizen, Etchu, and Echigo. He grasped the wide spade shaped like a maiden's chest, thrust it into the land as though he had plunged it into the gill of a large fish, and broke off a piece. Then he tied a three-ply rope around the land and began to pull it. He pulled the rope as if he were reeling in a fishing line. It looked like a huge riverboat being pulled by his mighty power. This additional land is the cape of Miho, situated at the eastern tip of the Shimane Peninsula. The rope used to pull the land became the Isle of Yomi, the present-day island of Yumigahama, which forms the border between Shimane and Tottori prefectures. The stake to which the rope was firmly tied is Mt. Fire God (Hinokamidake) in the province of Hahaki, the present-day Mt. Daisen.

"Now I am finished pulling the land," said the god. Thereupon, the God Omidzunu set his cane in the ground of Ou and uttered a word, "O-e." That is why this place is called Ou. What is known as the sacred woods of Ou is situated on a small hill northeast of the district office. The diameter of this mound is about forty-four feet. There is a lofty tree atop the hill.

Township of Mori. Mori is situated 13.1 miles southeast of the district office. The Great God Ohonamuchi, when he walked along Mt. Nagaye on his return from his campaign to pacify Yakuchi in the land of Koshi, said, "The land that I have opened and governed shall be entrusted hereafter to the Imperial Grandson for his peaceful administration. As for the land of Izumo, it shall be kept as my territory and I will dwell in it forever. I will protect it like a precious jewel. Green hills and mountains shall surround Izumo, and I shall protect it." Therefore, the place will be called Mori, meaning "to defend." The new characters for mori were adopted in 726.

Township of Yashiro. Yashiro is located thirteen miles east of the district office. "This is the shrine in which I will reside," said the God Amatsuko, the ancestor of Iki of Yashiro, when he came down from heaven with Ame no Hohi. That is why the place is called Yashiro, meaning "shrine." The new characters for yashiro were adopted in 726.

Township of Tatenuhi. It is 10.7 miles northeast of the district office. At this place Futsunushi, the god sent from the Plain of High Heaven, stitched up a rip in his sturdy shield of heaven. Thus it was named Tatenuhi, meaning "shield fastening."

Township of Yasuki. It is 9.1 miles northeast of the district office. Lord Susanowo made a tour of inspection there. Upon his arrival at this place, Susanowo said, "My mind has been comforted." Therefore, the place is called Yasuki, meaning "being comforted."

On the north shore of this township there is a cape called Himesaki. A daughter of Imaro of the Katari no Omi (head of a reciter clan) was strolling around the cape. Suddenly she was attacked by a shark. It was the thirteenth day of the seventh month of the second year of the Emperor Tenmu, in the year 674. The daughter of Imaro did not return home but was killed by the shark.

Imaro buried his daughter in the ground along the shore of Himesaki. Deeply grieved, he cried to heaven and stamped the earth. Day and night he sobbed and staggered near the grave. Several days passed. As the story goes, Imaro brought himself under control, whetted his arrowheads, sharpened the edge of his halberd, and chose an advantageous spot from which to attack the shark. He worshiped the gods, praying, "Fifteen million heavenly gods, and fifteen million gods of the earth, 399 shrines venerated in this land, and all the deities in the sea, may your gentle spirits watch over me in peace. But I beseech you, gods, let all your brave spirits abide by my desire. If there be a divine spirit, may it help me avenge the wrongs done to my daughter. And let me know the divine nature of the spirit through my success."

Meanwhile, a hundred sharks gathered slowly and quietly, leading the shark that killed Imaro's daughter. The sharks approached Imaro, and remained there, motionless, tightly surrounding the guilty shark. Thereupon, Imaro took up his halberd and stabbed the shark. Thus, the shark was caught and executed. Then the other sharks dispersed. When the dead shark was cut open, a leg of the dead girl was found. Thereupon, the shark was torn to pieces, pierced with a stake, and exposed on the roadside. Imaro is the father of Atau of the Katari no Omi, the resident of Yasuki. It has been sixty years since this incident occurred, placing the compilation in the year 733.

Township of Yamakuni. It is 10.9 miles southeast of the district office. Futsunushi came to this place during a campaign. He said, "This is the land I wish to behold forever." Because of this the place is called Yamakuni, meaning "land to behold forever." The tax storehouses are located there.

Township of Ihinashi. It is 10.6 miles southeast of the district office. Ohokunitama, or the Great Spirit of Land, enjoyed his majestic meal at this place when he descended from heaven. Hence, the place is known as Ihinashi, meaning "to have a meal." The characters were altered to ihinashi in 726.

Township of Tone. It is 8.6 miles east of the district office. Shibi, of the Heki no Omi, a clan descended from Korean immigrants and ancestor of the Tone no Kimi, who is in charge of the tax storehouses, served at the Imperial Court as an Imperial Attendant when Emperor Kimmei ruled from the Imperial Palace of Shikishima. The township of Tone is the place where this man lived after completing his service. Therefore, it is called Tone, meaning "Imperial Attendant." Tax storehouses are situated in this township.

Township of Ohokusa (Sakusa). It is .8 mile southeast of the district office. Aohata Sakusahiko, the God of Hemp and a son of Susanowo, resided at this place. As hemp can grow as tall as six feet, the place was called Ohokusa, meaning "tall grass."

Township of Yamashiro. It is 1.1 miles northwest of the district office. Yamashiro Hiko, a son of Ohonamuchi, the Creator God of Izumo, lived at this place. The place is called Yamashiro after him. There are tax storehouses located there.

Township of Hayashi. It is 7.2 miles west of the district office. The Lord of the Great Land Ohonamuchi came upon this place during his campaign to pacify the Yakuchi of Koshi. At that time, the grove in this area was rich and verdant. The god said, "This grove rouses my spirit." The place is called Hayashi, meaning both "grove" and "to rouse the spirit." The characters were altered to hayashi in 726.

Township of Shishiji. It is 12.3 miles west of the district office. There are two statues of wild boar on a hill in the southern part of this township. It is said that these are the images of boar that were hunted by the Lord of the Great Land. One statue is 26 feet, 2 inches long; 9 feet, 6 inches high; and 55 feet, 4 inches around. The other is 24 feet, 3 inches long; 7 feet, 7 inches high; and 18 feet, 1 inch around. There is also a statue of the lord's hunting dog, 9.7 feet long, 3.8 feet high, and 18.5 feet around. As all these images are natural rock formations, the statue of the dog is indistinguishable from those of the boar. These rock statues are still in place. Hence, this spot is called Shishiji, meaning "boar's passageway."

Unit of single households. It is 2.2 miles east of the district office. In accordance with the regrouping of the household units based on the census of 727, a village was established with a group of households numbering fewer than fifty, too few to form a township. Therefore, it was named amaribe, meaning "left over" or "surplus" households. The same practice was utilized in other districts.

Posting-station of Noki. It is 6.7 miles east of the district office. Because the great god Noki resides at this place, it is called Noki.

Posting-station of Kuroda. It is located in the same place as the district office. There is a village called Kuroda .6 mile northwest of the district office where the soil is black. The place is called Kuroda, meaning "black field," because of its soil. Formerly the posting-station was situated at Kuroda. That is why it is called by this name. The posting-station is now adjacent to the district office, but it is still known by the old name.

Posting-station of Shishiji. It is 12.6 miles west of the district office. The origin of this name is the same as the origin of the name of the township of Shishiji.

Unit of shrine households of Izumo. It is .7 mile southwest of the district office. These shrine households belong to two deities: Kumano Kamuro, a beloved son of Izanagi, enshrined in the Kumano Shrine; and the Lord of the Great Land, Ohonamuchi, the god of agriculture, who created the arable land with five hundred hoes and ploughs. This is why they are called shrine households. The same practice was utilized in other districts.

Unit of shrine households of Kamo. It is 11.2 miles southeast of the district office. Ajisuki Takahiko, meaning "the Shining God of the Hoe and Plough," a son of the Lord of the Great Land, resides at the Kamo Shrine in Kadzuraki. These households belong to him. Therefore, it is called Kamo. The new characters were adopted in 726.

Unit of shrine households of Imube. It is 7.3 miles west of the district office. This is the place where the kuni no miyatsuko undergoes his purification and observes abstinence before proceeding to the Imperial Court to perform the Kamuyogoto, or the presentation of the divine words of congratulation. Hence, it is called Imube, or the place of ablution.

There is a hot spring on the river bank in this locality. The site is known for its scenic beauty. Men and women, old and young, visit this spot, arriving by land and sea. They gather here, put up a market, and enjoy themselves, mingling together; they are noisy and lively. One dip in the spring and their physical beauty is improved; two dips and all their ailments are healed. Since ancient times, the good effect of bathing here has never failed. Therefore, the people call it "the hot spring of the gods."

Kyokoji Temple. It is situated in the township of Tone, 8.4 miles east of the district office. A five-story pagoda has been erected there. Buddhist priests live in the temple. The temple was built by the priest Kyoko. This is the only temple designated by its proper name in the Izumo fudoki; all the rest are simply described as new temples.

A new temple. It is located in the township of Yamashiro, 1.5 miles northwest of the district office. A chapel has been erected there. No priests live in this temple. The temple was built by Mare of Heki no Kimi.

A new temple. It is also located in the township of Yamashiro, .7 mile northwest of the district office. A chapel has been constructed there. A Buddhist priest resides in this temple. The temple was built by Otoyama of the Izumo no Omi. Otoyama is the vice district governor of Ihishi.

A new temple. It is in the township of Yamakuni, 10.4 miles southeast of the district office. There is a three-story pagoda in the precinct of the temple. The temple was built by Newo, of the Hekibe, who is a resident of Yamakuni.

Unit of single households.
Posting-station of Chikumi.

Shimane was named after the words of the Lord of the Great Water, Omidzunu, who performed the land pulling. Because he delivered an august address at this place, it is called Shimane, meaning "island base."

Township of Asakumi. Asakumi is located 3.4 miles south of the district office. The God of Kumano, also known as Kushimikeno or "the Lord of Food," issued an order to appoint five groups of people to take charge of his divine meal. The God gave them a place to live in this township. This is why the place is called Asakumi, meaning "drawing water in the morning."

Township of Yamaguchi. It is situated 1.8 miles south of the district office. Tsurugihiko, a son of Susanowo, piously said, "This place is the entrance to my territory." Thus, it was named Yamaguchi, meaning "entrance to the hills."

Township of Tashimi. It is 3.7 miles east of the district office. The Lord of the Great Land said, "I made this land firmly." This is why the place is called Tashi, meaning "firmly made." People today mistakenly call it Tashimi, however. The tax storehouses are located in this township.

Township of Miho. Miho is located 9.1 miles east of the district office. The Lord of the Great Land married Princess Nunagaha, a daughter of Hetsukushiwi (God of the Coast) and a granddaughter of Okitsukushiwi (God in the Offing) who resided in the land of Koshi. The God Mihosusumi, a son of the two deities, is enshrined at this place. This is how the place came to be known as Miho. This township has a port at the eastern tip of the Shimane Peninsula.

Township of Kataye. It is located 6.7 miles east of the district office. Kunioshiwake, a son of Susanowo, said, "The land I govern is in good condition geographically." Therefore, it was named Kataye, meaning "well-shaped land."

Township of Kaga. It is 8.1 miles northwest of the district office. This is where the Great God Sada was born. Princess Kisakahi (the Goddess of Shellfish), a daughter of the Great Ancestor God Kami Musubi, said, "How dark is this cave!" She took up the shining bow and shot an arrow into the air. Thereupon, the cave was illuminated. Thus, the place was named Kaga, meaning "illuminated."

Township of Ikuma. It is located 5.5 miles northwest of the district office. The god Yahiro Hokonagayorihiko (Prince of the Long Halberd), a son of Kami Musubi, said, "I, the son of the Spirit of Fertility, will never be provoked and will live peacefully." Because of these words, the place was named Ikuma, meaning "unprovoked."

Township of Hohoki. It is 4.9 miles west of the district office. Umukahime, a daughter of the Spirit of Fertility, flew over this place in the guise of a bush warbler and has been enshrined there. Therefore, it is called Hohoki, meaning "warbler."

Unit of single households. The explanation for this term is the same as that for the households of the district of Ou.

Posting-station of Chikumi. It is located 5.7 miles northeast of the district office. Tsukutsumi, a descendant of Izanagi, is enshrined there. Therefore, it should be called Tsukutsumi. Today, however, people call it Chikumi.

South of the district of Shimane is the Iriumi, the present-day Shinji Lake. The following items are listed from west to east.

The ferry at the Straits of Asakumi. A roadway runs on the east side of the ferry, and a vast field is located on the west side. The ferry landing is situated in between the two. The people set numerous bamboo fish traps all over the straits. In spring and autumn, during the open season, a variety of fish, large and small, pass through the straits and gather around the traps. They press like the wind and crash like the water. Some break through the traps, others spring to the shore to be dried or caught by the birds. Because of the fish, large and small, the beach and its houses are astir with bustling people. Peddlers come from all over the land. The site becomes a temporary marketplace. Two beaches extend eastward on both the north and the south sides of the straits as far as the beach of Ohowi. On these beaches ice fishing is possible. The water is deep.

The restricted ferry port of Asakumi, intended for use by officials. The distance between the opposite shores is 440 feet. The roadway runs from the provincial government office of Izumo to the north shore of the province by way of this ferry.

Ohowi Beach. Sea slugs and edible seaweed are obtained there. Earthenware is also produced there.

Cold Spring of Ohomi. The area east, west, and north of the spring is mountainous; to the south is a vast sea. Between the mountains and the sea there is a stretch of pebbly beach. Clear spring water flows out of this beach. The scenery at the site is so beautiful that men and women, old and young, frequently gather there. Whenever they come, there are festive celebrations.

The Cape of Mahehara. Except on the south, the cape is surrounded by craggy hills. At the foot of these hills there is a reservoir, the circumference of which is 1,540 feet; its depth is 14.6 feet. There is a luxuriant growth of trees and grass on the shores. Birds such as the mandarin duck, teal, and wild goose fly over this place and live in it during the appropriate seasons. South of the reservoir is the sea. A narrow beach spreads east and west between the sea and the reservoir. Its length is 550 feet; its width is 33 feet. A row of pine trees grows on the beach. The water is deep and clear. It is such a beautiful place that people of both sexes occasionally come to enjoy it. Some go home after enjoying the gathering to the full; others become so engrossed in the outing that they forget to go home.

Tako Shima (octopus isle). It is about 6 miles in circumference, and 29 feet in height. The old folks told us the following story. There was an octopus living at the cape of Kidzuki in the district of Izumo. The sky-flying eagle caught the octopus and brought it to this isle, where it stayed. This is why the island was named Octopus Isle. Nevertheless, people today mistakenly call it Taku Shima. The soil is fertile. There are two pine trees on the west side of the isle. In addition, miscanthus, nut grass, starwort, rhubarb, and other plants grow there. There is an imperial pasture on this isle, belonging to the Ministry of Military Affairs of the central government, where animals were raised for the use of army divisions stationed in the district of Ou. The isle is 4,950 feet from the main island.

Mukade Shima (centipede island). Its circumference is 1.8 miles. Its height is 19 feet. According to the elders, the octopus who lived on Tako Shima brought a centipede to this island. Therefore, it is called Mukade Shima. On the east side of the island there is a Shinto shrine. The other buildings are the houses of the farmers. The soil is rich, trees and grasses are thick, and there is a luxuriant growth of mulberry and hemp. This is what people call Shima no Sato, "the village of the island." It is 3,850 feet from the shore of the main island. Between this island and Yomi no Shima (the island of the netherworld) in Hahaki Province there is a rock floor about 3,300 feet long and 330 feet wide. The water is shallow, so it is possible to cross on horseback. When the tide is high, it is about 2 feet, 5 inches deep; when the tide is low it is almost like land.

Watada Shima. The circumference of the island is 1.2 miles. Pasania, camellia, paulownia, pine, taro, starwort, butterbur, and Japanese silver leaf grow there. Deer and wild boar also live on this island. It is 55 feet from the main island. The depth of the water between the islands is not known.

Misa Shima. It is 1,430 feet in circumference, and 39 feet in height. Pasania, oak, miscanthus, reed, Japanese silver leaf, and starwort grow there.

Tonoye no Seki (the barrier of Tonoye). It is 6.8 miles east of the district office. It is not located on a separate island, but is located on the shore of the main island. The barrier faces the island of Yomi in Hahaki Province.

Cape Kuriye. This cape also faces the island of Yomi. The narrowest point between the island of Yomi and Cape Kuriye is 1,188 feet. West of the cape is the east end of the Iriumi.

Products obtainable in the southern part of the Iriumi include dolphin, shark, mullet, sea bass, punctatus, black porgy, ice fish, sea slug, lobster shrimp, and edible seaweed. They are too numerous to be listed exhaustively.

This is the place where the Great God Sada was born. When he was about to be delivered, the bow and arrow of his father became invisible. At this the mother, Kisakahi, a daughter of the Spirit of Fertility, said in prayer, "May the gods make the bow and arrow reappear if my child is the son of my husband, who is the God of Bravery." Thereupon, a bow and arrow of horns appeared in the water. The mother took them up, saying, "These are not my vanished bow and arrow." Then she threw them into the water. Soon a golden bow and arrow materialized in the water. The mother picked them up, saying, "What a dark cavern this is!" and shot a golden arrow through the cave wall. Straightaway a ray of sunlight streamed into the cavern.

This is the seat of the shrine of the Goddess Kisakahi. Whenever people today navigate around the cavern they shout loudly so that the echoes will pacify the spirit of the cavern. If people proceed without making noise, the spirit of the gods will invariably appear and cause a gale to capsize their boat.

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Akika

In the district of Akika there are four townships (twelve villages) and one unit of shrine households.

Township of Etomo: The old characters were etomo.
Township of Tada: The characters remained unchanged.
Township of Ohono: The characters remained unchanged.
Township of Inu: The old characters were inu.
Each of the above four townships has three villages.

Unit of shrine households.

Akika was named after the goddess Akika, whose shrine is north of the district office. This deity's name is found only in the Izumo fudoki.

Township of Etomo. It is 3.1 miles northeast of the district office. The god Ihasakahiko, a son of Susanowo, when making an inspection tour over the land, said, "The land is young and beautiful. It is shaped like a painted arm piece." He wished to build his shrine here. Thus, it was named Etomo, meaning "painted arm piece." The characters were altered to etomo in 726.

Township of Tada. It is 1.7 miles northwest of the district office. When the god Tsukihoko, whose name means "god of the penetrating halberd," a son of Susanowo, came to this place on an inspection tour, he said, "My heart has become bright and truthful. I shall dwell at this place." He decided to build his shrine there. Therefore, the place is called Tada, meaning "truthful."

Township of Ohono. It is 3.3 miles west of the district office. Waka Futsunushi (Young Lord of the Spiritual Sword) hunted here at one time. He ordered a huntsman to wait on the west hill of this township, while he chased a wild boar from the south to the north. When he reached the winding dale of this township, he lost sight of the boar. He said, "It is only natural that I lost trace of that wild boar." Thus, it was named Uchino, meaning "lost field." The people today wrongly call it Ohono.

Township of Inu. It is 4.9 miles west of the district office. Ame no Mikatsuhime, the wife of Ohosumihiko, who resided in the township of Inu, once made an inspection tour. When she came to this place, she said, "Oh, beautiful is the land of Inu!" This is how the place was named Inu. The characters were altered to become inu in 726.

Mandarin ducks, teal, wild geese, and crucian carp are found there. Reeds, Indian rice, and sedge grow on all four sides. The water lilies were abundant before the first year of Yoro (717). Since the second year they have all died for no apparent reason. Not a single root remains. They say that there are many pieces of earthenware, large jars, and tiles in the bottom of the reservoir, as the ancients believed earthenware could appease the spirits of the water. Since ancient times, several people have drowned in the reservoir. Its depth is not known.

Between the beach and the village there are no rocks or plants at all, just piles of white sand. When there is a strong wind, the sand swirls and falls like snow; some is scattered on the ground like ants, while some covers the mulberry and hemp bushes.

There are two cliff walls, which have been tunnelled through. One opening is 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet high. The other is 22 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet high. The stream that flows through these tunnels empties into the Great Sea. East of the stream is the district of Shimane; to the west is the district of Akika. It has a length of 990 feet, and a width of 15 feet, between the river mouth and the rice field to the south. The water of the rice field is the source of the stream. This is one of the sources of the above-mentioned Sada Gaha. Water from the rice field of Watari village takes two routes: one south, the other north. According to the elders, Haso, the father of the Shimane District governor, Kunimaro of the Kosebe no Omi, cut through the rocks in order to drain the water from the rice fields.

The beach, which lies between the rocks in the west and the cape of Shimo, the boundary of the district of Tatenuhi, is very craggy. It is so rough that there is no place for ships to anchor, even when the wind is quiet.

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Tatenuhi

The district of Tatenuhi has four townships (twelve villages), one unit of single households, and one unit of shrine households.

Township of Saka: The characters remained unchanged.
Township of Tatenuhi: The characters remained unchanged.
Township of Kutami: The old characters were kutami.
Township of Nuta: The old characters were nuta.
Each of the above four townships has three villages.

Unit of single households.
Unit of shrine households.

Tatenuhi was named after the words of the god Kami Musubi (Spirit of Fertility). He said, "Go and respectfully build a shrine for the Lord of the Great Land in the likeness of my present residence. My residence, the Grand Ameno Hisumi Palace, was constructed of thousands and thousands of yards of strong rope tied to the beams and pillars of the building. The ends of the rope were left hanging beautifully from the rooftree. Now, take the measurement of this palace, and build one exactly like it for him."

Thus, he appointed and dispatched Ame no Mitori, or the Noble Bird of High Heaven, to be in charge of shield craft. The mission came to Tatenuhi and initiated shield craft for the use of the shrine of the Great God. Following this tradition, the people of the district make and dedicate shields and halberds to the deities of the land. This is why the district is called Tatenuhi, meaning "shield making."

Township of Saka. It is located 1.5 miles east of the district office. A multitude of deities gathered together, built a brewery, and fermented rice wine in the river valley of Saka. They held festivals day after day before they dispersed. Therefore, it is called Saka, meaning "rice wine."

Township of Tatenuhi. The township of Tatenuhi is east of the district office. The etymology of the name of the township is the same as that of the name of the district. There is a cavern in the rock wall of Nariiso on the north beach. Inside it is 15 feet square, 70 feet high, and 70 feet wide. There is a small cave on the south side of the cavern. Its opening is 6 feet in circumference and 2 feet in diameter. Nobody knows how deep it is, because one cannot enter the cave.

Township of Kutami. It is 1.9 miles east of the district office. The Lord of the Great Land made a tour in search of a site for a warehouse in which to store the rice from Ame no Miihida (the heavenly shrine field). When he came to this place, he encountered a rain shower and was drenched. "What a hill this is! I am soaking wet," said the god. Because of this, it is called Kutami, meaning "soaking wet." The characters were altered to kutami in 726.

Township of Nuta. It is situated 2.7 miles west of the district office. The god Unodzihiko said, "I will use this delicious water to moisten my dried rice." Thus, he named the area Nita, meaning "moist." People today, however, mistakenly call it Nuta. They should properly call the place Nita. The characters were altered to nuta in 726.

Unit of single households. The explanation of this designation is the same as that found under the district of Ou.

Unit of shrine households. They belong to the Izumo Shrine. The origin of the name of the unit is the same as that found under the district of Ou.

There is one newly constructed temple in the township of Nuta. It has a chapel in its precinct. The temple is located 2.2 miles west of the district office. It was built by Izumo no Omi Ohota, the present district governor of Tatenuhi.

It is 10 feet in height, and 10 feet in circumference. Stone deities are widely believed to ensure safe and easy childbirth. On the roadside at the foot of the mountain there are also more than one hundred stone deities. According to the elders, this is the village of Taku in which Adzisuki Takahiko's consort, Ameno Mikadzihime, gave birth to Takitsuhiko.

When she was about to give birth to her son, the princess said, "I desire that you be born, my child, in a place that faces your father's residence. Kamunabi Yama is the place I have chosen." What people call "the stone gods" are the rocks in which the spirit of Takitsuhiko dwells. This god provides rainfall when the people pray for relief from drought.

Township of Takerube. It is 4.2 miles east of the district office. Formerly this township was called the village of Uya because the god Uyatsube came down from the Plain of High Heaven to the ridge of the hill in this township. His shrine is located there. The name was changed to Takerube because the emperor willed it. The emperor posthumously known as Keiko, who governed the realm from the Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, said, "The name of my son, Yamato Takeru, must never be forgotten." Thus, he established Takerube. At the same time, Komi of Kamuto no Omi was ennobled as Takerube no Omi. Ever since, Takerube no Omi and his people have lived here. That is why it is called Takerube.

Township of Shitsunu. It is located 2 miles east of the district office.

There is a ridge called Nadzuki on the beach north of this township. It is about 10 feet high. Pine trees grow at the top in such a way that it looks as though the villagers are walking to and from the cliff at dawn and dusk. The branches extend broadly, like men spreading their arms.

## District of Nita

The district of Nita has a total of four townships with twelve villages.

Nita was named for the words of the Lord of the Great Land. He said, "This land is neither too large nor too small. Trees are luxuriant on the upper reaches of the Hi no Kaha, reeds and bushes on the lower reaches. It is also suitably moist land." The ancient word for suitably moist is nitashi, the oldest use of which is found in the Izumo Fudoki.

Township of Mitokoro. This township is the seat of the district office. Ohonamuchi said, "The rice fields are good here. Hence, I would have them as my own." Therefore, it was named Mitokoro, meaning "noble territory."

Township of Misaha. It is located 8.3 miles southwest of the district office. Adzisuki Takahiko, a son of the Lord of the Great Land, was born dumb. Unable to speak, he cried day and night, even after his beard grew long. His father took him on board ship and navigated around the island to console him. But Adzisuki did not stop wailing. The Lord of the Great Land sought to learn the will of the superior gods in a dream: "Tell me why my son cries so, I pray." That night, the Lord of the Great Land saw his son speaking in his dream. Awakening immediately, he spoke to his son. And the son uttered a word, "misaha."

"What place do you call by this name, my son?" asked the Lord of the Great Land. Adzisuki left his father, crossed a river of pebbles, and walked up a slope. When he reached the upper part of the hill, he stopped, and said, "This is the place, my lord."

There was a spring at that place. Adzisuki bathed and purified his body with the spring water. This is why the kuni no miyatsuko began using the water of the spring to perform the customary ablutions before going to the Court to present the kamuyogoto. Also because of Adzisuki, a woman with child will not eat rice grown in this village. If she eats the rice, she knows her child will be born dumb. The place was named after the word misaha. There are tax granaries in this township.

Therefore, the place was named Kisuki, meaning "to overtake."

Township of Hi. It provides the seat of the district office. Hihayahiko, the God of Rapid Fire, is enshrined in this township. That is why it is called Hi.

The spirit of this deity is enshrined atop the mountain.

Suga Yama. It is 6.5 miles northeast, where cypress and Richard bald cypress grow.
