The Realm of Shimane is a realm in Japan.

Old provinces: Iwami, Izumo.

Gas" speaking, the land of Izumo lies with its head facing east
and its tail extending toward the southwest.! The southern and
eastern regions are in the mountains; the north and west are adjacent
to the sea. Izumo is 45.6 miles from east to west, and 61 miles from
north to south.’
570 feet
24.2 miles?
' Kato Yoshinari considers the eastern border of Izumo Province to be the “head”
because the sun rises from that direction. See Kato Yoshinari, Izwmo no kuni fudoki
sankyu (Tokyo: Hara Shobo, 1962), 46-47. Akimoto has a different reason. In his
view, the eastern end of Izumo Province is the point nearest the capital, hence the
“head” (NKBT 2, 94, headnote). As this translation employs historical orthography, or rekishiteki kanadzukahi, the name of this province should be expressed as
Idzumo instead of Izumo. However, because the modern spelling is so well established, I use Izumo to avoid confusion. It should be noted, however, that in the
eighth century the word was pronounced idzumo.
* The east-west distance was measured along a roadway extending from
Temaseki, on the eastern boundary of Izumo, to Takigi Yama, on the western
boundary. Distances in the Izumo fudoki are given in eighth-century measurements. These have been converted to standard English measurements, as follows: 1 shaku equals 11.67 inches, 1 bu equals .0011 miles, and 1 1 equals .332 miles.
The north-south distance was measured along a roadway extending from the
southern boundary of Hiichi Yama to the northern boundary, at the Chikumi
posting-station. Different versions of the fudoki provide different distances. Kato
agrees with Tanaka Takashi that the original text read 183 ri, 193 bu. My translation
follows Kato and Tanaka because theirs seems to be the most probable interpretation.
3570 feet and 24.2 miles: These figures are considered to be later additions to
the text (see NKBT 2, 256).

Because it is difficult to carry out surveys, there may be errors in these
calculations.‘
In compiling this report the editor [has observed the following
principles: first,] information should be carefully verified to the most
minute detail;> [second,] etymology should be based on the authenticity of tradition; [third,] as to shores and beaches, dens of birds and
animals, and types of sea products, these items are too numerous to
record exhaustively. However, since I cannot ignore them [entirely],
I will summarize and record that [in this document]. The report has
been compiled on the basis of these principles.®
Izumo was named for the august Yatsukamidzu Omidzunu’s decree,
yakumo tatsu (heap of clouds rising); hence, Yakumotatsu Izumo.’
In Izumo there are 399 shrines; 184 of them are registered with the
Council of Religious Affairs, while 215 are unregistered.’
* This is the most ambiguous sentence in the entire text. Most commentators
agree that it is a later addition, and hence avoid having to explain it. I have tried to
provide an approximate meaning.
° The graphs for the word translated as “most minute detail” literally mean “tree
leaves and branches.” Akimoto interprets the word as “descendants of the ancestral deities of Izumo.” Hisamatsu and Kato interpret it as “details.” If one were to
follow Akimoto’s suggestion, the essence of the sentence that is introduced by this
word would be rendered as “Considering [the complexity of the matters involved],
I... find it nearly impossible to exhaustively list [the achievements of] the descendants of the ancestral deities [of the land] or to determine the authenticity of the
etymological explanations.” Throughout the text, expressions in brackets add
material in English that is implicit in the Japanese. Approximate English meanings
of certain Japanese words are given in parentheses.
6 This sentence marks the end of the prefatory note to the Izumo fudoki.
’ This can be considered as one of the stories identifying the founding father of
Izumo. Omidzunu means “God/Lord of the Great Water.” The “great water” in
Izumo is the Great River Hinokawa, which had less alluvial deposit in the eighth
century than it has today. It is reasonable to suppose that the Lord of the Great
Water was an anthropomorphic representation of the action of the river, which
increased, with its deposits, the arable land of Izumo.
8 There was a basic register of shrines in the eighth century. It was called the
Jinja daicho. It is the predecessor of the Shinmei cho (also known as Jinmyo cho),
which was incorporated later into the Engi-shiki. The shrines listed in the register
were known as shikinaisha, meaning “shrines listed in the shiki.” Shrines not listed
in the register were called shikigaisha, meaning “shrines outside the shiki.”
78 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
Izumo has 9 districts; 62 sato (townships) {which include 181 kozato
(villages) }; 4 amaribe (units of single households); 6 wmaya (postingstations); and 7 kamube (units of shrine households) {which include
11 villages}.°
The district of Ou has eleven townships {which include thirtythree villages}, one unit of single households, three posting-stations,
and three units of shrine households {which include six villages}.
The district of Shimane has eight townships {which include twentyfour villages}, one unit of single households, and one posting-station.
The district of Akika has four townships {which include twelve villages},
and one unit of shrine households {which consists of one village}.
The district of Tatenuhi has four townships {which include twelve
villages}, one unit of single households, and one unit of shrine households {which consists of one village}.
The district of Izumo has eight townships {which include twentythree villages}, and one unit of shrine households {which includes
two villages}.
The district of Kamuto has eight townships {which include twentytwo villages}, one unit of single households, two posting-stations, and
one unit of shrine households {which consists of one village}.
” Each township had fifty households. An average household consisted of twentyfive persons, including persons not related to the household head by blood (according to Yanaga Teizo, Nara jidai no kizoku to nomin [Tokyo: Shibundo, 1956],
188). If this information is dependable, the population of one township was about
1,250 in eighth-century Izumo. As to the number of kozato, most texts say 179.
Drawing upon other pertinent information, Akimoto suggests that the number
was 181 (NKBT 2, 94). The sato (township) was an artificial unit created for
administrative purposes. In the Taiho Code, fifty households were grouped together regardless of the natural conformation of a village. Therefore, groupings
having fewer than fifty households were not large enough to form a sato. These
households were called amaribe, meaning “surplus” households. Posting-stations:
These stations were supposedly established about every ten miles on public roadways. Shrine households: Taxes from kamube households were allocated to the
upkeep of shrines. In other words, anyone holding a priestly position at a shrine had
control over a unit of shrine households. Although the evidence is not conclusive,
it would seem that one shrine-household unit had fewer than fifty households. For
“posting-stations,” see Sakamoto Taro, Jodai ekisei no kenkyu (Tokyo: Shibundo,
1928), 82-83.

The district of Ihishi has seven townships {which include nineteen
villages}.
The district of Nita has four townships {which include twelve

The graph sato used above [to designate townships] was adopted
in place of the [old] graph sato in accordance with the shiki (supplementary code) of 715.!° The graphs used to designate the names of these
townships are the ones that were adopted in accordance with the kuzen

Izumo was named for the words of the God Yatsukamizu Omidzunu.
The august Omidzunu, who performed the kunihiki (also kunubiki,
meaning “land-pulling”), spoke majestically [thus], “Clouds-Rising
Izumo is a narrow strip of young land. [When the creator gods established the land of Izumo] they made it small. Therefore, it must be
enlarged with the addition of more land, which is to be attached [to
the original land of Izumo].”
“As I looked at the cape of white Shiragi in search of spare land,”
he said, “I could see that Shiragi had an overabundance.” Thereupon,
he took a wide spade shaped like a maiden’s chest,” thrust it into the
land as though he had plunged it into the gill of a large fish, shook it
about as if brandishing pampas grass’ [and broke off a piece]. Then
he looped a three-ply rope around the land and began to pull it. He
pulled the rope slowly, as if reeling in [a fishing line]. As it came near,
it looked like a huge riverboat [being] pulled by his august might.
“Come land, come hither,” said the god. Thus, he added [to Izumo]
the portion of land called the cape of Kizuki, which protrudes from the
inlet of Kozu.'* The mooring post to which he fastened this land is Mt.
' The expression used here is Otome no munasuki (flat, wide plow), like the
chest of a young girl.
3 The text reads hata susuki hofuri wake. Hata susuki means “ears of Miscanthus
sinensis.” The phrase is a pillow word for ho- in hofuri- (to slay). There is a play on
the sound ho in the words ho (ears of miscanthus, or pampas grass) and hofuri
(slaying). Such play on a sound serves to stretch the meaning of a given phrase. In
the case of hatasusuki hofuri wake, the meaning becomes “brandishing ears of the
miscanthus” [he] “slew/severed.” There are numerous instances of such word play
in the Izumo fudoki.
" Kizuki is the present-day site of Izumo Taisha. The language of this section
retains some of the oldest forms of Japanese with abundant plays on words and

Sahime. This mountain separates Izumo Province from Ihami Province.
The rope used for the land-pulling is the long beach of Sono.
The [noble] god spoke again, “As I looked toward Saki, in the
north, I could see that there was more land to be spared.” So saying,
he took the wide spade shaped like a maiden’s chest, thrust it into the
land as though he had plunged it into the gill of a large fish, shook it
about as if brandishing pampas grass, and broke off a piece. Then he
tied a three-ply rope around the land, and began to pull it. He pulled
the rope slowly, as if reeling in [a fishing line]. It looked like a huge
riverboat [being] pulled by his august might. “Come land! Come
hither!” said the god. This annexed piece of land is the land mass of
Sada, which projects from the cape of Taku.
“As I looked toward the land of Nunami, in the north, in my search
for spare land,” he said [once again], “I could see some.” Thus he
picked up the spade shaped like a maiden’s chest, thrust it into the
land, as though he had plunged it into the gill of a large fish, shook it
about as if brandishing pampas grass, and broke off a piece. Then he
tied a three-ply rope around the land, and began to pull it. He pulled
the rope slowly as if reeling in [a fishing line]. It looked like a huge
riverboat [being] pulled by his mighty power. “Come land! Come
hither!” said the god. This piece of land is the land mass of Kurami. It
extends outward from the cape of Tashimi.
Once again [the God Omidzunu] said mightily, “As I gaze toward
the cape of Tsutsu in Koshi, in my search for spare land, I see more
land to be spared.”!° He grasped the wide spade shaped like a maiden’s
chest, thrust it into the land as though he had plunged it into the gill
of a large fish, and broke off a piece. Then he tied a three-ply rope
around the land and began to pull it. He pulled the rope as if [he
were] reeling in [a fishing line]. It looked like a huge riverboat [being]
pulled by his mighty power. This additional land is the cape of Miho.
The rope used to pull the land became the Isle of Yomi. The stake to
onomatopoeic expressions that are capable of modifying verbs. Note in the following
passages the repetitious descriptions of the actions of the god. The diction is typical
of storytelling, and is similar to that found in the texts of norito (Shinto prayers).
'5 The location of Nunami has not been determined.
16 Koshi is an old name for the Hokuriku region of Echizen, Etchu, and Echigo.
82 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
which the rope was firmly tied is Mt. Fire God in the province of
Hahaki.!’
“Now I am finished pulling the land,” said the god. Thereupon,
the God Omidzunu set his cane in the ground of Ou, and uttered a
word, “O-e.”'8 That is why [this place] is called Ou. {What is known
as the sacred woods of Ou is situated on a small hill northeast of the
district office. The diameter of this mound is about forty-four feet.
There is a lofty tree atop the hill.}
Township of Mori. Mori is situated 13.1 miles southeast of the district
office. The Great God Ohonamuchi, when he walked along Mt.
Nagaye on his return from his campaign to pacify Yakuchi in the land
of Koshi, said, “The land that I have opened and governed shall be
entrusted hereafter to the Imperial Grandson for his peaceful administration. As for the land of Izumo, it shall be kept as my territory and
I will dwell in it forever. I will protect it like a precious jewel. Green
hills and mountains shall surround Izumo, and I shall protect it.’
Therefore, the place will be called Mori, meaning “to defend.” {The
[new] graphs for mori were adopted in 726.}
Township of Yashiro. Yashiro is located thirteen miles east of the district
office. “This is the shrine in which I will reside,” said the God Amatsuko,
the ancestor of Iki of Yashiro, when he came down from heaven with
Ame no Hohi.” That is why the place is called Yashiro, meaning
“shrine.” {The [new] graphs for yashiro were adopted in 726.}”!
'’ Miho no Saki is situated at the eastern tip of the Shimane Peninsula. Yomi no
Shima is the present-day island of Yumigahama, which forms the border between
Shimane and Tottori prefectures. Mt. Fire God is the present-day Mt. Daisen, a
volcano (Hinokamidake in Japanese).
'’ The equation of o-e with Ou now seems artificial and unlikely. But it is the
way the people of ancient Izumo wished to relate themselves to this god.
" This legend seems vital in authenticating the story of the kuni yuzuri (surrender
of the land) to the Yamato Court. See Yamada Yoshio, Izumo no kuni no miyatsuko
kamuyogoto gikai (Shimane: Izumo Taishakyo Kyomu Honcho, 1960), 177-98.
© Amatsuko: Mention of this deity occurs only in this section of the Izumo
fudoki. He does not feature in either the Kojiki or the Nihon shoki.
*! Although there is another Yashiro Shrine in the list below, there is no evidence that this story is a later addition.
The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki 83
Township of Tatenuhi. It is 10.7 miles northeast of the district office. At
this place Futsunushi stitched up a rip in his sturdy shield of heaven.
Thus it was named Tatenuhi, meaning “shield fastening.”
Township of Yasuki. It is 9.1 miles northeast of the district office. Lord
Susanowo made a tour of inspection [there]. Upon his arrival at this
place, Susanowo said, “My mind has been comforted.” Therefore, the
place is called Yasuki, meaning “being comforted.”?? On the north
shore of this township there is a cape called Himesaki. A daughter of
Imaro of the Katari no Omi [head of a reciter clan] was strolling
around the cape.** Suddenly she was attacked by a shark. It was the
thirteenth day of the seventh month of the second year of the Emperor
Tenmu [674].” The daughter of Imaro did not return home but was
killed by the shark.
2 Futsunushi: According to the Kojiki—Nihon shoki tradition, Futsunushi was
sent from the Plain of High Heaven to negotiate with Ohokuni the peaceful
surrender of land prior to the august descent of the Imperial Grandson. In the
Kojiki he is called Futsu no Mitama (Spirit of Sword). The Nihon shoki tells us that
Futsunushi was with Take Mikazuchi (Thunder God) when he proceeded to the
northeastern part of Japan to pacify the unruly elements there. He is the entity
enshrined in the Kashima Shrine in present-day Ibaraki Prefecture. See HIT,
“District of Shida.”
3 Kamu Susanowo (Lord Susanowo): “Lord” is the English translation of the
word kami (or kamu). In the Izumo fudoki Susanowo appears with the epithet kamu
or kami, which in this case means “god.” In the Nihon shoki he appears frequently,
described by the adjectives haya and takehaya. Both words have the connotation
of wildness.
4 Katari no Omi is Imaro’s title. Among the members of the kataribe (reciters),
there are several title holders: Katari no Miyatsuko, Katari no Omi, Katari no
Muraji, Katari no Sukune, Katari no Obito, Katari no Atahi, and Katari no Kimi.
The Shinsen shojiroku also carries the title Ame no Katari no Muraji. See Kato,
Izumo no kuni fudoki sankyu, 101-2.
25 Asuka no Kiyomihara no Miya ni Amenoshita Shiroshimeshishi Sumeramikoto: His posthumous name is Tenmu Tenno. His other designations are Kiyomihara
no Miya ni Amenoshita Shiroshimeshishi Sumeramiko (in the Nihon shoki),
Kiyomihara no Sumeramikoko (Nihon shoki), and Asuka Kiyomihara no Sumeramikoto (Man’yoshu). The title used in the Izumo fudoki is the same one used in
the Todaiji archives (see Takeuchi Rizo, Yamada Hideo, and Hirano Kunio, Nihon
kodai jinmei jiten [Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kabunkan, 1963], 4:1159). This strongly
supports the theory that the Izumo fudoki is a product of the Nara period.
84 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
Imaro buried his daughter in the ground along the shore of Himesaki.“° Deeply grieved, he cried to heaven and stamped the earth.
Day and night he sobbed and staggered near the grave. Several days
passed. [As the story goes,] Imaro brought himself under control,
whetted his arrowheads, sharpened the edge of his halberd, and chose
an advantageous spot from which to attack the shark. He worshiped
the gods, praying, “Fifteen million heavenly gods, and 15 million gods
of the earth, 399 shrines venerated in this land, and all the deities in
the sea, may your gentle spirits watch over me in peace.”’ But I beseech
you, gods, let all your brave spirits abide by my desire. If there be a
divine spirit, may it help me avenge the wrongs done to my daughter.
And let me know the divine nature of the spirit [through my success].”
Meanwhile, a hundred sharks gathered slowly and quietly, leading
the shark [that killed Imaro’s daughter]. The sharks approached Imaro,
and remained there, motionless, tightly surrounding the guilty shark.
Thereupon, Imaro took up his halberd and stabbed the shark. Thus,
the shark was caught and executed. Then the other sharks dispersed.
When the dead shark was cut open, a leg of the dead girl was
found. Thereupon, the shark was torn to pieces, pierced with a stake,
and exposed on the roadside. {Imaro is the father of Atau of the
Katari no Omi, the resident of Yasuki. It has been sixty years since
this incident [occurred].}?°
Township of Yamakuni. It is 10.9 miles southeast of the district office.
Futsunushi came to this place during a campaign. He said, “This is
the land I wish to behold forever.” Because of this the place is called
Yamakuni, meaning “land to behold forever.” The tax storehouses are
located there.”
*° From this description it may be concluded that the people of that era did not
use common burial grounds.
*? Heavenly gods: The word in Japanese is amatsukami, which is customarily
translated as “gods in the Plain of High Heaven.” The Izumo people became
acquainted with the heavenly gods later in their history, while the earthly gods are
associated with the origins of the Izumo people themselves.
’’ The incident allegedly took place in 674. As the ensuing sixty years include
the year in which the incident occurred, it is actually a fifty-nine-year time span. Fiftynine years following 674 is 733, the year in which the Izumo fudoki was compiled.
*? Tax storehouses: Shoso in Japanese. The reading for the characters varies
The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki 85
Township of Ihinashi. It is 10.6 miles southeast of the district office.
Ohokunitama, or the Great Spirit of Land, enjoyed his majestic meal
at this place when he descended from heaven. Hence, the place is
known as Ihinashi, meaning “to have a meal.”*° {The graphs were
altered to thinashi in 726.}
Township of Tone. It is 8.6 miles east of the district office. Shibi, of the
Heki no Omi, the ancestor of the Tone no Kimi, who is in charge of the
tax storehouses, served at the Imperial Court as an Imperial Attendant
when Emperor Kimmei ruled from the Imperial Palace of Shikishima.*!
The township of Tone is the place where this man lived after [completing] his service. Therefore, it is called Tone, meaning “Imperial
Attendant.” Tax storehouses are situated in this township.
Township of Ohokusa {Sakusa}. It is .8 mile southeast of the district
office. Aohata Sakusahiko, the son of Susanowo, resided at this place.
Therefore, it is called Ohokusa {Sakusa}.*
Township of Yamashiro. It is 1.1 miles northwest of the district office.
Yamashiro Hiko, a son of Ohonamuchi, the Creator God of Izumo,
lived at this place.* The place is called Yamashiro after him. There
are tax storehouses located there.
depending upon the scholar. Akimoto reads it as miyake, whereas Kato reads it as
mikura. In both cases it refers to the storehouses in which the collected regular
taxes were kept. The inside of the shoso was called shoso-in. A section of the Shoku
Nihongi records the word shoso-in in this sense. See “Shoku Nihongi,” in Shintei zoho
kokushi taikei, ed. Kuroita Katsumi (Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kobunkan, 1935), 2:357.
Supervision of these storehouses was the sole responsibility of the district governors.
30 Ohokunitama: In some cases, Ohokunitama is another name for
Ohokuninushi, the Lord of the Great Land. Here, however, he is modified by the
epithet amori mashishi, which means “the one who came down from the Plain of
High Heaven.” Therefore, this deity should not be identified with Ohokuninushi,
who is a god of the earth.
31 Heki: According to the Shinsen shojiroku, the Heki clan is descended from
Korean immigrants (see also Kato, Izumo no kuni fudoki sankyu, 113).
32 Aohata Sakusahiko: God of Hemp. As hemp can grow as tall as six feet, the
place was called ohokusa, meaning “tall grass.” “Sakusa” is Kato’s reading for these
ideographs. Akimoto reads them as “Ohokusa.”
33 The name of this deity is found only in the Izumo fudoki. He is probably the
tutelary god of Yamashiro Township.
86 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
Township of Hayashi. It is 7.2 miles west of the district office. The Lord
of the Great Land Ohonamuchi came upon this place during his campaign to pacify the Yakuchi of Koshi.** At that time, the grove in this
area was rich and verdant. The god said, “This grove rouses my spirit.”
The place is called Hayashi, meaning “grove” and “to rouse the spirit,”
because of this.*° {The graphs were altered to hayashi in 726.}
Township of Shishiji. It is 12.3 miles west of the district office. There
are two statues of wild boar on a hill in the southern part of this
township. [It is said that] these are the images of boar that were
hunted by the Lord of the Great Land. {One statue is 26 feet, 2
inches, long; 9 feet, 6 inches, high; and 55 feet, 4 inches, around. The
other is 24 feet, 3 inches, long; 7 feet, 7 inches, high; and, 18 feet, 1
inch, around.} [There is also] a statue of the lord’s hunting dog. {It is
9.7 feet long, 3.8 feet high, and 18.5 feet around.} As [all these images
are] natural rock formations, the statue of the dog is indistinguishable
from those of the boar. These [rock] statues are still [in place]. Hence,
this spot is called Shishiji, meaning “boar’s passageway.”*°
Unit of single households. It is 2.2 miles east of the district office. {In
accordance with the regrouping of the household units [based on the
census of 727] a village was established [with a group of households
numbering fewer than fifty, too few to form a township]. Therefore, it
was named amaribe, meaning “left over” or “surplus” households. The
same practice was utilized in other districts. }
Posting-station of Noki. It is 6.7 miles east of the district office. Because
the great god Noki resides at this place, it is called Noki.*”
4 Koshi no Yakuchi: The last word, yakuchi, means “eight mouths,” perhaps a
euphemism for the unruly recalcitrants. It is known that there was once a place
called Yatsukuchi (eight mouths/many mouths) in the old Echigo Province (presentday Niigata Prefecture).
* The graphs introduced as the new name of the township in 726 have been
traditionally interpreted as meaning “to rouse the spirit,” while the old graph for
hayashi means “woods.” This is another example of a play on words.
*© There are some rocks on the site that might have been thought of as statues
of these animals, but they no longer resemble either a dog or a boar.
7 In the Engi-shiki this posting-station is listed as Nogi no Umaya. In the
Wamyosho it is not listed at all. Instead, a township called Nogi appears in the
The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki 87
Posting-station of Kuroda. It is located in the same place as the district
office. There is a village called Kuroda .6 mile northwest of the district
office where the soil is black. The place is called Kuroda (meaning
“black field”) because of its soil.** Formerly the posting-station was
situated at Kuroda. That is why it is called by this name. The postingstation is now adjacent to the district office, but it is still known by
the old name.
Posting-station of Shishiji. It is 12.6 miles west of the district office.
{The origin of this name is the same as the origin of the name of the
township of Shishiji.}
Unit of shrine households of Izumo. It is .7 mile southwest of the district
office. These shrine households belong to two deities: Kumano Kamuro,
a beloved son of Izanagi; and the Lord of the Great Land, Ohonamuchi,
who created the arable land with five hundred hoes and ploughs.
This is why they are called shrine households.” {The same practice
was utilized in other districts. }
Unit of shrine households of Kamo. It is 11.2 miles southeast of the
district office. Ajisuki Takahiko, a son of the Lord of the Great Land,
resides at the Kamo Shrine in Kadzuraki. These households belong to
him.* Therefore, it is called Kamo.*! {The new graphs kamo were
adopted in 726.}
Wamyosho. Therefore, it is assumed that the abolition of the posting-station of
Noki and the establishment of the township of Nogi (formerly called Noki) occurred
before the compilation of the Wamyosho, that is, in the late Heian period.
8 The soil of this place is darker than that of other areas, even today (Kato,
Izumo no kuni fudoki sankyu, 122).
3? Kumano Kamuro is the deity enshrined in the Kumano Shrine. The Lord of
the Great Land (Ohonamuchi) is the god who opened the territory by tilling the
land. Here Ohonamuchi (Ohokuninushi) is described as the god of agriculture.
Analysis of the relationship between these two deities would lead to an interesting
discussion (Kumano Kamuro, a beloved son of Izanagi, versus Ohonamuchi, the
god of the earth of Izumo).
40Ajisuki Takahiko appears as a son of Ohonamuchi in the Izumo fudoki. The
approximate meaning of his name is “the Shining God of the Hoe and Plough.”
41 The graph given here means “duck,” though the more recent two graphs
have no such connotation (see glossary, under Kamo).
88 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
Unit of shrine households of Imube. It is 7.3 miles west of the district office.
This is the place where the kuni no miyatsuko undergoes his purification
[and observes abstinence] before proceeding to the Imperial Court to
perform the Kamuyogoto, or the presentation of the divine words of
congratulation.” Hence, it is called Imube, or the place of ablution.
There is a hot spring on the river bank in this locality. The site is
known for its scenic beauty. Men and women, old and young, visit
this spot, arriving by land and sea. They gather here, put up a market,
and enjoy themselves, mingling together; they are noisy and lively.
One dip in the spring and their physical beauty is improved; two dips
and all their ailments are healed. Since ancient times, the good effect
of bathing here has never failed. Therefore, the people call it “the hot
spring of the gods.”
Kyokoji Temple. It is situated in the township of Tone, 8.4 miles east of
the district office. A five-story pagoda has been erected there. {Buddhist priests live in the temple.} The temple was built by the priest
Kyoko. {He is the grandfather of Oshiwi of the Uehara no Obito
clan, who is an [unofficial] village chief with the rank of the Greater
Initial Rank, Lower Grade.}*
A new temple. It is located in the township of Yamashiro. It is 1.5 miles
northwest of the district office. A chapel has been erected there. {No
priests live in this temple.} The temple was built by Mare of Heki no
Kimi. {He is the forebear of Imaro, of the Heki no Kimi, who is a
resident of Izumo Kamube. }**
” The term kamuyogoto may be rendered as “congratulatory words of a god or
gods.” This particular kamuyogoto is included in the norito (Shinto prayers). Every
time a new kuni no miyatsuko of Izumo was appointed, he would go to the Imperial
Court to present the emperor with these “godly words of congratulation.” Misaha
is another place where the kuni no miyatsuko of Izumo observed ablution (see
“Township of Misaha” under the “District of Nita” below).
‘> Daisoi no shimotsu shina: His rank is preceded by the word tone (or san’i),
which means “rank without office” (see glossary, under tone). Kyokoji: This is the
only temple designated by its proper name in the Izumo fudoki. All the rest are
simply described as new temples.
 Heki: Akimoto reads this name as hioki, while Hisamatsu and Kato read it as
heki. My translation follows the latter.
The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki 89
A new temple. It is [also] located in the township of Yamashiro, .7 mile
northwest of the district office. A chapel has been constructed there.
{A Buddhist priest resides in this temple.} The temple was built by
Otoyama of the Izumo no Omi. Otoyama is the vice district governor
of [hishi.*°
A new temple. It is in the township of Yamakuni, 10.4 miles southeast
of the district office. There is a three-story pagoda in the precinct of
the temple. The temple was built by Newo, of the Hekibe, who is a
resident of Yamakuni.

» This is ge shosoi in the original. Ge stands for gei (ranks given to local officials).
** The Hosokawa version and other texts list the township of Yamaguchi first
and the township of Asakumi second. In any case, the order of the listing differs
from the arrangement of the descriptions in my text, below.
The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki 95
Unit of single households.
Posting-station of Chikumi.
Shimane was named after the words of the Lord of the Great Water,
Omidzunu, who performed the land pulling. Because he delivered an
august address at this place, it is called Shimane, meaning “island
base.”
Township of Asakumi. Asakumi is located 3.4 miles south of the district
office. The God of Kumano issued an order to appoint five groups of
people to take charge of his divine meal. The God gave them a place
to live in this township. This is why the place is called Asakumi,
meaning “drawing [water] in the morning.”
Township of Yamaguchi. It is situated 1.8 miles south of the district
office. Tsurugihiko, a son of Susanowo, piously said, “This place is the
entrance to my territory.” Thus, it was named Yamaguchi, meaning
“entrance to the hills.”
Township of Tashimi. It is 3.7 miles east of the district office. The Lord
of the Great Land said, “I made this land firmly.” This is why the place
is called Tashi, meaning “firmly made.” People today mistakenly call
it Tashimi, however. The tax storehouses are located in this township.
Township of Miho. Miho is located 9.1 miles east of the district office.
The Lord of the Great Land married Princess Nunagaha, a daughter
of Hetsukushiwi (God of the Coast) and a granddaughter of
Okitsukushiwi (God in the Offing) who resided in the land of Koshi.
The God Mihosusumi, a son of the two deities, is enshrined at this
place. This is how the place came to be known as Miho.”
Township of Kataye. It is located 6.7 miles east of the district office.
Kunioshiwake, a son of Susanowo, said, “The land I govern is in good
55 In the Izumo no kuni no miyatsuko kamuyogoto, this Great God of Kumano, or
Kumano no Ohokami, is called Kushimikeno, which means “the Lord of Food.”
See Yamada, Izumo no kuni no miyatsuko, 9.
56 This deity’s name occurs only in the Izumo fudoki.
57 This township has a port at the eastern tip of the Shimane Peninsula. The port
witnessed the departure of Emperor Gotoba (in 1221) and Emperor Godaigo (in
1332) when they were exiled to the Oki Islands.
96 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
condition geographically.” Therefore, it was named Kataye, meaning
“well-shaped land.”
Township of Kaga. It is 8.1 miles northwest of the district office. This is
where the Great God Sada was born. Princess Kisakahi (the Goddess
of Shellfish), a daughter of the Great Ancestor God Kami Musubi,
said, “How dark is this cave!” She took up the shining bow and shot
an arrow into the air. Thereupon, the cave was illuminated. Thus,
the place was named Kaga, meaning “illuminated.”
Township of Ikumaa. It is located 5.5 miles northwest of the district office.
The god Yahiro Hokonagayorihiko (Prince of the Long Halberd), a
son of Kami Musubi, said, “I, the son of the Spirit of Fertility, will
never be provoked and will live peacefully.” Because of these words,
the place was named Ikuma, meaning “unprovoked.”
Township of Hohoki. It is 4.9 miles west of the district office. Umukahime, a daughter of the Spirit of Fertility, flew over this place in the
guise of a bush warbler and has been enshrined there. Therefore, it is
called Hohoki, meaning “warbler.”
Unit of single households. {{The explanation for this term is] the same
as that for the households of the district of Ou.}
Posting-station of Chikumi. It is located 5.7 miles northeast of the district office. Tsukutsumi, a descendant of Izanagi, is enshrined there.
Therefore, it should be called Tsukutsumi. Today, however, people
call it Chikumi.

67 Although I have translated this phrase as “in summer,” the original graphs
indicate that it was only for a period of about two weeks that such vegetables could
be obtained. Apparently the residents of Izumo did not know the names of these
vegetables. They may have been some variety of herb. The reading of the name of
this reservoir follows Akimoto.

South fof the district of Shimane] is the Iriumi.® {[The following
items are listed in order] from west to east. }
The ferry at the Straits of Asakumi. A roadway runs on the east side of
the ferry, and a vast field is located on the west side. The ferry landing
is situated in between the two. The people set numerous bamboo fish
traps all over the straits. In spring and autumn, during the open season,
a variety of fish, large and small, pass through the straits and gather
around the traps. They press like the wind and crash like the water.
Some break through the traps, others spring to the shore to be dried
or caught by the birds.
Because of the fish, large and small, the beach and its houses are
astir with bustling people. Peddlers come from all over the land. The
site becomes a temporary marketplace. {Two beaches extend eastward on both the north and the south sides of the straits as far as the
beach of Ohowi. On these beaches ice fishing is possible. The water is
deep. }
The [restricted] ferry port of Asakumi. The distance between the opposite shores is 440 feet. The roadway runs from the provincial government office [of Izumo] to the north shore [of the province by way of
this ferry].’°
Ohowi Beach. Sea slugs and edible seaweed are obtained there. Earthenware is also produced there.”!
Cold Spring of Ohomi. The area east, west, and north of the spring is
mountainous; to the south is a vast sea. Between the mountains and
the sea there is a stretch of pebbly beach. Clear spring water flows out
[of this beach. The scenery at the site is so beautiful that] men and
women, old and young, frequently gather there. Whenever they come,
there are festive celebrations.
The Cape of Mahehara. Except on the south, the cape is surrounded
by craggy hills. At the foot of these hills there is a reservoir, the

luxuriant growth of trees and grass on the shores. Birds such as the
mandarin duck, teal, and wild goose fly over this place and live in it
during the appropriate seasons. South of the reservoir is the sea.”A
narrow beach spreads east and west between the sea and the reservoir.
Its length is 550 feet; its width is 33 feet. A row of pine trees grows on
the beach. The water is deep and clear. It is such a beautiful place
that people of both sexes occasionally come to enjoy it. Some go home
after enjoying the gathering to the full; others become so engrossed in
the outing that they forget to go home.”
Tako Shima (octopus isle). It is about 6 miles in circumference, and 29
feet in height. The old folks told us the [following] story. There was
an octopus living at the cape of Kidzuki in the district of Izumo.”* The
“sky-flying” eagle caught the octopus and brought it to this isle, where
it stayed. This is why the island was named Octopus Isle. Nevertheless,
people today mistakenly call it Taku Shima [instead of Tako Shima].
The soil is fertile. There are two pine trees on the west side of the isle.
In addition, miscanthus, nut grass, starwort, rhubarb, and other [plants]
grow there. {There is an imperial pasture on this isle.}” The isle is
4,950 feet from the main island.
Mukade Shima (centipede island). Its circumference is 1.8 miles. Its
height is 19 feet. According to the elders, the octopus who lived on
Tako Shima brought a centipede to this island. Therefore, it is called
the Mukade Shima (centipede island). On the east side of the island
there is a Shinto shrine. The other buildings are the houses of the
farmers. The soil is rich, trees and grasses are thick, and there is a
luxuriant growth of mulberry and hemp. This is what people call “Shima
no Sato (the village of the island).” {It is 3,850 feet from the shore of

central government. The animals were raised for the use of army divisions, or

the [main island].} Between this island and Yomi no Shima (the island
of Yomi [the netherworld]) in Hahaki Province there is a rock floor. It
is about 3,300 feet long and 330 feet wide. [The water] is shallow, so
it is possible to cross on horseback. When the tide is high, it is about
2 feet, 5 inches, deep; when the tide is low it is [almost] like land.
Watada Shima. The circumference of the island is 1.2 miles. {Pasania,
camellia, paulownia, pine, taro, starwort, butterbur, and Japanese silver
leaf grow there. Deer and wild boar also live on this island.} It is 55

Tonoye no Seki [the barrier of Tonoye]. It is 6.8 miles east of the district
office. {It is not [located on a separate] island, but is located on the
shore of the main island. The barrier faces the island of Yomi in Hahaki
Province. }”°
Cape Kuriye. {This cape also faces the island of Yomi. The narrowest
point between the island of Yomi and Cape Kuriye is 1,188 feet.} West
of the cape is the east end of the Iriumi.
Products obtainable in the southern part of the Iriumi include
dolphin, shark, mullet, sea bass, punctatus, black porgy, ice fish, sea
slug, lobster shrimp, and edible seaweed. They are too numerous to be
listed exhaustively.
North of the district of Shimane is the Great Sea. The eastern side

{This is the place where the Great God Sada was born. When he
was about to be delivered, the bow and arrow of his father became invisible. At this the mother, Kisakahi, a daughter of the Spirit of Fertility,
said, in prayer, “May the gods make the bow and arrow reappear if my
child is the son of my husband, who is the God of Bravery.”
Thereupon, a bow and arrow of horns appeared in the water. The
mother took them up, saying, “These are not [my vanished] bow and
arrow.” Then she threw them into the water. [Soon] a golden bow
and arrow materialized in the water. The mother picked them up,
saying, “What a dark cavern this is!” and shot a golden arrow through
the cave wall. [Straightaway a ray of sunlight streamed into the cavern. ]
This is the seat of the shrine of the Goddess Kisakahi. Whenever
people today navigate around the cavern they shout loudly [so that
the echoes will pacify the spirit of the cavern]. If people proceed without making noise, [the spirit of] the gods will invariably appear and
cause a gale to capsize their boat.}

8! Most texts contain alternative graphs in small letters following the word umugi,
which is translated here as “clam.” Kato interprets these alternative graphs as
meaning “sea chestnuts.” My translation adopts Kato’s interpretation (within the
braces). For the graphs, see the glossary, under umugi.

it is assumed to have been located somewhere north of the present-day city of
Matsuye.

below.

District of Akika
In the district of Akika there are four townships {twelve villages}
and one unit of shrine households.**
Township of Etomo: The old graphs were etomo.
Township of Tada: The graphs remained unchanged.
Township of Ohono: The graphs remained unchanged.
Township of Inu: The old graphs were inu.
{Each of the above four townships has three villages. }
Unit of shrine households.
Akika was named after the goddess Akika, whose shrine is north of
the district office.®?
Township of Etomo. It is 3.1 miles northeast of the district office. The
86 According to the SSR, Kosobe no Asomi is the descendant of Kogen Tenno.
However, the title omi is not found under the name Kosobe. See Saeki Arikiyo,
Shinsen shojiroku no kenkyu (Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kobunkan, 1962), 256.
87 The SSR lists Tajihibe as one of the shinbetsu, or persons descended from local
deities (ibid.).
88 The district of Akika comprised the area north of the present-day Shinji
Lake. Its eastern border was the Sada River and its western limit the present-day
city of Hirata.
8° This deity’s name is found only in the Izumo fudoki. Probably she is an indigenous goddess.
110 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
god Ihasakahiko, a son of Susanowo, when making an inspection tour
over the land, said, “The land is young and beautiful. It is shaped like
a painted arm piece.” I would like to build my shrine here.” Thus, it
was named Etomo, meaning “painted arm piece.” {The graphs were
altered to etomo in 726.}
Township of Tada. It is 1.7 miles northwest of the district office. When
the god Tsukihoko,*! a son of Susanowo, came to this place on an
inspection tour, he said, “My heart has become bright and truthful. I
shall dwell at this place.” He decided to build his shrine there. Therefore, the place is called Tada, meaning “truthful.”
Township of Ohono. It is 3.3 miles west of the district office. Waka
Futsunushi (Young Lord of the Spiritual Sword) hunted here at one
time.®? He ordered a huntsman to wait on the west hill of this township, while he chased a wild boar from the south to the north. When
he reached the winding dale of [this township], he lost sight of the
boar. He said, “It is only natural that I lost trace of that wild boar.”
Thus, it was named Uchino, meaning “lost field.” The people today
wrongly call it “Ohono.”
Township of Inu. It is 4.9 miles west of the district office. Ame no
* Kato suggests that etomo is derived from the words e (picture) and tomo
(archery arm piece). He also says that the shape of tomo is like that of magatama
(comma-shaped jewel). I have followed Kato’s interpretation. Etomo faces Etomo
Bay, which is on the Japan Sea.
»! This god’s full name is Tsukihoko Towoyoruhiko. The first word can mean
“halberd,” and the second, “penetrating.” Altogether, the name means “god of the
penetrating halberd.” His name is found only in the Izumo fudoki. He probably
represents the indigenous people of the area who long resisted the subjugation
efforts of the Yamato.
” Tsukihoko’s words, “my heart has become bright and truthful,” are reminiscent of an expression used in emperors Monmu and Shomu’s edicts (“Shoku
Nihongi,” 1, 99).
3 Tt is said that this Futsunushi is the same deity who mended his shield in the
township of Tatenuhi in the district of Ou.
*4 Kato gives the name of the dale as Auchi, as my earlier translation has it.
However, in light of Nara phonology, I have adopted Akimoto’s suggestion that
the correct name is Kumanuchi no Tani, meaning “winding dale.”
The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki Lad
Mikatsuhime, the wife of Ohosumihiko,® who resided in the township
of Inu, once made an inspection tour. When she came to this place,
she said, “Oh, beautiful is the [land of] Inu!” This is how the place
was named Inu. {The graphs were altered to become inu in 726.}
Unit of shrine households. {This unit belongs to Izumo.” The etymology
is the same as that described in the section on the district of Ou.}

® The full name of this god is Akafusuma Inu Ohosumihiko Sawake. Akafusuma
means “red quilt.” Fusuma is a pillow word for inu (to sleep). Because the name of
the township is Inu, the word akafusuma was chosen to modify the name. This
deity’s spouse, Ame no Mikatsuhime, is known by another name, Ame no
Mikajihime. Akimoto takes her to be a guardian deity of very capable sorceresses
(NKBT 2, 156).
% The original is vague here. It simply says Izumo nari, which means “It is
Izumo.” This could mean that the tax revenue from these shrine households was
allocated to the upkeep of the Kidzuki Shrine. Nonetheless, this interpretation is
tentative.

Kamunabi Yama. It is 3 miles northeast of the district office. Its height
is 2,300 feet, and its circumference is 4.7 miles. The shrine for the
Great God Sada is located at the foot of the mountain.
Taruhi Yama. It is 2.3 miles north of the district office. It is 1,700 feet
in height and 3.5 miles in circumference.
Ashitakano Yama.” It is 3.3 miles west of the district office. Its height
is 1,800 feet and its circumference is 2 miles. The soil is fertile. Hence,
it became a garden to enrich the peasants. There are no trees except
[the ones surrounding] a Shinto shrine at the top of the hill.
Tsuseno Yama. It is 3.3 miles west of the district office. It is 1,100 feet
in height, and 1.7 miles in girth. There are no trees. There is a marsh
on the ridge of the hill. It is 275 feet in circumference. Wisteria, bush
clover, reeds, and miscanthus grow there. Some plants grow tall, and
others are short, so that they cover the water. Mandarin ducks live there.
Ima Yama. It is 3.3 miles west of the district office. Its circumference
ise? oS miles:

The animals are as follows:
Eagle, peregrine falcon, copper pheasant, dove, pheasant, wild boar,
deer, hare, flying squirrel, fox, and monkey.
*” Texts differ in their reading of the name of this hill. In one interpretation, it
could be rendered as “high hill of the woman’s heart,” as my earlier translation has
it. More recently, I have adopted Akimoto’s emendation and changed the name
to Ashitakano (see ibid., 158).

[RIVERS, PONDS, BEACHES, AND ISLANDS]
Sada Gaha. This river has two sources. {The eastern source is the
Taku Gaha of the Shimane District. The western source comes from
the village of Watari in the district of Akika.} The two waters join
and flow south into Sada no Umi (Sada lake). The circumference of
the lake is about 2.3 miles. {Silver carp may be caught there.} This
lake is connected to the Iriumi. The length of the waterway is 825
feet, and its width is 55 feet.
Yamada Gaha. It derives its source from Taruhi Yama, 2.3 miles northwest of the district office. It flows south, emptying into the Iriumi.
Tada Gaha. Its source is in [the hills of] Ashitakano Yama, 3.3 miles
west of the district office. It flows south, emptying into the Iriumi.
Ohono Gaha. It originates in Ihato Yama, 4.3 miles west of the district
office. It flows south, emptying into the Iriumi.
Kayano Gaha. The source of this river is in the Ohotsugi Yama, 4.7
miles west of the district office. It flows south, emptying into the Iriumi.
Inu Gaha. The source of this river emanates from Inu Yama, 5.3 miles
west of the district office. It flows south, emptying into the Iriumi.
Nagaye Gaha. It originates in Kamunabi Yama, 3 miles northeast of
the district office. It flows south, emptying into the Iriumi. {No fish
are found in the above seven rivers. }!
Etomo no Ike (Etomo reservoir). {The old graphs were etomo. Now it is
recorded with the newly adopted graphs etomo.} It is 2 miles in circumference. Mandarin ducks, teal, wild geese, and crucian carp are
found there. Reeds, Indian rice, and sedge grow on all four sides. The
water lilies were abundant before the first year of Yoro [717]. Since
the second year [of Yoro] they have all died [for no apparent reason].
Not a single root remains. They say that there are many pieces of
100 Akimoto places this river after the description of Sada Gaha, above. His
rationale is that of geographical consistency (ibid., 160).

Etomo no Hama. It is 3,740 feet broad. There are houses on the eastern
and southern parts of the beach. In the west is a field, and to the
north is the Great Sea. Between the beach and the village there are
no rocks or plants at all, just piles of white sand. When there is a
strong wind, the sand swirls and falls like snow; some is scattered on
the ground like ants, while some covers the mulberry and hemp bushes.
There are two cliff walls, which have been tunnelled through.
{One opening is 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet high. The other
is 22 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet high} The stream that flows
through these tunnels empties into the Great Sea. {East of the stream
is the district of Shimane; [to the] west is the district of Akika.} It
[the stream] has a length of 990 feet, and a width of 15 feet, between
the river mouth and the rice field to the south. The water of the rice
field is the source of the stream. This is one of the sources of the
above-mentioned Sada Gaha (Sada river). Water from the rice field
of Watari village takes two routes: one south, the other north. According to the elders, Haso, the father of the Shimane District governor,
Kunimaro of the Kosebe no Omi, cut through the rocks in order to
drain the water from the rice fields.
'l The site of this reservoir is now covered with rice fields. Shell mounds surround
the site. We know the ancients believed that earthenware could appease the spirits
of the water, which may explain its appearance in the reservoir.

District of Tatenuhi
The district of Tatenuhi has four townships {twelve villages}, one
unit of single households, and one unit of shrine households.
Township of Saka: The graphs remained unchanged.
Township of Tatenuhi: The graphs remained unchanged.
Township of Kutami: The old graphs were kutami.
Township of Nuta: The old graphs were nuta.
{Each of the above four townships has three villages. }
Unit of single households.
Unit of shrine households.
Tatenuhi was named after the words of the god Kami Musubi (Spirit
of Fertility).'°’ He said, “Go and respectfully build a shrine for the
Lord of the Great Land in the likeness of my present residence. My
residence, the Grand Ameno Hisumi Palace, was constructed of thousands and thousands of yards of strong rope tied to the beams and
pillars of the building. The ends of the rope were left hanging beautifully
from the rooftree. Now, take the measurement of this palace, and
build one exactly like it for him.”!®
Thus, he appointed and dispatched Ame no Mitori, or the Noble
Bird of High Heaven, to be in charge of shield craft.!° The mission
came to Tatenuhi and initiated shield craft for the use of the shrine of
the Great God. Following this tradition, [the people of the district]
06 Tajihibe is one of the shinbetsu, or persons descended from indigenous gods
(ibid., 256).
'07 The following story is cited in the “Shaku Nihongi” (in Kuroita, Shintei zoho
kokushi taikei, 8:119).
'$ This story is written in the Takamagahara tradition. In it the god Kami
Musubi of the Takamagahara clans orders his followers to build a palace for the
Lord of the Great Land, that is, the god of Izumo. See Aoki, Izumo fudoki, 110,
117n. For a detailed analysis of the text with respect to the meaning of victor and
vanquished, see Mizuno, Izumo no kuni fudoki ronko, 789ff.
'° This deity is mentioned only in the Izumo fudoki.
The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki 117
make and dedicate shields and halberds to the deities [of the land].
This is why the district is called Tatenuhi, meaning “shield making.”
Township of Saka. It is located 1.5 miles east of the district office. A
multitude of deities gathered together, built a brewery, and fermented
rice wine in the river valley of Saka. They held festivals day after day
before they dispersed. Therefore, it is called Saka, meaning “rice wine.”
Township of Tatenuhi. The township of Tatenuhi is east of the district
office. {The etymology of the name of the township is the same as
that of the name of the district.} There is a cavern in the rock wall of
Nariiso on the north beach. Inside it is 15 feet square, 70 feet high,
and 70 feet wide. There is a small cave on the south side of the cavern.
Its opening is 6 feet in circumference and 2 feet in diameter. Nobody
knows how deep it is, because one cannot enter the cave.
Township of Kutami. It is 1.9 miles east of the district office. The Lord
of the Great Land made a tour in search of a site for a warehouse in
which to store the rice from Ame no Miihida (the heavenly shrine
field).!!° When he came to this place, he encountered a rain shower
and was drenched. “What a hill this is! I am soaking wet,” said the
god. Because of this, it is called Kutami, meaning “soaking wet.” {The

Township of Nuta. It is situated 2.7 miles west of the district office.
The god Unodzihiko said, “I will use this delicious water to moisten
my dried rice.” Thus, he named the area Nita, meaning “moist.” People
today, however, mistakenly call it Nuta. They should properly call the
place Nita. {The graphs were altered to nuta in 726.}

"107 iterally it means “heavenly rice field.” However, if the first word, ameno, is
taken to symbolize Yamato power, its connotation changes to “rice fields the yield
of which reverts to imperial possession.” The date of origin of the legend may be
near that of the reconciliation between the Izumo and Yamato powers.
118 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
There is one newly constructed temple in the township of Nuta. It
has a chapel in its precinct. The temple is located 2.2 miles west of
the district office. It was built by Izumo no Omi Ohota, the present
district governor of Tatenuhi.'"!

"7 None of the extant texts have graphs indicating the length of the cape. Kato
and Akimoto suggest 1 ri, 200 bu. If they are correct, the distance would be 2,750
feet. The texts also differ in their readings of the name of the cape. While Akimoto
calls it Otsufuri no Saki, Kato gives us Kozu no Saki. Hisamatsu reads it as Otsufuruhi.
My translation follows Hisamatsu. This is now considered to be the old name of the

District of Izumo
The district of Izumo has eight townships {twenty-three villages} and
one unit of shrine households {two villages} .!”°
Township of Takerube: The graphs remained unchanged.
Township of Shitsunu: The old graphs were shitsunu.
Township of Kafuchi: The graphs remained unchanged.
Township of Izumo: The graphs remained unchanged.
Township of Kidzuki: The old graphs were kidzuki.
Township of Inu: The old graphs were inu.

{Each of the above seven townships has three villages. }
Township of Uka: The graphs remained unchanged. {There are
two villages. }
Township of Kamube (shrine households): {There are two villages. }
The etymology of the name Izumo is the same as that given for the
name of the province.
Township of Takerube. It is 4.2 miles east of the district office. Formerly
this township was called the village of Uya because the god Uyatsube
came down from the Plain of High Heaven to the ridge of the hill in
this township. His shrine is located there. That is why it was called
the village of Uya. The name was changed to Takerube because the
emperor willed it. The emperor [posthumously known as Keiko], who
governed the realm from the Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, said, “The
name of my son, Yamato Takeru, must never be forgotten.”!”! Thus, he
"0 The district of IZumo encompassed the area west of the present-day city of
Hirata. In the eigthth century the Hino Kaha (Hinokawa) flowed west into the
Japan Sea, creating a boundary between Izumo and Kamuto districts. During the
Tokugawa period (1600-1867), the river changed course due to silting and began
to flow into the present-day Shinji Lake.
'! According to the Kojiki tradition, on his way home from the pacification of
Kumaso, Yamato Takeru entered Izumo and killed Izumo Takeru. Emperor Keiko
is then believed to have invested his sons with various territories there (Takeuchi,
Nihon kodai jinmei jiten, 744).
The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki 123
established Takerube. At the same time, Komi!’ of Kamuto no Omi,
was ennobled as Takerube no Omi. Ever since, Takerube no Omi and
his people have lived here. That is why it is called Takerube.
Township of Shitsunu. It is located 2 miles east of the district office.
The alternate name for Amatsu Kichikamitakahiko, a son of Kami
Musubi (Spirit of Fertility), is Komomakura Shitsunuchi.!”? This god
resides in the township. Therefore, it is called Shitsunu. {The graphs
were changed in 726.}
There are miyake (tax warehouses) located in this township.
Township of Kafuchi. It is 4.4 miles south of the district office. The
Great River Hi no Kaha runs through this township.'* Therefore, it is
called Kafuchi (riverside). There is a bank along the river. Its length
is 1,705 feet. {710 of the 1,705 feet have a width of 70 feet, and 950
feet of it have a width of 45 feet. }
Township of Izumo. This township provides the seat for the district
office. {The etymological explanation is the same as that given for
the name of the province. }
Township of Kidzuki. It is 9.5 miles northwest of the district office.
After the god Yatsukamidzu Omidzunu performed the land-pulling,
the deities [of the Yamato strain] gathered at the site, stamping the
earth so that they could build a palace for the Lord of the Great
Land.!* Therefore, it is called Kitsuki (constructed on stamped earth).
{The graphs were altered to kidzuki in 726.}
Township of Inu. It is 2.7 miles north of the district office. Inu
Ohosumihiko, a son of the Lord of the Great Water, has his shrine in
'22 Akimoto reads this name as Furune and identifies him as the Izumo Furune who
appears in the Nihon shoki. In my reading of this man’s name, I have followed Kato.
3 This god’s name involves a play on words. Komomakura is a pillow word for
shitsu nu “to sleep with [the pillow of... ].” The word chi connotes “spirit.” Nu
means “marsh.” Therefore, shitsunuchi means “the spirit of the Shitsunu Marsh.”
'244 This same river was also known as the Izumo no Ohokaha.
"5 The Kojiki identifies Yatsukamidzu Omidzunu as the grandfather of
Ohonamuchi (Okuninushi). However, it ignores Omidzunu’s participation in the
kunibiki (land-pulling). See NKBT 1, 91.
124 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
this township. That is why it is called Inu. {The graphs were altered
to inu in 726.}
Township of Mitami. It is 3.3 miles north of the district office. Waka
Futsunushi, a son of the Lord of the Great Land, served the Heavenly
Court as the supervisor of the Heaven-Owned Rice Fields after the
separation of the Plain of High Heaven and Earth.'”° This deity resides
in the township. Therefore, it is called Mitami, meaning “looking
after the Heavenly Royal Field.” {The graphs were altered to mitami
in 726.} There are tax granaries located in this township.
Township of Uka. It is 5.7 miles north of the district office. When the
Lord of the Great Land courted Ayatohime, a daughter of Kami
Musubi, the princess refused to meet him and fled [to Uka] to hide.
The lord pursued her and asked for her hand in marriage. Because of
this, this place is called Uka, meaning “looking for.”!”’
There is a ridge called Nadzuki on the beach north of this township. It is about 10 feet high. Pine trees grow at the top in such a way
that it looks as though the villagers are walking to and from the cliff
at dawn and dusk. The branches extend broadly, like men spreading
their arms. There is a cavern on the west side. Its height and breadth
are both 6 feet. Inside there is [an opening leading to] another cavern.
One cannot enter there. No one knows how deep it is. It is said that
anyone who dreams that he is approaching the cavern is destined to
die immediately. Therefore, the people call the ridge Yomi no Saka
(Downhill to the Other World) and the cavern Yomi no Ana (Cavern
of the Netherworld).!78
Township of Shrine Households. It is 3,960 feet northwest of the district
office. {The township belongs to the Izumo [Shrine]. The explanation

“Township of Ohono,” under “Akika District,” above).
7 Tt was customary for a woman, after receiving a marriage proposal, to hide
herself away and make her suitor try to find her. See the initial section of the
Harima fudoki for a more elaborate story of courting.

There is one temple newly established in the township of Kafuchi.
There is a chapel in the precinct. The temple is situated 4.4 miles

128 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
It passes through the village of Yokota in the district of Nita, which
includes the hamlets of Yokota, Mitokoro, Misaha, and Fuse. Then it
flows into the village of Hikino where it forms the boundary with the
district of Ohohara. [Along the border] it passes through the townships of Kisuki, Hi, Yashiro, and Kamuhara, finally arriving at the
village of Tagi where it serves as the boundary between the districts of
Ohohara and Izumo. In the village of Tagi it passes through the hamlets
of Kafuchi and Izumo; then it takes a northward route. Further on, it
bends to the west, passing [through] the townships of Inu and Kidzuki.
It empties into Kamuto Lake. The Great River of Izumo consists of
the lower part of the so-called Hi no Kaha [system].
The soil is fertile on both sides of the river. In some places rich
fields provide the people with abundant harvests of grain, mulberry,
and hemp. Ayu, salmon, trout, dace, mullet, and sea eel are abundant
in deep and shallow water. The people who live in the five districts
[of Izumo, Kamuto, Ihishi, Ohohara, and Nita] between the river
mouth and the village of Yokota, the upper part of the Great River,
make a living from the water as well as from the land. From the first
month to the third, lumber is transported down the river, while boats
are rowed up and down [to inspect] the [timber] rafts.
The Little Stream of Ohomi. The stream rises in Misaki Yama of Izumo.
It flows north, emptying into the Great Sea. {A few ayu are obtained

and joins the Iriumi. {Crucian carp are obtained there. }
The water of both inlets comes from the rice fields.
East of the inlets is the Iriumi. It is surrounded by large stretches
of flat fields on the west, north, and south. Copper pheasants, doves,
teal, wild geese, and mandarin ducks are often seen in the area.
The products of this place are the same as those listed in the [section]

Township of Yamuya. It is 2 miles northeast of the district office. Yamuyahiko, a son of Adzisuki Takahiko, is enshrined there. This is why the
place is called Yamuya. {The graphs were altered to yamuya in 726.}
Township of Yano. It is 1.2 miles north of the district office. Young
Princess Yano, a daughter of the god Susanowo, was residing there.
Ohonamuchi, the Lord of the Great Land, who desired to marry her,
had a house built at this place. The place was named after the princess.
Township of Takakishi. It is 3,300 feet northeast of the district office.
Adzisuki Takahiko, a son of the Lord of the Great Land, wailed day
and night. His father constructed a tall building in which Adzisuki
could live. The Lord of the Great Land attached a long ladder to the
building so that his son could climb up and down when he pleased.
Thus, he reared and consoled Adzisuki. This is how the township
came to be known as Takakishi [meaning “high cliffs, or a ladder”].
{The graphs were altered to takakishi in 726.}
Township of Koshi. This township is the seat of the district office. At
the time of Izanami, a reservoir was constructed using the water of

work on the project became residents of this area. That is why the
township is called Koshi.
Township of Namesa. It is 2.7 miles southwest of the district office.
Young Princess Suseri,!** a daughter of the God Susanowo, was living

temple was built by Kamuto no Omi.
Another new temple has been constructed in the township of Koshi.

'S’Kaha-ahi, which is a compound consisting of two distinct words, kaha (river)
and ahi (to meet), is a prime example of sound changes in Nara phonology. Native
Japanese words (Yamato kotoba) never employed two consecutive vowels in word
formation. During the Nara period, however, when many Chinese words were
adopted into the Japanese lexicon, rapid sound changes occurred. Thus, the words
waga (my) and ihe (home) came to form a new word, wagihe (my home) by
dropping the last vowel of waga. In the case of the name of the township mentioned in the text, the combination of the words kaha and ahi formed a new name
for the village, Kahahi (where rivers meet) by dropping the final a of kaha. I have
indicated this change by first transcribing the word as it appears in the text (its
reading according to the commentary) in “historical kana orthography,” and then
writing the newly formed word in brackets. The modern reading of the same
graphs is kawai.

'58 The rest of the province, that is, the districts of Ihishi, Nita, and Ohohara,
had no access to a large body of water. They were situated in more mountainous
areas than those in which the foregoing districts were located.
459 The district of Kamuto was of medium size, so it had four officials.
‘60 The SSR lists the names Kibi no Asomi and Kibi no Omi but not Kibibe no
Omi. However, the Shosoin Archives list one Kibibe no Omi and forty-three Kibibe.

Ihishi was named after the goddess Ihishitsube, who is enshrined
there. Thus, it is known by the name of [hishi.
Township of Kumatani. It is located 8.6 miles northeast of the district
office. The elders say that Kushi Inadami Toyomanurahime [guardian
goddess of the rice fields]!*! sought a place to give birth to her child in
this area. When she passed this township, the goddess said, “How
deep and well hidden this valley is!” That is why the township is
called Kumatani, meaning “deeply hidden valley.”
Township of Mitoya. It is situated 8 miles northeast of the district office. There is a gate to commemorate the Lord of the Great Land in
this township. Therefore, it is called Mitoya, meaning “holy gate.”!®
{The graphs were altered to mitoya in 726.]
Township of Ihishi. It is 3.9 miles east of the district office. This is the

name of Ihishi. {The graphs were altered to thishi in 726.}
Township of Tane. This township provides the site for the district office.
Ohonamuchi, the Lord of the Great Land, and the god Sukuna Hikona
sowed rice seeds at this place while on an inspection tour together.
Thus, it is called Tane, meaning “seeds.” {The graphs were altered to
tane in 726. }}!®
Township of Susa. It is 6.3 miles west of the district office. The god
Susanowo said, “Though this land is small, it is good land for me to
own.!* I would rather have my name [associated with this land than]
with rocks or trees.” After saying this, he left his spirit to stay quietly

'63 This story suggests that the rice seeds were sown directly onto the soil of the
field. By the time of the Izumo fudoki, however, more advanced techniques were
already prevalent. Seedlings were transplanted from nurseries into the fields. Therefore, the story is considered to be a product of a much earlier time when “slashand-burn” agriculture was still practiced.

Township of Fuse: The old graphs were fuse.
Township of Misaha: The graphs remained unchanged.
Township of Yokota: The graphs remained unchanged.
{Each of the above four townships has three villages. }
Nita was named for the words of [the god Ohonamuchi,] the Lord
of the Great Land. He said, “This land is neither too large nor too
small. Trees are luxuriant on the upper reaches of the Hi no Kaha,
reeds and bushes on the lower reaches. It is also suitably moist land.”!”
Township of Mitokoro. This township is the seat of the district office.
Ohonamuchi said, “The rice fields are good here. Hence, I would
have them as my own.” Therefore, it was named Mitokoro, meaning
“noble territory.”!”
Township of Misaha. It is located 8.3 miles southwest of the district
office. Adzisuki Takahiko, a son of the Lord of the Great Land, was
born dumb. Unable to speak, he cried day and night, even after his
beard grew long.!’’ His father took him on board ship and navigated
around the island to console him. But Adzisuki did not stop wailing.
The Lord of the Great Land sought to learn the will of the superior
gods in a dream: “Tell me why my son cries so, I pray.” That night, the
Lord of the Great Land saw his son speaking in his dream. Awakening
immediately, he spoke to his son. And the son uttered a word, “misaha.”
4 This is Otoyama of Izumo no Omi, the heir of Hiroshima. He was promoted
to Outer Junior 8th Rank, Upper Grade, by the ninth month of 734, thatis, the year
following the compilation of Izumo fudoki (Dai Nihon komonjo, 1:593).
5 Suitably moist land: Nitashi in the original. This is an ancient word, the
oldest use of which is found in the Izumo fudoki.
176 The word mitokoro, with the honorific prefix mi, could mean “divine territory.”
'7 A strikingly similar story is found in the Kojiki (NKBT 1, 197).
146 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
“What place do you call by this name, my son?” asked the Lord of the
Great Land. Adzisuki left his father, crossed a river of pebbles, and
walked up a slope. When he reached the upper part of the hill, he
stopped, and said, “This is the place, my lord.”
There was a spring at that place. Adzisuki bathed and purified his
body with the spring water. This is why the kuni no miyatsuko began
using the water of the spring to perform the customary ablutions before going to the Court to present the kamuyogoto. [Also] because of
Adzisuki, a woman with child will not eat rice grown in this village. If
she eats the rice, [she knows] her child will be born dumb. The place
was named after the word misaha.{The graphs were altered to misaha
in 726.} There are tax granaries in this township.
Township of Yokota. It is 7 miles southeast of the district office. According to the elders, there were about four tan of rice fields in this

sense of it is perhaps something like “moorish” land.
182 According to the Kojiki and the Nihon shoki, this is the place where Susanowo
killed Yamata no Orochi (the Eight-Headed Serpent). See NKBT 1, 85.
'85 Tamatsukuri: The reading of this word follows Akimoto. Kato reads this part
of the text as tamanohe. Tamatsukuri literally means “jewel making,” so the god
may have been a guardian of lapidaries.

Shitafuru Yama. It is 7.6 miles south of the district office. According to
the story the elders tell, a shark fell in love with Princess Tamahi, a
deity who resided in the village of Ai. It climbed the hills by way of
the Great Hi no Kaha. The princess blocked the river with rocks so
that the shark could not proceed. The shark, unable to approach his
goddess, yearned for her in vain. That is why it is called Shitafuru
Yama (yearning hill).!**

District of Ohohara
The district of Ohohara has eight townships {twenty-four villages}.
Township of Kamuhara: The graphs remained unchanged.
Township of Yashiro: The old graphs were yashiro.
Township of Yauchi: The old graphs were yauchi.
Township of Sase: The graphs remained unchanged.
Township of Ayo: The old graphs were ayo.
Township of Ushiho: The old graphs were ushiho.
Township of Kisuki: The graphs remained unchanged.
Township of Hi:!! The old graph was hi.
{Each of the above eight townships has three villages.}
Ohohara was named after a vast field of about six acres. The field
is located 3.5 miles northeast of the district office. This is why it is
called Ohohara, meaning “large field.” In ancient times, the district
'8° Nita was gegun, hence there were only three officials.
'° According to the Kojiki and the Nihon shoki, Emperor Suinin bestowed the
title Toritori no Miyatsuko (Head of the Bird Catcher Clan) upon the person who
caught the swan, and established Homuchibe, naming it after the prince who
gained the power of speech after seeing the swan (NKBT 1, 184; “Nihon shoki,” in
Shintei zoho kokushi taikei, ed. Kuroita Katsumi [Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kobunkan,
1935], 1:184). The SSR lists Homuchi as one of the names that is not in the SSR
(Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku, 228, 351).
'! Although there are two graphs given here, most commentators read them as
a one-syllable word, hi. However, some linguists believe that all ancient Japanese
words were disyllabic. If one follows that theory, the graphs should be read as hi-i.
A similar phenomenon may be observed in the name of the province of Ki, which
was usually transcribed with two graphs and read as ki-i.
The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki 151
office was situated in the [middle of the] field. Today people still call
it Ohohara. {The place where the district office is now located is
called the village of Hi, or Hi no Sato.}
Township of Kamuhara. It is situated 2.9 miles north of the district
office. According to the elders, this is the place where the Lord of the
Great Land stored his divine treasures, hence it should be called
Kamutakara (sacred treasures). People today, however, wrongly call
it Kamuhara.
Township of Yashiro. It is 3.5 miles north of the district office. The Lord
of the Great Land erected a target mound and practiced archery at
this place. Therefore, it is called Yashiro, meaning “archery ground.”
{The graphs were altered to yashiro in 726.}
Township of Yauchi. It is 3.5 miles northeast of the district office. According to the elders, this is the place where the Lord of the Great Land
would shoot arrows. Therefore, it has been called Yauchi, meaning
“arrow shooting.” {The graphs were altered to Yauchi in 726.}
Township of Sase. It is 3.2 miles east of the district office. According to
the elders, Susanowo danced there. When he danced, he wore leaves
of sase on his head. While Susanowo was dancing, the leaves fell to
the ground. Thus, the place was named Sase.!”
Township of Ayo. It is 4.4 miles southeast of the district office. According
to the elders, there once lived a man who tilled the reclaimed land of
this township. One day a one-eyed devil began to eat him up. His
aged parents hid themselves in a bamboo bush. The bush appeared to be
shaking. Seeing this, the man shouted “Ayo! Ayo!” (meaning “Watch
out! You are making it rustle”) Therefore, the township was named
after the dying words of the man [who was eaten up by the devil].!”
Township of Ushiho. It is 5.4 miles east of the district office. According
to the elders, Unodzihiko, a sea god, who deeply resented his father,
'2 The dance was a type of kagura, a Shinto dance. The exact nature of the
plant named sase is not known.
'3 This story suggests that the notion of filial piety was introduced to this area
before the compilation of the report. One-eyed devils are rare in the early Japanese
legends, and the next story gives a quite contrary account in light of the Confucian
ethic.
152 The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki
Sugane, raised a high tide in the north sea of Izumo so that his father
would drown. The tide reached as far as this township. That is why
the place is called Ushiho, meaning “tide.” {The graphs ushiho were
applied in 726.}
In the village of Yubuchi, northwest of the township, there is a hot
spring in the small stream of Suga. {The spring has no name. There is
another hot spring on the upper reaches of the same stream in the
hamlet of Kema. This spring has no specific name either. }
Township of Kisuki. It is 2.7 miles south of the district office. The Lord
of the Great Land said, “I will not let those eighty deities stay in this
land, which is surrounded by beautiful green mountains.”!” Thus, he
launched a campaign against them. When he had chased his enemies
as far as this place, the Lord of the Great Land overtook them. Therefore, the place was named Kisuki, meaning “to overtake.”
Township of Hi [Hi no Sato]. It provides the seat of the district office.
Hihayahiko, the God of Rapid Fire, is enshrined in this township.
That is why it is called Hi. {The graphs were altered to hi in 726.}
[TEMPLES]
A new temple. It is located in the township of Hi. Its site is 1,650 feet
south of the district office. There is a chapel in the precinct. {Five
priests attend this temple.} The temple was built by the district governor, Mushimaro, of the Suguribe no Kimi.!%
A new temple. Another new temple is located in the township of Yauchi.
It is 3.8 miles northeast of the district office. There is a pagoda in the
precinct. {One priest resides in this temple.} It was built by the former
assistant district governor, Oshishima, of the Nukatabe no Omi. {He
was a cousin of the current assistant district governor, Ikomi.}!%7
'94 Similar episodes are found in the Harima fudoki (see HAR, “Village of Iwa”
under the “District of Shikama”).
' Eighty deities are yasogami in the original. They are said to be brothers of
Ohonamuchi (NKBT 1, 91-97).
'6 At the end of the section his name is written Suguribe no Omi.
'’ Nukatabe no Omi Oshishima was one of the stronger local magistrates of this
area.
The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki 153
A new nunnery. It is in the township of Hi. Its location is 1,650 feet
northeast of the district office. There is a golden hall in the precinct.

in order to defend himself from the wicked eighty deities. Therefore,
the place was named Kinahi, meaning (“hidden fortress”).'”
Takasa Yama. It is located 3.5 miles north of the district office. Its
height is 1,000 feet and its circumference 1.7 miles. Oak and camellia
grow on the north side. The other three sides are covered with grass.
According to the elders, Awohata Sakusahiko [Hemp God] sowed hemp
seeds at the top of the hill. Therefore, it was called Takasa, meaning
“hemp on high.” The spirit of this deity is enshrined atop the mountain.
Suga Yama. It is 6.5 miles northeast of the district office. {Cypress and
Richard bald cypress grow there. }7°
Funawoka Yama. It is 5.3 miles northeast of the district office. This
hill is the ship that the god Wanasahiko [who came from Aha] pulled
in and set [upon the land]. Therefore, the hill is called Funawoka,
meaning “boat hill.”?°!
Mimuro Yama. It is 6.5 miles northeast of the district office. This is the
place where Susanowo had a temporary chamber built in which he
stayed the night. Therefore, it was named Mimuro, meaning “noble
chamber.”?”
The plants that grow in the hills and fields in this district are [as follows]:

'° Hi, from the word Kinahi, is written in otsurui-gana and means “to hide.”
20 The Kojiki records a legend relating the name Suga to the word for Susanowo,
the deity who is believed to have come to this place (ibid., 140, 232n).
*°! For a similar tale about the name Funawoka, see HAR, “Village of Iwa,”
under the “District of Shikama.”
202'The word mimuro does not necessarily refer to a building. The word muro has
the connotation “grotto.”
