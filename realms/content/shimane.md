The Realm of Shimane is located along the Sea of Japan in western Honshu, encompassing both coastal plains and the mountainous interior of the Chūgoku region. Historically, the area was divided between Izumo, Iwami, and Oki Provinces, with Izumo being the most culturally prominent due to its legendary shrines and mythological associations. The prefecture is renowned for its spiritual heritage, particularly Shinto worship, with shrines that rank among the most important in Japan, including ichinomiya (provincial chief shrines) and Myojin Taisha.
