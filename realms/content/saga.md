The Realm of Saga is a realm in Japan.

Old provinces: Hizen.

The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki
lelet has eleven districts {seventy townships, which contain 187
villages}, eighteen posting-stations {all of these stations have
“small-road” status}, twenty beacons {all of these beacons are of the
“small-province” size}, one fortress, and two temples {priests reside
in both temples}.!
Formerly, Hizen and Higo provinces constituted one administrative
unit [called Hi no Kuni]. In the remote past, during the reign of
Prince Mimaki [posthumously known as Emperor Sujin], who governed
the realm from Midzukaki Palace at Shiki, there were two Tsuchikumo
[leaders] named Uchisaru and Unasaru living in Asakuna Mountain
of the district of Mashiki in Higo. These men and their numerous
followers disobeyed princely commands and refused to submit to his
lordship. The Court therefore issued an edict and sent a man named
Take Wokumi to annihilate them. Take Wokumi is the forebear of the
Hi no Kimi family.’
Upon receiving this royal command, Take Wokumi conducted a campaign and destroyed all of the foes. Afterward he made an inspection
' Inoue Michiyasu’s suggestion that the number of villages was 187 is accepted
by both Akimoto and Hisamatsu. On the other hand, “Ritsusho zanpen” in the
Shiseki shuran, gives a number of 181. See Kondo Binjo, ed., Kaitei shiseki shuran
(Tokyo: Kondo Kappanjo, 1902), 27:109; and Inoue Michiyasu, Hizen fudoki shinko
(Osaka: Kojinsha, 1934), 1. The fortress was located at Kinoyama on the northeastern border of Hizen Province.
? Prince Mimaki is thought to have been the first Japanese ruler to apotheosize
the various deities in his sphere of influence. For more about Mimaki, see HIT,
under the “District of Nihihari”; HAR, “Kuzuno,” under the “District of “Sayo”;
and Nihongi, part 1, 251-52.

tour of the [conquered] area. The sun was setting when he arrived at
Shirakami Yama in the district of Yatsushiro, and so he spent the
night there. During the night he saw a fire in the sky. After a while,
the fire descended to the top of the mountain [on which he stood].
Take Wokumi was awed by the sight, and he hastily journeyed to the
royal court to make a report. He said, “At the august command of
your lordship, I carried out an expeditionary campaign against the
recalcitrants in the distant west. Before the fighting ensued, however,
the defiant enemies perished. What could have caused this except
your lordship’s majestic power?” He also described the way the fire
had burned [on top of the mountain].
The prince said, “We have never heard anything like what you
are telling [us now]. I will name the place Hi no Kuni (land of fire)
since the fire descended there from the sky.” The prince rewarded
Take Wokumi’s bravery by bestowing on him the kabane of Hi no Kimi,
and he made him governor of that land. Thus, the land was named
Hi no Kuni. Sometime later the land was divided in half [creating]
two provinces, Michi no Kuchi (Hizen) [front half of Hi no Kuni] and
Michi no Shiri (Higo) [rear half of Hi no Kuni].
At another time, Prince Ohotarashi [posthumously known as Emperor Keiko], who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace in
Makimuku, punished the Kumaso and toured the land of Tsukushi.
He embarked for Hi no Kuni at Hinagare no Ura of Ashikita. While
he was crossing the sea, the sun set and night fell. It was so dark that
[the pilot] could not navigate [the ship]. Thereupon the prince caught
a glimpse of light in the sky. The prince commanded the pilot, saying,
“Proceed in the direction of the light.” The pilot obeyed the princely
command and managed to reach the shore safely.’
“What is that land called, where the fire burns? Who is tending
that fire?” asked the prince. The people of the area answered, “That
is the direction of Hi no Mura (fire village) of the district of Yatsushiro
in Hi no Kuni. But we do not know who is tending [the fire].” The
prince said to his advisors, “That is no ordinary fire. It must not have

the central and southern regions of Kyushu. See BUN, note 6; and Nihongi, part |,

been set by man. Now I know why this land is called Hi no Kuni (land
of [divine] fire).”*
District of Ki
The district of Ki has six townships {seventeen villages}, one postingstation {which has “small-road” status}, and one fortress.’
On an inspection tour to Tsukushi, Prince Ohotarashi [posthumously known as Emperor Keiko], who governed the realm from
Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, stayed at the temporary palace of Kaura
in the district of Miwi. When he gazed toward Ki no Yama, he saw
that mist covered the mountain. The prince said, “That land should
be named Kiri (mist).” Later people changed it to Ki. Ki is now the
name of the district.®
Shrine of the God of Nagawoka. {It is east of the district office.} The
same prince [Ohotarashi] came upon [the place called] Sakadono no
Izumi on his return from his temporary palace at Kaura. When his
meal was served, his armor took on an unusual brightness. The prince
asked Uwesaka of the Urabe family to divine the meaning [of this
phenomenon]. Uwesaka said, “There is a god in the land, and he
desires to possess your lordship’s armor.”
“If that is the case, I will dedicate my armor at the shrine of that
god,” said the prince. “The armor shall become an eternal treasure of
this shrine.” The shrine thus was named Nagayo (eternity). Later
* Advisors: For the graphs translated as “advisors” or “councillors,” which read
as mahetsu kimi, see the glossary. Also see HIT, “introductory section.”
> Fortress: Most extant texts eliminate the word “fortress” at this point. Akimoto
adds it based on the description given at the beginning of the HIZ. In fact, the
remains of a fortress have been discovered on the hill now called Kinoyama, and
the NS includes an account of two Paekche refugees who were commissioned by
Emperor Tenji to construct a fortress at Ki (Nihongi, part 2, 283-84).
° The district of Miwi was the eastern neighbor of the district of Ki. The name
of the temporary palace (or camp), Kaura, strongly suggests a Korean origin.
" According to ancient beliefs, to take one’s meal at a certain place had a
magical effect on the ownership of the site (see HAR, note 103).
The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki DIS
people changed its name to Nagawoka. Today only the helmet and
fragments of the armor remain [there].*
Sakadono Spring. {It is east of the district office.} In the beginning of
the ninth month, the water of this spring becomes cloudy and tastes
sour. Its smell prevents one from drinking it. The water becomes normal
again during the first month. Only then do people drink it. Thus, the
spring came to be called Sakawi no Izumi. Later, people changed the
name to Sakadono no Izumi (brewery spring).?
Township of Himekoso. There is a river in this township called Yamaji
Gaha. Its source is in the hills north of this district, and from there it
flows south to meet the Great River of Miwi. In the remote past, an
evil deity resided on the west bank of this river. Many travellers were
killed by the deity. About half of the travellers who passed this way
survived but the other half perished. In order to learn the cause of
this curse, divination was employed. The answer came, “Find a man
named Kazeko, a resident of Munakata District in Tsukushi no Michi
no Kuchi [eighth-century Chikuzen Province], and let him serve at
my shrine. If my wish is thus fulfilled, my violent spirit will be calmed.”
Kazeko was sent for and made priest of this deity’s shrine.'°
Kazeko dedicated a hata (banner), and prayed, “If this deity sincerely desires my service, may this banner fly in the wind and drop at
his feet.” With this, [the priest] raised the banner high and let it fly in
the wind. The cloth flew as far as the grove of Himekoso, in the
district of Mihara, where it landed. The banner then flew back from
® The former Nagawoka Shrine, now renamed Nagayo Shrine, is located in
Nagayo-mura. According toa local tradition, the object of worship there is a suit of
armor. This tale probably reflects a political accommodation reached between the
earthly god (early settlers) and Ohotarashi (the intruding people).
* The site referred to is a mineral spring located near the present-day Tosu City.
It is probable that the water was used to brew wine, and thus the spring was named
Sakawi (rice-wine well).
'© Texts differ as to this man’s name. Some call him Ajiko, while others call him
Kazeko. If he was Ajiko, he was the founder of the Mima no Kimi (or Minuma no
Kimi) family. The Mima no Kimi family claimed descent from the Mononobe clan
and was in charge of the Munakata Shrine. See note 30, below; and HAR, “Village of Ahaha,” under the “District of Kako,” for cursing gods.
254 The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki
the grove and landed near Yamaji Gaha. [By studying the course the
banner had travelled, Kazeko] determined the god’s dwelling place."
That night Kazeko had a dream in which a kutsubiki (weaving
tool) and a tatari (spinning wheel) appeared to be dancing and pushing
him around. The dream [told] him that the deity was female. Thereupon, he built a shrine to the goddess. Since then [the deity has been
appeased]; travellers are no longer killed. Thus, the place came to be
called Himekoso (shrine of the princess). Himekoso is now the name
of this township."
District of Yabu
The district of Yabu has four townships {twelve villages}, and one
beacon. In the past, Prince [Ohotarashi], who governed the realm from
Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, came upon this area while on a hunting
trip. A hunting dog belonging to one of the royal huntsmen rushed in,
barking at the place where the peasants of this district had gathered
to receive the prince. Among the crowd of villagers was a pregnant
woman. When this woman stared at the dog, it stopped barking. Thus,
the place was named Inu no Koye Yamu (dog’s barking ceased). The
present name [of this] district, Yabu, is a corrupt form of Yamu.”
Township of Tosu. {It is east of the district office.} During the reign of
Prince Homuda [posthumously known as Emperor Oujin], who governed the realm from the Shining Palace at Karu Shima, [people of
this district] built an aviary where they raised many kinds of birds.
The birds were presented to the Mikado (Court). That is why the
district was named Toya (birdhouses). People later changed the name
to Tosu (birds’ nests).
Township of Watari. {It is south of the district office.} In the remote
past, the ford of the Miwi River was so broad that both men and cattle
'' The material of hata was perhaps the mulberry. Note that in the Kyushu
dialect hata means “kite.” Himekoso was a weaving goddess worshiped by Korean
people in the area (Inoue Michiyasu, Hizen fudoki shinko, 28-35).
" Kutsuhiki, or kutsubiki, is a Korean-style weaving tool. Tatari is a Korean-style
spinning wheel.

had difficulty crossing. When Prince [Ohotarashi], who governed the
realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, came to this place on a
hunting trip, he established a boatyard on Ikuha Yama and a rudder
factory on Kaura Yama. A boat was built, which made it possible for
people and animals to cross the ford. That is why the township was
named Watari (ferry/crossing).'
Township of Sayama. {It is south of the district office.} The same prince
[Ohotarashi] came to this area and stayed at his temporary palace on
the hill of this township. When he walked around the palace [camp]
ground to see the view in all directions, the visibility was extremely
good. Thus, the place was named Sayake [clearly visible]. The present
name [of this] township, Sayama, is a corrupt form of Sayake.
District of Mine
The district of Mine has six townships {seventeen villages}, and one
posting-station {which has “small-road” status}.
In the past, this district formed a single jurisdiction together with
the [territory of the present-day] district of Kamusaki. Later, Tori of
the Ama no Atahi petitioned [the prince] to divide it into two districts,
Kamusaki and Mine. The district of Mine was named after the village
of Mine in the district of Kamusaki.!*
'4 Tkuha Yama is the present-day Takai Dake, the eastern boundary of Ukihagun. Kaura Yama is the present-day Kora Yama in Kurume City.
'S Perhaps this is the posting-station of Kiriyama mentioned in the Wamyosho.
See Kyoto Daigaku Kokugo Kokubungaku Kenkyushitsu, ed., Shohon shusei Wamyo
ruijusho [Wamyosho], 2 vols. (Kyoto: Rinsen Shoten, 1968), 1:854.
'6 This simple statement may conceal layers of human history that often involved
warfare. Recent archaeological research indicates that from the time of the early
Yayoi period the area flourished, with complex, wealthy settlements, often surrounded by moats. See Mark Hudson and Gina L. Barnes, “Yoshinogari: A Yayoi
Settlement in Northern Kyushu,” Monumenta Nipponica, 46, no. 2 (Summer
1991):214ff. The name Amano Atahi also reads as Amabe no Atahi. As the word
ama, or amabe, means “seafarers,” the man named Ama no Atahi may have been
a new appointee of the Yamato Court. It is probable that Ama no Atahi came to
the area, appropriated a portion of the old territory of Kamusaki, and established a
new district.
256 The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki
Township of Mononobe. {It is south of the district office.} There is a
shrine to the god Futsunushi, [the guardian god] of the Mononobe family.
In the past, Princess Kashikiya [posthumously known as Empress Suiko],
who governed the realm from Woharida Palace, made Prince Kume general of the expeditionary forces moving against Silla. At her majesty’s
command, the prince [Kume] came to Tsukushi and had the Wakamiyabe people of the Mononobe family build in this village a shrine for
the god [Futsunushi]. Thus, the township was named Mononobe.”
Township of Ayabe. {It is north of the district office.} In the remote
past, Prince Kume came to this place en route to his campaign against
Silla. He brought with him Ayahito (continental immigrants) from
the camp of Oshinumi in Yamato. The prince let these men make
weapons. That is how the township came to be called Ayabe (immigrant workers’ group).
Township of Meta. {It is south of the district office.} There is a well in
this township, the water of which tastes salty. [Seaweed grows at the
bottom of the well.] In the remote past, when he went there on a
hunting trip, Prince Ohotarashi noticed the seaweed and called the
well Menaruwi [seaweed-growing well]. Today, people call the well
Metawi, a corrupt form of Menaruwi. Meta also became the name of
this township.”
District of Kamusaki
The district of Kamusaki has nine townships {twenty-six villages}, one
posting-station, one beacon, and one temple. {A priest resides there. }”°
In the remote past, a violent god lived in this district. This god
'T Futsunushi was a war god and the guardian of the Mononobe family. See
HIT, “District of Shida.” Prince Kume was the son of Prince Tachibana (known as
Emperor Yomei, r. c. 585). For Empress Suiko, see HAR, note 87.
'§ According to the NS, the Ayahito from the Oshinumi camp were the descendants of prisoners of war taken from Silla. See Nihon shoki (Sakamoto et al.),
1:617, 30n; and Nihongi, part 1, 242, 2n.

follows Hisamatsu’s reading.
*® This posting-station was located southeast of the present-day Kanzaki railroad
station. The area is adjacent to “Yoshinogari,” the archaeological site, which

used to kill many travellers who passed through the area. After Prince
[Ohotarashi], who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, toured this area, the deity was appeased, and it has done no
harm since. Thus, the district is called Kamusaki.!
Township of Mine. {It is west of the district office.} There is a river in
this district. Its source is in a hill in the northern part of the district.
It flows south and empties into the sea. Ayu are obtained there. When
he toured this area, the same prince [Ohotarashi] sailed upstream
from the mouth of the river and stopped at this village overnight. [On
the following morning] the prince said, “I had a peaceful sleep last
night. This village should be called Mineyasu (august sleep in peace).”
It was then named Mine (august sleep). {The graphs were altered to
mean “three roots.” }?
Township of Funaho. {It is west of the district office.} When the same
prince [Ohotarashi] came to this area, all the people of the township
got into boats and sailed to the ford of Mine Gaha where they received
him. That is why the township was named Funaho (boat sails). Four
rocks at this ford are said to be the anchors of royal boats. One of the
rocks is {six feet high and five feet in diameter}. Another is {eight
feet high and five feet in diameter}. If a barren woman prayed to
these two rocks, she would conceive and bear a child without fail.
One of the remaining two rocks is {four feet high and five feet in
diameter}. The other is {three feet high and four feet in diameter}.
In times of drought, [people] pray to the latter two rocks. [It is said
that] the prayers will bring rain without fail.”
attracted national attention in the spring of 1989 (see Hudson and Barnes,
“Yoshinogari,” 228-31).
*! The story seems to imply the existence of an independent local leader. See
HAR, “Village of Ahaha,” under the “District of Kako”; and HIZ, “Township of
Himekoso,” under the “District of Ki.”
»? The ayu, amember of the Plecoglossid family, is considered the king of edible
fresh-water fish in Japan. See HAR, note 10; and BUN, note 8. Mouth of this river:
Most commentators read the graph in the original as minato and interpret it as
meaning “river mouth.” Today the graph means “lake” (see glossary, under minato).
23 This site is unidentified today. It may have been buried beneath silt deposits
and forgotten.
258 The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki
Township of Kamata. {It is west of the district office.} The same prince
[Ohotarashi] also stayed the night in this township. When his meal
was served, flies buzzed about noisily. The prince complained, “The
flies are buzzing so noisily.” Thus, the township was named Kama
(noisy). The present name, Kamata, was derived from Kama.
Kotoki Woka. {It is twenty feet high and five hundred feet in circumference. It is south of the district office.} This area was once a flat
field. There were no hills anywhere nearby. Prince Ohotarashi commented on this, [saying,] “There should be a hill in such a place as
this.” He then ordered his men to construct a mound at the site.
When it was finished, the prince climbed to the top of the knoll for a
banquet. After enjoying the banquet, Prince Ohotarashi propped up
his zither. Thereupon, the zither turned into a camphor tree. {The
tree is now fifty feet high and thirty feet in girth.} That is why the
place is called Kotoki Woka (zither-tree hill).”4
Township of Miyako. {It is southwest of the district office.} The same
prince built his temporary palace there. Thus, the township is called
Miyako (palace site).
District of Saka
The district of Saka has six townships {nineteen villages}, one postingstation, and one temple.”
In the remote past, there was a camphor tree growing in this village
[in this district]. It was tall and had abundant leaves. In the morning
its shadow covered Kamakaha Yama in the district of Kishima; in the
evening its shadow covered Kusayoko Yama in the district of Yabu.
When he came to this place, Prince Yamato Takeru admired the flourishing camphor tree, and said, “This land must be named Saka [expressed by a graph, meaning ‘flourishing’].” That is why the district
*4 Perhaps this mound was built as a stage for religious rituals. It is now a flat
field. Koto is one of the magical instruments used by shamans (see HAR, note 109;
Aoki, “Empress Jingu,” 22-23; and Aoki, Izumo fudoki, 55).
*’ The six townships are Kisaki, Kose, Fukamizo (or Fukamiso), Wotsu, Yamada,
and Bosho (Wamyosho, 660, 838). The posting-station is probably the one identified in the Wamyosho as the posting-station of Saka (ibid., p. 854).
The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki 259
was named Saka. The graph was later altered, and now it is written
[in two graphs of uncertain meaning].”°
[There is another theory about the etymology of the name Saka.]
West of the district office is the river known as Saka Gaha. Its sources
are the hills in the northern part of this district, and from there it
flows south to the sea. Ayu are obtained from this river. According to
the latter theory, once upon a time a violent god who harassed passersby
resided in the upper part of this river. The god [habitually] killed half
of [the passersby] and spared half. Under these circumstances
Ohoarata, the forebear of the agatanushi (local magistrate) of this area,
asked two Tsuchikumo women named Ohoyamadame and Sayamadame to divine [the cause of the god’s violence].”?
[After seeking the reason for the god’s curse], the women reported
to Ohoarata, saying, “If you take clay [obtained] in the village of
Shimoda and make figurines of men and horses, and then dedicate
them to this deity, it will be appeased.” Following the women’s advice,
Ohoarata dedicated [the figurines] to this god. The [violent] god
accepted his offering and was appeased.”
“Wise are these women,” proclaimed Ohoarata. “I will now call
this land Sakahime (wise women).” The district thus was named
Sakahime. Saka [the present name] is a corrupt form of Sakahime.”
*6 This was perhaps the village in which the district office was located.
*7 The violent god may have been an old chieftain whose influence was ebbing.
See HAR, “Village of Ahaha,” under the “District of Kako”; “Oshi Kaha,” under
the “District of Ihibo”; “Village of Hagihara,” under the “District of Ihibo”; and
“Village of Woyake,” under the “District of Ihibo.” According to recent scholarship, agatanushi was a title given to local chieftains in the territories in which the
Yamato Court had established firm control. See Inoue Mitsusada, Nihon kodai
kokka no kenkyu (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1967), 320. The story indicates that
there was conflict between a former chieftain and a newly appointed magistrate.
The two Tsuchikumo women were probably sorceress-rulers.
28 The story is clearly a product of the Kofun period. It indicates that some kind
of an agreement was concluded on the boundary of the territories held by the old
and new rulers. See HAR, note 169.
22? The women were chieftains who ruled the place called Yamada. Apparently
these female leaders interceded with the new royal deputy, agatanushi, for the
chieftain who ruled on the upper reaches of the Saka River. The violent god of the
upper river represented the early settlers of the area.
260 The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki
There is a stone deity called Yotahime on the upper reaches of the
Saka Gaha. Every year the sea god {which is said to be a shark} goes
upriver to visit this goddess. Numerous small fish follow him. [During
this time, people are forbidden to eat the fish.] If one observes this
law [and abstains from eating fish], he will come to no harm. But if
one breaks this law [and catches and eats the fish], he will lose his
life. These fish remain [on the upper river] for a few days before returning to the sea.*°
District of Woki
The district of Woki has seven townships {twenty villages}, one postingstation, and one beacon.*!
In the remote past, the Tsuchikumo residing in this village secured
themselves in a small fortress and resisted the royal order. Therefore,
Prince Yamato Takeru launched a campaign and annihilated them
all. That is why the district was named Woki (small fortress).*
District of Matsura
The district of Matsura has eleven townships {twenty-six villages},
five posting-stations, and eight beacons.
En route to her attack upon Silla, Princess Okinaga Tarashi led her
forces through this district and stopped for a meal beside the Tamashima Brook. The princess made a fishhook out of a sewing needle
and used a piece of thread from her skirt as a fishing line. For bait she
used a few grains of cooked rice. Thereupon, she climbed onto a rock
in the river, held the fishing line in the air, and prayed, “I wish to
© A similar story occurs in the IZU. In that story, a shark fell in love with a
goddess who lived on the upper reaches of a river. Disliking the shark, the goddess
dammed the river so that the shark could not proceed. Note that in the HIZ the
story is combined with a tale of fish that migrate upstream for spawning (see IZU,
note 184; and Aoki, Izumo fudoki, 69-70).
*! None of the seven townships are described below. The posting-station is the
one listed in the Wamyosho as Taku (or Takaku) (p. 854). The beacon is thought
to have been located on one of the hills east of the present-day Taku City.

attack Silla and take possession of her treasure. May ayu be caught as
a good omen if my enterprise is to be victorious and if I am to return
home safely.”*
She threw the hook into the river. After a little while she caught
an ayu. “What a wonderful sign this is!” exclaimed the princess. That
is how the place came to be named Medzura (wonderful). In memory
of this auspicious catch by Princess Okinaga Tarashi, all the women
of the area fish during the fourth month. [It is said that,] even if they
try, men are unable to catch fish there.*®
Kagami no Watari. {It is north of the district office.} Long ago, during
the reign of Prince Takewo [posthumously known as Emperor Senkal],
who governed the realm from Ihorino Palace at Hinokuma, Sadehiko
of the Ohotomo family was sent to impose peace in Mimana and to
save the state of Paekche [on the Korean Peninsula]. While he was
on this royal mission, Sadehiko came to this village. There he courted
and married Otohi of the hamlet of Shinohara. {The graph reads
shino.} {This woman is one of the forebears of the Kusakabe no Kimi
family.} Otohi was one of the most beautiful women in the world.*
When he departed for [the Korean Peninsula], Sadehiko presented
a mirror to his wife Otohi. Sorrowfully, Otohi crossed Kuri Kaha with
tears in her eyes. When she came to the middle of the river, the
ribbon broke and the mirror sank to the bottom.’ This is why the ford
is called Kagami no Watari (mirror ford).
4 For Princess Okinaga Tarashi, see HAR, note 18; and Aoki, “Empress Jingu,”
3-36.
35 A nearly identical story in the NS gives an account of the same princess
(Nihongi, part 1, 227).
36 Sadehiko is known to have been the son of Ohotomo Kanamura (fl. c. 527),
a powerful supporter of Prince Tamaho (known as Emperor Keitai, r. 507-5312).
However, the story related here should not be taken as historical fact. The name
Otohi means “young daughter,” or “pretty maiden.” Although it is not a proper
name, for clarity I have treated it as such.
31 The handle of a typical mirror of this period is located in the center behind
the reflecting side. There was a hole in the handle to which a ribbon or tassel was
fastened. Such mirrors served magical rather than practical purposes, and in an
extended sense they symbolized political power as well. In this story, the mirror is a
symbol of Sadehiko’s spirit. See also HIT, note 80.
262 The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki
Hirefuri no Mine. {It is east of the district office. There is a beacon on
this hill.} When Sadehiko left for Mimana, Otohi climbed this hill
and waved her scarf to him. Thus, it was named Hirefuri no Mine
(scarf-waving hill).°*
Five days after her husband’s departure, Otohi received a visit
from a man who looked very much like her husband. He slept with
her each night but left her early each morning.” These nightly visits
aroused Otohi’s suspicions, and finally she could bear it no longer.
Secretly she prepared a piece of thread to attach to the fringe of his
tunic, so that when he left she could follow him. When she followed
the thread the next morning, Otohi came to the bank of a marsh at
the top of this hill. There she saw a serpent lying on the ground. Its
body was in the water and its snake-faced head was at the water’s
edge. When Otohi approached, the serpent changed into a man and
began to speak.
Shinohara no Lovely Otohi
Otohime no ko Of Shinohara!
Sa hitoyu mo Let us have
Ine temu shita ya A night together,
The ni kudasamu Before you return home.
[Alarmed,] Otohi’s servant rushed to tell her parents what had
happened; they organized the villagers to [protect] her. When the
party climbed the hill, neither the serpent nor the girl were to be
found. They searched the marsh and found human remains. Everyone
agreed that the remains were those of Otohi. They buried the remains
on the south side of this hill where the tomb is still in existence.
*8 The scarf-waving hill (Hirefuri no Mine) is 284 meters high. The MYS contains poems about this episode. The girl is known by the name of Sayohime. One
of the poems has a preface, the content of which is similar to that of the HIZ
legend. See The Manyoshu (New York: Columbia University Press, 1965), 261.
»® This sort of tale is very common in early Japanese folklore. It indicates a period
of transition from a matrilineal to a patrilineal society. See HIT, “Village of Ubaraki,”
under the “District of Naka.”
© The girl’s name in the poem appears to be Otohime. The scarf-waving hill
must have been a place from which the villagers could see off the men departing
for the Korean Peninsula. The Otohi-Sadehiko type of love story must have been
very common. i

Village of Kasu. {It is northwest of the district office.} Once upon a
time, a female Tsuchikumo chief named Mirukashi Hime lived in this
village. When Prince [Ohotarashi], who governed the realm from
Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, toured this area, he sent one of his men,
Ohoyatako {one of the forebears of the Kusakabe no Kimi family}, to
destroy her. When Ohoyatako arrived, it was so misty that he could
see nothing. Thus, the village was named Kasumi (mist). Now the
place is called Kasu, a corrupt form of Kasumi.*!
Posting-station of Afuka. {It is northwest of the district office.} Very
long ago, Princess Okinaga Tarashi wished to conduct an expeditionary
campaign against Silla [on the Korean Peninsula]. When she arrived
at this posting-station on her way to Silla, she saw a deer on the road.
That is why the posting-station was named Afuka (meeting deer).”
The sea lies east of the station. Abalone, spiral shellfish, snapper,
wakame, and miru are obtained there.
Posting-station of Tomo. {It is northwest of the district office.} In the past,
when she was on a military mission, Princess Okinaga Tarashi came to
this place and stayed. She then adopted a man’s attire. [At that time]
she happened to drop her archery arm pad [there]. The station therefore was named Tomo (archery arm pad). [This station is situated on
a small point of land jutting out into the sea.] Abalone, spiral shellfish, snapper, several other kinds of fish, wakame, and miru are obtained
in the sea that surrounds the posting-station on the east and west.“
“1 Note that both this Ohoyatako and the woman who became Sadehiko’s
consort are identified as forebears of the Kusakabe no Kimi. Thus, if Otohi was a
historical person, she must have given birth to a child or two before her meeting
with Sadehiko.
* For asimilar name, see HIT, “District of Kuji.”
8 Wakame is Undaria pinnatifida Suringar, and miru is Codium fragile Suringar.
Both are edible sea plants. The Japanese concept of sea plants is entirely different
from that of westerners. See Edwin Cranston, “Water-plant Imagery in the
Man’yoshu,” Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 31 (1971): 13ff44 That the princess was dressed like a man indicates that it was common for
women to arm themselves and engage in warfare like men. The tomo was worn on
the archer’s bow hand. When the bowstring struck it, it produced a loud sound.
The tomo was invented originally as a protective device. By the eighth century,
however, it had become an ornamental/ceremonial piece because of the sound it
produced (see Manyoshu, 81).
264 The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki
Ohoya Shima [Township of Ohoya]. {It is west of the district office.}
In ancient times, there was a Tsuchikumo named Ohomi (big body)
in this village. He would not submit to Prince [Ohotarashi], who
governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, even when
the prince journeyed to the area. The prince therefore decreed that
this man must be destroyed, and finally he annihilated Ohomi [and
his followers]. After that the ama (divers/seafarers) began to build
dwellings on the island. These houses are numerous, and the island
constitutes a township. The township is called Ohoya (numerous
households). There is a cavern on the south side of the island. Stalactic
formations and magnolia trees [may be seen at this spot]. Abalone,
spiral shellfish, snapper, several other kinds of fish, wakame, and miru
are obtained in the surrounding waters.”
Township of Chika. {It is [located on islands] in the sea southwest of
the district office. There are three beacons on these islands. }*°
When he stayed at the temporary palace on Shishiki Shima, the
same prince [Ohotarashi] saw islands in the sea to the west. Smoke
covered the islands. The prince ordered Momotari of the Azumi no
Muraji to go and inspect the area. Altogether Momotari found about
eighty islands, only two of which were inhabited. The one called
Wochika was inhabited by [a group of] Tsuchikumo led by Ohomimi
(big ears). On the other, Ohochika Shima, there lived a Tsuchikumo
chief named Jarimimi (hanging ears). The other islands were not
inhabited. Momotari captured Ohomimi and Tarimimi [and their followers] and took them to the prince as prisoners.*”
When Prince [Ohotarashi] was about to issue the order for their
execution, the Tsuchikumo prisoners begged for mercy. Ohomimi [performed] nomi, and said, “I know that I deserve death. Ten thousand
executions would not be enough [to compensate] for the crimes committed by [offenders like] me. [Yet I beg for your mercy, my lord.] If I
am pardoned and permitted to live, I will prepare tributary foods and
send them to your table [as long as I live].” *
* We can infer from the story that the newly arrived ruler(s) subjugated the
chieftain and befriended the seafarers of this area.
“* This township constituted what is now called the Goto Retto (Goto Islands).
*T For Azumi (Adzumi) no Muraji, see HAR, note 92.
“8 Here for the word nomi (prostrating), the graphs meaning “kowtowing” are

Ohomimi then took pieces of tree bark and with them made [models
of dried shellfish. There were] samples of naga ahabi, muchi ahabi,
kage ahabi, and hawari ahabi [all these are varieties of dried abalone].
Upon seeing them, the prince decided to pardon Ohomimi and the
other prisoners. His lordship said, “Although [they are] far away, those
islands seem closer now. They shall be called Chika Shima (nearby
islands).” That is why the islands are called Chika.
Betel-nut palm, magnolia, gardenia, itabi kadzura, tsudzura, medake,
small bamboo, paper mulberry, lotus lily, and hiyu grow on these islands.
Abalone, spiral shellfish, snapper, mackerel, several other kinds of
fish, wakame, miru, and other kinds of sea plants may be obtained
there.” The seafarers [fishermen] on these islands also raise livestock. There are a number of bovines and horses there.
[To the south lay two other groups of islands.] There are more than
a hundred islands in one group, and eighty in the other. There are
harbors on the two largest islands of the latter group. {One is Ahikoda
no Tomari where more than twenty ships can anchor. The other is
Kahara no Ura where more than ten ships can anchor.} Envoys to
T’ang [China] sail westward from these harbors and pass Mineraku
no Saki {the cape west of Kahara no Ura}. The facial features of
seafarers living on these islands resemble those of the hayahito. They
are highly skilled at shooting on horseback. They speak an entirely
different language from the other local residents [of Hizen Province].*!

occurring at that time. This area is known to have presented seafood to the Yamato
Court as tribute.

© There were royal pastures on these islands during the Heian period. Not only
these islands but all of Matsura District was known for its excellent pastures.
5! Hayato, or Hayahito, are traditionally considered to have been settlers on the
southern end of Kyushu. During the eighth century, some members of the Hayato
tribes were brought to the capital to perform ceremonial duties utilizing such
unusual talents as horseback riding and the imitation of bird and animal calls.
Ahikoda harbor was located on the west shore of the present-day Nakadori Shima.
There is a shrine at the site. Kahara harbor was located on the north shore of the
present-day Fukue Shima.
266 The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki
District of Kishima
The district of Kishima has four townships {thirteen villages}, and one
posting-station.”
When he was touring [the land of Hizen], Prince [Ohotarashi],
who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, anchored
his fleet at the village of Ihataki in this district. [Fresh] cold water
sprang from the mooring post of his lordship’s vessel. It is also said that
the spot where his ship anchored became an island. The prince observed
these unusual phenomena, and said, “This district shall be named
Kashi Shima (island of the mooring post).” The present name, Kishima,
is a corrupt form of Kashi Shima.”
There is a hot spring west of the district office. It is surrounded by
craggy cliffs and is very forbidding.*
Womina Yama. {These [hills] are northeast of the district office. }
When the same prince [Ohotarashi] travelled in this area, there
were several female Tsuchikumo wizards living atop the hills. They
would not submit to the royal order and resisted for some time. Thus,
the prince sent an army to destroy them. These hills are called Womina
Yama (female hills) because of the women who were living there.»
District of Fujitsu
The district of Fujitsu has four townships {nine villages}, one posting-station,*® and one beacon.
In the remote past, Prince Yamato Takeru came to this area. He
anchored at this ford because the sun was setting in the western hills
when he arrived at this location. Before setting off for the interior the

ancient Japan.
* This was the posting-station of Shihoda.
The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki 267
following morning, he moored his ship to a huge wisteria tree. That is
why the district is called Fujitsu (wisteria ford).%
Township of Nomi. {It is east of the district office.} When Prince
[Ohotarashi], who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, came to this area, there were three Tsuchikumo brothers living
in this village. {The eldest was Ohoshiro, the middle one was Nakashiro, and the youngest was Woshiro.} They secured themselves in a
fortress and would not submit to the prince. The prince sent Wakahiko,
the forebear of the Ki no Atahi, to punish them. Thereupon, the three
brothers came out and pleaded guilty. They kowtowed and begged
for their lives. Thus, the place was named Nomi (kowtow).*8
Township of Tara. {It is south of the district office and faces the sea. }
The same prince [Ohotarashi] toured this area. After inspecting the
state of affairs there, he said, “Although this land is narrow, food is
plentiful. It shall be called Tarashi (affluent).” The present name
Tara is a derivation of Tarashi.*?
Shihota Gaha. {It is north of the district office.} This river rises in the
Tara no Mine (Tara hills) in the southwestern part of this district and
flows east to empty into the sea. At high tide the water flows upstream
with a very strong current. That is why it was named Shiho Takamitsu
(coming tide high and full). Now it is called Shihota, which is a corrupt form of Shiho Takamitsu. There is a waterfall on the upper reaches
of this river. It plunges over a craggy precipice about twenty feet high.
Ayu are abundant there. There is a hot spring on the east bank of this
tiver. The water of this spring is effective in healing human diseases.©
5? Today there is a place called Fujitsu in Kashima-machi. According to the
local villagers, the site was once at the mouth of the Shihowi River. A large wisteria
tree grew on the south side. Persons who passed this place in boats would dedicate
wine to the tree and pray for good weather.
8 For nomi, see note 48, above.
9 This site is located on the east side of the Tara Dake. It is a series of narrow
strips of land.
6 This is the present-day Ureshino Spa, in which the temperature of the water
is about 95 degrees centigrade.
268 The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki
District of Sonoki
The district of Sonoki has four townships {seven villages}, two postingstations, and three beacons.*!
In the remote past, on his way back from his victorious campaign
against the Kumaso, Prince [Ohotarashi], who governed the realm
from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, stopped at a temporary palace on
Usa Beach in Toyo no Michi no Kuchi [Buzen]. He ordered Kamishiro
no Atahi, the lord-in-waiting, to arrest the Tsuchikumo in the village
of Hayaki in this district.”
While he was there, a woman named Hayakitsu Hime [came forward
and] informed Kamishiro that she had a brother who was a Tsuchikumo,
saying, “Sir, I have a brother named Taketsumima. He lives in the
village of Take and has in his possession beautiful jewels, called Itabi,
of the god Iso no Kami. He cherishes them so much that he keeps
them in a secret place and will not let others see them.”
Kamishiro went in search of this man, who fled to the other side of
the hill, seeking to hide in Ochi Ishi no Mine. {It is a hill north of the
district office.} Kamishiro, however, pursued Taketsumima and finally
caught him.
To Kamishiro’s inquiry as to the truthfulness [of his sister’s allegation], Taketsumima replied, “Yes, indeed. Actually I have two kinds
of jewels. One is called Itabi of the god Iso no Kami. The other is
called Shiratama. They are indeed rare stones to be cherished. Nonetheless, let me respectfully present them as my tribute.”® Takemitsuma
surrendered his jewels to Kamishiro and furthermore informed him of
another Tsuchikumo. “There is a man named Noyana in the village of
Kawagishi (riverbank). He also has beautiful jewels, which he cherishes

854). The locations of the beacons are not known.

Hayaki was located around the Hayaki Straits, which now belong to Sasebo City.

greatly. I do not suppose that he would ever surrender them to your
lordship.”°4
Kamishiro searched out and captured Noyana. Noyana answered
Kamishiro’s questions, saying, “Yes, sir. I do indeed possess such jewels,
and will present them as my tribute. I dare not begrudge you them.”
Kamishiro returned to the prince with these three varieties of booty.
The prince said, “This land shall be called Sonahitama (furnished
with jewels).” The present name Sonoki is a corrupt form of Sonahitama.
Township of Ukiana. {It is north of the district office.} The same prince
[Ohotarashi] said to Kamishiro, while staying at the temporary palace
at Usa Beach, “We have toured several territories and conquered the
Tsuchikumo in most of them. Are there any Tsuchikumo leaders who
have not submitted to our authority?” Kamishiro said, “The village
from which smoke is now rising has yet to come under your lordship’s
influence.”
Kamishiro was sent to that village, which was presided over by a
female Tsuchikumo named Ukianawa Hime. Because she was obstinate
and would not pay tribute, the prince destroyed her. The township
was named after this female chief, and was called Ukiana.®
Township of Suka. {It is southwest of the district office.} In the remote
past, when she passed through this area on her way to conduct an expeditionary campaign against Silla, Princess Okinaga Tarashi anchored
her boat in the sea northeast of this township. The mooring post was
transformed into a rock approximately twenty feet high and ten feet
in circumference. It was about ten cho [approximately 1,200 yards] offshore. The rock was high and craggy, and no trees or grass grew on it.
A high wind capsized and sank the boat carrying the lords-inwaiting. The Tsuchikumo chief named Utsuhi Omaro, who happened
to be there, rescued [the princess’s soldiers]. Because of this, the
*4 In early Japanese society, the ownership of jewels was crucial to the maintenance of leadership. They not only indicated the wealth of a chieftain but also
conferred magical power. Note, for example, that of the three objects of the Japanese
Imperial Regalia jewels are of central importance (see Aoki, “Empress Jingu,” 21).
6° The location of Ukiana is not known, although it must have been southeast
of the present-day Sasebo City.
270 The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki
township came to be called Sukuhi [meaning “rescuing”]. The present
name Suka is a corrupt form [of sukuhi].%
Straits of Hayaki. {They are northwest of the district office.} The
current is fast and strong in these straits. The sound of the approaching
waves is like a thunderstorm. That is why the place is called Hayaki
no To (rushing straits). Trees grow abundantly there. Their roots are
in the ground; their branches extend into the sea, [touching the water].
Wakame grows rapidly there and is one of the tributary goods [sent] to
the Court [from this area].®
District of Takaku
The district of Takaku has nine townships {twenty-one villages}, four
posting-stations, and five beacons.®
In the remote past, while staying at a temporary palace at Nagasu
Beach of Tamakina District in Higo, Prince [Ohotarashi], who governed
the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, viewed the hill of Takaku
District, and said, “That hill looks as if it could be an island. I wish to
know if it is a hill or if it is an island.” Thereupon, the prince ordered
Ohono no Sukune to inspect the area closely. [When Ohono no
Sukune] came to this district, he met a man who said to him, “I am
the god in this hill. My name is Takakutsukura (elevated seat). I
came to receive you because | heard that you were sent by the prince.”
That is how the district came to be named Takaku. [Takaku is a
shortened form of the name of the god, Takakutsukura.]°
Hyiha no Ike. {Natives call the cliff [by this pond] Hijiha. It is northwest of the district office.} There is a high cliff on the east side of this
pond facing the sea. It is approximately a thousand feet high and
° This area included present-day Nagasaki, facing Omura Bay.
°7 Wakame grows fast in this place due to the warm climate.
* The district of Takaku encompassed the present-day Takaki and Isahaya
areas. The Wamyosho lists the posting-stations of Funakoshi, Yamada, and Notori.
The fourth was probably Nihikita, which was south of present-day Shimabara City
(Wamyosho, 854; NKBT 2, 409, 17n).
® The name Ohono no Sukune is preceded by the word kami, which means
“god” or “venerable.”
The Hizen no Kuni Fudoki al
three thousand feet long. The waves of the western sea wash the cliff
at all times. Because the natives call [the cliff] Hijiha, the pond was
named Hijiha no Ike. This pond is about six thousand feet long and
five hundred feet wide. Its bank is twenty feet high. The pond covers
approximately five square miles. At high tide, sea water rushes over
the bank and flows into the pond. Lotus lily and water chestnut grow
abundantly. The lotus roots are delicious in the seventh and eighth
months. However, in the ninth month they lose their flavor entirely
and become tasteless and unappetizing.”
Mine no Yu. {It is south of the district office.} The source of this spa is
in a hill southwest of Takaku no Mine. An extremely large quantity of
hot water flows east from that hill. The spring water runs in abundance
and it is the hottest of all. It can be used for bathing only when mixed
with cold water. The taste of the water is sour. Sulphur and chalk are
obtained [in this area]. Hikimatsu pines grow there. Their needles are
thin. These pine trees bear a small berrylike fruit, which is the size of
adzuki and is edible.”
The site of the Hijiha no Ike is now a rice field.
| Mine no Yu is the present-day Unzen Spa.
