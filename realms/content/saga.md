The Realm of Saga is a realm in Japan.

## The Hizen Fudoki

The province has eleven districts containing seventy townships and 187 villages, eighteen posting-stations, twenty beacons, one fortress, and two temples where priests reside.

Formerly, Hizen and Higo provinces constituted one administrative unit called Hi no Kuni. In the remote past, during the reign of Prince Mimaki, who governed the realm from Midzukaki Palace at Shiki, there were two Tsuchikumo leaders named Uchisaru and Unasaru living in Asakuna Mountain of the district of Mashiki in Higo. These men and their numerous followers disobeyed princely commands and refused to submit to his lordship. The Court therefore issued an edict and sent a man named Take Wokumi to annihilate them. Take Wokumi is the forebear of the Hi no Kimi family.

Upon receiving this royal command, Take Wokumi conducted a campaign and destroyed all of the foes. Afterward he made an inspection tour of the conquered area. The sun was setting when he arrived at Shirakami Yama in the district of Yatsushiro, and so he spent the night there. During the night he saw a fire in the sky. After a while, the fire descended to the top of the mountain on which he stood. Take Wokumi was awed by the sight, and he hastily journeyed to the royal court to make a report. He said, "At the august command of your lordship, I carried out an expeditionary campaign against the recalcitrants in the distant west. Before the fighting ensued, however, the defiant enemies perished. What could have caused this except your lordship's majestic power?" He also described the way the fire had burned on top of the mountain.

The prince said, "We have never heard anything like what you are telling us now. I will name the place Hi no Kuni, the land of fire, since the fire descended there from the sky." The prince rewarded Take Wokumi's bravery by bestowing on him the kabane of Hi no Kimi, and he made him governor of that land. Thus, the land was named Hi no Kuni. Sometime later the land was divided in half, creating two provinces: Michi no Kuchi, the front half of Hi no Kuni, which became Hizen, and Michi no Shiri, the rear half, which became Higo.

At another time, Prince Ohotarashi, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace in Makimuku, punished the Kumaso, the independent native chieftains of central and southern Kyushu, and toured the land of Tsukushi. He embarked for Hi no Kuni at Hinagare no Ura of Ashikita. While he was crossing the sea, the sun set and night fell. It was so dark that the pilot could not navigate the ship. Thereupon the prince caught a glimpse of light in the sky. The prince commanded the pilot, saying, "Proceed in the direction of the light." The pilot obeyed the princely command and managed to reach the shore safely.

"What is that land called, where the fire burns? Who is tending that fire?" asked the prince. The people of the area answered, "That is the direction of Hi no Mura, the fire village, of the district of Yatsushiro in Hi no Kuni. But we do not know who is tending the fire." The prince said to his mahetsu kimi, his advisors, "That is no ordinary fire. It must not have been set by man. Now I know why this land is called Hi no Kuni, the land of divine fire."

## District of Ki

The district of Ki has six townships containing seventeen villages, one posting-station, and one fortress.

On an inspection tour to Tsukushi, Prince Ohotarashi, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, stayed at the temporary palace of Kaura in the district of Miwi. When he gazed toward Ki no Yama, he saw that mist covered the mountain. The prince said, "That land should be named Kiri, meaning mist." Later people changed it to Ki, which is now the name of the district.

Shrine of the God of Nagawoka. The shrine is east of the district office. The same prince came upon the place called Sakadono no Izumi on his return from his temporary palace at Kaura. When his meal was served, his armor took on an unusual brightness. The prince asked Uwesaka of the Urabe family to divine the meaning of this phenomenon. Uwesaka said, "There is a god in the land, and he desires to possess your lordship's armor."

"If that is the case, I will dedicate my armor at the shrine of that god," said the prince. "The armor shall become an eternal treasure of this shrine." The shrine thus was named Nagayo, meaning eternity. Later people changed its name to Nagawoka. Today only the helmet and fragments of the armor remain there.

Sakadono Spring. The spring is east of the district office. In the beginning of the ninth month, the water of this spring becomes cloudy and tastes sour. Its smell prevents one from drinking it. The water becomes normal again during the first month, and only then do people drink it. The spring came to be called Sakawi no Izumi, after the sour taste of the water, which was also used to brew rice wine. Later, people changed the name to Sakadono no Izumi, the brewery spring.

Township of Himekoso. There is a river in this township called Yamaji Gaha. Its source is in the hills north of this district, and from there it flows south to meet the Great River of Miwi. In the remote past, an evil deity resided on the west bank of this river. Many travellers were killed by the deity. About half of the travellers who passed this way survived but the other half perished. In order to learn the cause of this curse, divination was employed. The answer came, "Find a man named Kazeko, a resident of Munakata District in Tsukushi no Michi no Kuchi, and let him serve at my shrine. If my wish is thus fulfilled, my violent spirit will be calmed." Kazeko was sent for and made priest of this deity's shrine.

Kazeko dedicated a hata, a banner, and prayed, "If this deity sincerely desires my service, may this banner fly in the wind and drop at his feet." With this, the priest raised the banner high and let it fly in the wind. The cloth flew as far as the grove of Himekoso, in the district of Mihara, where it landed. The banner then flew back from the grove and landed near Yamaji Gaha, and by studying the course the banner had travelled, Kazeko determined the god's dwelling place.

That night Kazeko had a dream in which a kutsubiki, a Korean-style weaving tool, and a tatari, a Korean-style spinning wheel, appeared to be dancing and pushing him around. The dream told him that the deity was female. Thereupon, he built a shrine to the goddess. Since then the deity has been appeased, and travellers are no longer killed. Thus, the place came to be called Himekoso, the shrine of the princess. Himekoso is now the name of this township.

## District of Yabu

The district of Yabu has four townships containing twelve villages and one beacon. In the past, Prince Ohotarashi, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, came upon this area while on a hunting trip. A hunting dog belonging to one of the royal huntsmen rushed in, barking at the place where the peasants of this district had gathered to receive the prince. Among the crowd of villagers was a pregnant woman. When this woman stared at the dog, it stopped barking, for in ancient Japan dogs symbolized easy childbirth. Thus, the place was named Inu no Koye Yamu, meaning the dog's barking ceased. The present name of the district, Yabu, is a corrupt form of Yamu.

Township of Tosu. During the reign of Prince Homuda, who governed the realm from the Shining Palace at Karu Shima, the people of this district built an aviary where they raised many kinds of birds. The birds were presented to the Court. That is why the district was named Toya, meaning birdhouses. People later changed the name to Tosu, meaning birds' nests.

Township of Watari. In the remote past, the ford of the Miwi River was so broad that both men and cattle had difficulty crossing. When Prince Ohotarashi, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, came to this place on a hunting trip, he established a boatyard on Ikuha Yama and a rudder factory on Kaura Yama. A boat was built, which made it possible for people and animals to cross the ford. That is why the township was named Watari, meaning ferry crossing.

Township of Sayama. The same prince came to this area and stayed at his temporary palace on the hill of this township. When he walked around the palace grounds to see the view in all directions, the visibility was extremely good. Thus, the place was named Sayake, meaning clearly visible. The present name of this township, Sayama, is a corrupt form of Sayake.

## District of Mine

The district of Mine has six townships containing seventeen villages and one posting-station.

In the past, this district formed a single jurisdiction together with the territory of the present-day district of Kamusaki. Later, Tori of the Ama no Atahi petitioned the prince to divide it into two districts, Kamusaki and Mine. The district of Mine was named after the village of Mine in the district of Kamusaki.

Township of Mononobe. There is a shrine to the war god Futsunushi, the guardian god of the Mononobe family. In the past, Princess Kashikiya, who governed the realm from Woharida Palace, made Prince Kume general of the expeditionary forces moving against the kingdom of Silla. At her majesty's command, the prince came to Tsukushi and had the Wakamiyabe people of the Mononobe family build in this village a shrine for the god Futsunushi. Thus, the township was named Mononobe.

Township of Ayabe. In the remote past, Prince Kume came to this place en route to his campaign against Silla. He brought with him Ayahito, continental immigrants descended from prisoners of war taken from Silla, from the camp of Oshinumi in Yamato. The prince let these men make weapons. That is how the township came to be called Ayabe, meaning the immigrant workers' group.

Township of Meta. There is a well in this township, the water of which tastes salty. Seaweed grows at the bottom of the well. In the remote past, when he went there on a hunting trip, Prince Ohotarashi noticed the seaweed and called the well Menaruwi, meaning the seaweed-growing well. Today, people call the well Metawi, a corrupt form of Menaruwi. Meta also became the name of this township.

## District of Kamusaki

The district of Kamusaki has nine townships containing twenty-six villages, one posting-station, one beacon, and one temple where a priest resides.

In the remote past, a violent god lived in this district. This god used to kill many travellers who passed through the area. After Prince Ohotarashi, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, toured this area, the deity was appeased, and it has done no harm since. Thus, the district is called Kamusaki.

Township of Mine. There is a river in this district. Its source is in a hill in the northern part of the district. It flows south and empties into the sea. Ayu, the prized freshwater fish, are obtained there. When he toured this area, the same prince sailed upstream from the mouth of the river and stopped at this village overnight. On the following morning the prince said, "I had a peaceful sleep last night. This village should be called Mineyasu, meaning august sleep in peace." It was then named Mine, meaning august sleep.

Township of Funaho. When the same prince came to this area, all the people of the township got into boats and sailed to the ford of Mine Gaha where they received him. That is why the township was named Funaho, meaning boat sails. Four rocks at this ford are said to be the anchors of royal boats. One of the rocks is six feet high and five feet in diameter. Another is eight feet high and five feet in diameter. If a barren woman prayed to these two rocks, she would conceive and bear a child without fail. One of the remaining two rocks is four feet high and five feet in diameter. The other is three feet high and four feet in diameter. In times of drought, people pray to the latter two rocks, and it is said that the prayers will bring rain without fail.

Township of Kamata. The same prince also stayed the night in this township. When his meal was served, flies buzzed about noisily. The prince complained, "The flies are buzzing so noisily." Thus, the township was named Kama, meaning noisy. The present name, Kamata, was derived from Kama.

Kotoki Woka. This area, south of the district office, was once a flat field. There were no hills anywhere nearby. Prince Ohotarashi commented on this, saying, "There should be a hill in such a place as this." He then ordered his men to construct a mound at the site. When it was finished, the prince climbed to the top of the knoll for a banquet. After enjoying the banquet, Prince Ohotarashi propped up his koto, one of the magical instruments used by shamans. Thereupon, the zither turned into a camphor tree, now fifty feet high and thirty feet in girth. That is why the place is called Kotoki Woka, the zither-tree hill.

Township of Miyako. The same prince built his temporary palace there. Thus, the township is called Miyako, meaning palace site.

## District of Saka

The district of Saka has six townships containing nineteen villages, one posting-station, and one temple.

In the remote past, there was a camphor tree growing in this district. It was tall and had abundant leaves. In the morning its shadow covered Kamakaha Yama in the district of Kishima; in the evening its shadow covered Kusayoko Yama in the district of Yabu. When he came to this place, Prince Yamato Takeru admired the flourishing camphor tree, and said, "This land must be named Saka," using a graph meaning "flourishing." That is why the district was named Saka. The graph was later altered, and now it is written in two graphs of uncertain meaning.

There is another theory about the name Saka. West of the district office is the river known as Saka Gaha. Its sources are the hills in the northern part of this district, and from there it flows south to the sea. Ayu are obtained from this river. According to this theory, once upon a time a violent god who harassed passersby resided in the upper part of this river. The god killed half of the passersby and spared half. Under these circumstances, Ohoarata, the forebear of the agatanushi, the local magistrate of this area, asked two Tsuchikumo women named Ohoyamadame and Sayamadame to divine the cause of the god's violence.

After seeking the reason for the god's curse, the women reported to Ohoarata, saying, "If you take clay obtained in the village of Shimoda and make figurines of men and horses, and then dedicate them to this deity, it will be appeased." Following the women's advice, Ohoarata dedicated the figurines to this god. The violent god accepted his offering and was appeased.

"Wise are these women," proclaimed Ohoarata. "I will now call this land Sakahime, meaning wise women." The district thus was named Sakahime. Saka, the present name, is a corrupt form of Sakahime.

There is a stone deity called Yotahime on the upper reaches of the Saka Gaha. Every year the sea god, said to be a shark, goes upriver to visit this goddess. Numerous small fish follow him. During this time, people are forbidden to eat the fish. If one observes this law and abstains from eating fish, he will come to no harm. But if one breaks this law and catches and eats the fish, he will lose his life. These fish remain on the upper river for a few days before returning to the sea.

## District of Woki

The district of Woki has seven townships containing twenty villages, one posting-station, and one beacon.

In the remote past, the Tsuchikumo residing in this village secured themselves in a woki, a small stockade surrounded by mud walls and rocks, and resisted the royal order. Therefore, Prince Yamato Takeru launched a campaign and annihilated them all. That is why the district was named Woki, meaning small fortress.

## District of Matsura

The district of Matsura has eleven townships containing twenty-six villages, five posting-stations, and eight beacons.

En route to her attack upon the kingdom of Silla, Princess Okinaga Tarashi led her forces through this district and stopped for a meal beside the Tamashima Brook. The princess made a fishhook out of a sewing needle and used a piece of thread from her skirt as a fishing line. For bait she used a few grains of cooked rice. Thereupon, she climbed onto a rock in the river, held the fishing line in the air, and prayed, "I wish to attack Silla and take possession of her treasure. May ayu be caught as a good omen if my enterprise is to be victorious and if I am to return home safely."

She threw the hook into the river. After a little while she caught an ayu. "What a wonderful sign this is!" exclaimed the princess. That is how the place came to be named Medzura, meaning wonderful. In memory of this auspicious catch by Princess Okinaga Tarashi, all the women of the area fish during the fourth month. It is said that, even if they try, men are unable to catch fish there.

Kagami no Watari. Long ago, during the reign of Prince Takewo, who governed the realm from Ihorino Palace at Hinokuma, Sadehiko of the Ohotomo family was sent to impose peace in Mimana and to save the state of Paekche on the Korean Peninsula. While he was on this royal mission, Sadehiko came to this village. There he courted and married Otohi of the hamlet of Shinohara, one of the most beautiful women in the world.

When he departed for the Korean Peninsula, Sadehiko presented a mirror to his wife Otohi. In those days, mirrors served magical rather than practical purposes, and symbolized the spirit and political power of their owner. Sorrowfully, Otohi crossed Kuri Kaha with tears in her eyes. When she came to the middle of the river, the ribbon fastening the mirror to its handle broke and the mirror sank to the bottom. This is why the ford is called Kagami no Watari, the mirror ford.

Hirefuri no Mine. When Sadehiko left for Mimana, Otohi climbed this hill and waved her scarf to him. Thus, it was named Hirefuri no Mine, the scarf-waving hill.

Five days after her husband's departure, Otohi received a visit from a man who looked very much like her husband. He slept with her each night but left her early each morning. These nightly visits aroused Otohi's suspicions, and finally she could bear it no longer. Secretly she prepared a piece of thread to attach to the fringe of his tunic, so that when he left she could follow him. When she followed the thread the next morning, Otohi came to the bank of a marsh at the top of the hill. There she saw a serpent lying on the ground. Its body was in the water and its snake-faced head was at the water's edge. When Otohi approached, the serpent changed into a man and began to speak:

Lovely Otohi
Of Shinohara!
Let us have
A night together,
Before you return home.

Alarmed, Otohi's servant rushed to tell her parents what had happened, and they organized the villagers to protect her. When the party climbed the hill, neither the serpent nor the girl were to be found. They searched the marsh and found human remains. Everyone agreed that the remains were those of Otohi. They buried the remains on the south side of the hill where the tomb is still in existence.

Village of Kasu. Once upon a time, a female Tsuchikumo chief named Mirukashi Hime lived in this village. When Prince Ohotarashi, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, toured this area, he sent one of his men, Ohoyatako, to destroy her. When Ohoyatako arrived, it was so misty that he could see nothing. Thus, the village was named Kasumi, meaning mist. Now the place is called Kasu, a corrupt form of Kasumi.

Posting-station of Afuka. Very long ago, Princess Okinaga Tarashi wished to conduct an expeditionary campaign against Silla on the Korean Peninsula. When she arrived at this posting-station on her way, she saw a deer on the road. That is why the posting-station was named Afuka, meaning meeting deer. The sea lies east of the station. Abalone, spiral shellfish, snapper, wakame, and miru are obtained there.

Posting-station of Tomo. In the past, when she was on a military mission, Princess Okinaga Tarashi came to this place and stayed. She then adopted a man's attire. At that time she happened to drop her tomo, an archery arm pad worn on the bow hand that produced a loud sound when struck by the bowstring. The station therefore was named Tomo. Abalone, spiral shellfish, snapper, several other kinds of fish, wakame, and miru are obtained in the sea that surrounds the posting-station on the east and west.

Ohoya Shima. In ancient times, there was a Tsuchikumo named Ohomi, meaning big body, in this village. He would not submit to Prince Ohotarashi, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, even when the prince journeyed to the area. The prince therefore decreed that this man must be destroyed, and finally he annihilated Ohomi and his followers. After that the ama, the divers and seafarers, began to build dwellings on the island. These houses are numerous, and the island constitutes a township. The township is called Ohoya, meaning numerous households. There is a cavern on the south side of the island. Stalactite formations and magnolia trees may be seen at this spot. Abalone, spiral shellfish, snapper, several other kinds of fish, wakame, and miru are obtained in the surrounding waters.

Township of Chika. When he stayed at the temporary palace on Shishiki Shima, the same prince saw islands in the sea to the west. Smoke covered the islands. The prince ordered Momotari of the Azumi no Muraji to go and inspect the area. Altogether Momotari found about eighty islands, only two of which were inhabited. The one called Wochika was inhabited by a group of Tsuchikumo led by Ohomimi, meaning big ears. On the other, Ohochika Shima, there lived a Tsuchikumo chief named Tarimimi, meaning hanging ears. The other islands were not inhabited. Momotari captured Ohomimi and Tarimimi and their followers and took them to the prince as prisoners.

When Prince Ohotarashi was about to issue the order for their execution, the Tsuchikumo prisoners begged for mercy. Ohomimi prostrated himself and said, "I know that I deserve death. Ten thousand executions would not be enough to compensate for the crimes committed by offenders like me. Yet I beg for your mercy, my lord. If I am pardoned and permitted to live, I will prepare tributary foods and send them to your table as long as I live."

Ohomimi then took pieces of tree bark and with them made models of dried shellfish. There were samples of naga ahabi, muchi ahabi, kage ahabi, and hawari ahabi, all varieties of dried abalone. Upon seeing them, the prince decided to pardon Ohomimi and the other prisoners. His lordship said, "Although they are far away, those islands seem closer now. They shall be called Chika Shima, meaning nearby islands." That is why the islands are called Chika.

Betel-nut palm, magnolia, gardenia, itabi kadzura, tsudzura, medake bamboo, paper mulberry, lotus lily, and hiyu grow on these islands. Abalone, spiral shellfish, snapper, mackerel, several other kinds of fish, wakame, miru, and other kinds of sea plants may be obtained there. The seafarers on these islands also raise livestock, and there are a number of bovines and horses.

To the south lay two other groups of islands. There are more than a hundred islands in one group, and eighty in the other. There are harbors on the two largest islands of the latter group. One is Ahikoda no Tomari, where more than twenty ships can anchor. The other is Kahara no Ura, where more than ten ships can anchor. Envoys to T'ang China sail westward from these harbors and pass Mineraku no Saki, the cape west of Kahara no Ura. The facial features of the seafarers living on these islands resemble those of the Hayahito, settlers from southern Kyushu known for their unusual talents such as horseback riding and the imitation of bird and animal calls. They are highly skilled at shooting on horseback. They speak an entirely different language from the other local residents of Hizen Province.

## District of Kishima

The district of Kishima has four townships containing thirteen villages and one posting-station.

When he was touring the land of Hizen, Prince Ohotarashi, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, anchored his fleet at the village of Ihataki in this district. Fresh cold water sprang from the mooring post of his lordship's vessel. It is also said that the spot where his ship anchored became an island. The prince observed these unusual phenomena, and said, "This district shall be named Kashi Shima, meaning island of the mooring post." The present name, Kishima, is a corrupt form of Kashi Shima.

There is a hot spring west of the district office. It is surrounded by craggy cliffs and is very forbidding.

Womina Yama. When the same prince travelled in this area, there were several female Tsuchikumo wizards living atop the hills. They would not submit to the royal order and resisted for some time. Thus, the prince sent an army to destroy them. These hills are called Womina Yama, the female hills, because of the women who were living there.

## District of Fujitsu

The district of Fujitsu has four townships containing nine villages, one posting-station, and one beacon.

In the remote past, Prince Yamato Takeru came to this area. He anchored at this ford because the sun was setting in the western hills when he arrived. Before setting off for the interior the following morning, he moored his ship to a huge wisteria tree. That is why the district is called Fujitsu, meaning wisteria ford.

Township of Nomi. When Prince Ohotarashi, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, came to this area, there were three Tsuchikumo brothers living in this village. The eldest was Ohoshiro, the middle one was Nakashiro, and the youngest was Woshiro. They secured themselves in a fortress and would not submit to the prince. The prince sent Wakahiko, the forebear of the Ki no Atahi, to punish them. Thereupon, the three brothers came out and pleaded guilty. They kowtowed and begged for their lives. Thus, the place was named Nomi, meaning kowtow.

Township of Tara. The same prince toured this area. After inspecting the state of affairs there, he said, "Although this land is narrow, food is plentiful. It shall be called Tarashi, meaning affluent." The present name Tara is a derivation of Tarashi.

Shihota Gaha. This river rises in the Tara no Mine in the southwestern part of the district and flows east to empty into the sea. At high tide the water flows upstream with a very strong current. That is why it was named Shiho Takamitsu, meaning coming tide high and full. Now it is called Shihota, a corrupt form of Shiho Takamitsu. There is a waterfall on the upper reaches of this river. It plunges over a craggy precipice about twenty feet high. Ayu are abundant there. There is a hot spring on the east bank of this river. The water of this spring is effective in healing human diseases.

## District of Sonoki

The district of Sonoki has four townships containing seven villages, two posting-stations, and three beacons.

In the remote past, on his way back from his victorious campaign against the Kumaso, Prince Ohotarashi, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, stopped at a temporary palace on Usa Beach in Toyo no Michi no Kuchi. He ordered Kamishiro no Atahi, the lord-in-waiting, to arrest the Tsuchikumo in the village of Hayaki in this district.

While he was there, a woman named Hayakitsu Hime came forward and informed Kamishiro that she had a brother who was a Tsuchikumo, saying, "Sir, I have a brother named Taketsumima. He lives in the village of Take and has in his possession beautiful jewels, called Itabi, of the god Iso no Kami. He cherishes them so much that he keeps them in a secret place and will not let others see them."

Kamishiro went in search of this man, who fled to the other side of the hill, seeking to hide in Ochi Ishi no Mine. Kamishiro, however, pursued Taketsumima and finally caught him.

To Kamishiro's inquiry as to the truthfulness of his sister's allegation, Taketsumima replied, "Yes, indeed. Actually I have two kinds of jewels. One is called Itabi of the god Iso no Kami. The other is called Shiratama. They are indeed rare stones to be cherished. Nonetheless, let me respectfully present them as my tribute." Taketsumima surrendered his jewels to Kamishiro and furthermore informed him of another Tsuchikumo. "There is a man named Noyana in the village of Kawagishi, on the riverbank. He also has beautiful jewels, which he cherishes greatly. I do not suppose that he would ever surrender them to your lordship."

Kamishiro searched out and captured Noyana. Noyana answered Kamishiro's questions, saying, "Yes, sir. I do indeed possess such jewels, and will present them as my tribute. I dare not begrudge you them." Kamishiro returned to the prince with these three varieties of booty. The prince said, "This land shall be called Sonahitama, meaning furnished with jewels." The present name Sonoki is a corrupt form of Sonahitama.

Township of Ukiana. The same prince said to Kamishiro, while staying at the temporary palace at Usa Beach, "We have toured several territories and conquered the Tsuchikumo in most of them. Are there any Tsuchikumo leaders who have not submitted to our authority?" Kamishiro said, "The village from which smoke is now rising has yet to come under your lordship's influence."

Kamishiro was sent to that village, which was presided over by a female Tsuchikumo named Ukianawa Hime. Because she was obstinate and would not pay tribute, the prince destroyed her. The township was named after this female chief, and was called Ukiana.

Township of Suka. In the remote past, when she passed through this area on her way to conduct an expeditionary campaign against Silla, Princess Okinaga Tarashi anchored her boat in the sea northeast of this township. The mooring post was transformed into a rock approximately twenty feet high and ten feet in circumference, about ten cho offshore. The rock was high and craggy, and no trees or grass grew on it.

A high wind capsized and sank the boat carrying the lords-in-waiting. The Tsuchikumo chief named Utsuhi Omaro, who happened to be there, rescued the princess's soldiers. Because of this, the township came to be called Sukuhi, meaning rescuing. The present name Suka is a corrupt form of Sukuhi.

Straits of Hayaki. The current is fast and strong in these straits. The sound of the approaching waves is like a thunderstorm. That is why the place is called Hayaki no To, meaning rushing straits. Trees grow abundantly there. Their roots are in the ground and their branches extend into the sea, touching the water. Wakame grows rapidly there and is one of the tributary goods sent to the Court from this area.

## District of Takaku

The district of Takaku has nine townships containing twenty-one villages, four posting-stations, and five beacons.

In the remote past, while staying at a temporary palace at Nagasu Beach of Tamakina District in Higo, Prince Ohotarashi, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, viewed the hill of Takaku District, and said, "That hill looks as if it could be an island. I wish to know if it is a hill or if it is an island." Thereupon, the prince ordered Ohono no Sukune to inspect the area closely. When Ohono no Sukune came to this district, he met a man who said to him, "I am the god in this hill. My name is Takakutsukura, meaning elevated seat. I came to receive you because I heard that you were sent by the prince." That is how the district came to be named Takaku, a shortened form of the name of the god.

Hijiha no Ike. There is a high cliff on the east side of this pond facing the sea. It is approximately a thousand feet high and three thousand feet long. The waves of the western sea wash the cliff at all times. Because the natives call the cliff Hijiha, the pond was named Hijiha no Ike. This pond is about six thousand feet long and five hundred feet wide. Its bank is twenty feet high. The pond covers approximately five square miles. At high tide, sea water rushes over the bank and flows into the pond. Lotus lily and water chestnut grow abundantly. The lotus roots are delicious in the seventh and eighth months. However, in the ninth month they lose their flavor entirely and become tasteless and unappetizing.

Mine no Yu. The source of this spa is in a hill southwest of Takaku no Mine. An extremely large quantity of hot water flows east from that hill. The spring water runs in abundance and it is the hottest of all. It can be used for bathing only when mixed with cold water. The taste of the water is sour. Sulphur and chalk are obtained in this area. Hikimatsu pines grow there, with thin needles. These pine trees bear a small berrylike fruit, the size of adzuki beans, which is edible.

Old provinces: Hizen.
