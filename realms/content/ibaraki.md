The Realm of Ibaraki is a realm in Japan.

Old provinces: Hitachi.


The Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki
he governor of Hitachi Province reports [to the Council of State]
about matters of the past handed down by the elders.! Upon my
inquiry into such matters as old tales and traditions, the elders replied
[as described below].
In ancient times, all the land east of Mount Ashigara in presentday Sagamu Province was referred to by the name Azuma (east). A
part of this territory, which is now Hitachi Province, then consisted of
[six] smaller areas. These were known as Nihihari (newly reclaimed),
Tsukuha (sticking to leaves), Ubaraki (thorn fortress), Naka (middle),
Kuji (whale), and Taka (highland). [During the pre-Taika period,
the Yamato Court] appointed a magistrate to administer each of these
six areas. These officials were from the families of wake (royal descendants) and miyatsuko (deputies/local chieftains).’
[After the Taika Reform,] during the reign of the emperor [posthumously known as Emperor Kotoku] who governed the realm from
Toyosaki Palace at Nagara in Naniha, [the Court] appointed Takamuku

no Kuni no Tsukasa.”
? Smaller areas: Moromoro no agata in the original. The graph that stands for the
term agata indicates that these areas belonged to the royal family before the Taika
Reform (see glossary, under agata). Wake: Ueda Masaaki interprets this term to
mean “royal descendants,” while Saeki Arikiyo takes it as a kabane (title/surname)
given to the pre-Taika chieftains. Both arguments hold true, in part, because it is
highly probable that the Yamato ruler and local chieftains assumed a kind of
pseudo-kinship through covenant. See Ueda Masaaki, Nihon kodai kokka ronkyu
(Tokyo: Hanawa Shobo, 1968), 67—68; and Saeki Arikiyo, Nihon kodai no seiji to
shakai (Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kobunkan, 1970), 32.

Hitachi Province in the Eighth Century
The Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki OI
no Omi as governor general of Azuma and Nakatomi Hataorita no
Muraji as deputy governor general.? At that time Azuma was divided
into eight provinces, one of which was Hitachi Province.
Hitachi Province is said by some to have been named for the lack
of natural barriers within its borders. Its land flows continuously and
the roadways are uninterrupted by wide waterways. The districts and
communities are separated only by such natural boundaries as dells
and rivers. Therefore, the province was named Hitachi (continuous
land).*
According to another story related by the elders, the name Hitachi
derives from a royal prince’s tour of the area. While travelling in the
Nihihari area on an inspection tour of the Azuma barbarian land,
Prince Yamato Takeru (Yamato the Brave) ordered Hinarasu, the kuni
no miyatsuko of this area, to dig a new well.’
The fresh water collected in the well was clear and prized for
drinking. The prince felt that such delightful water deserved the
princely blessing, so he stopped his palanquin. As he ladled out some
water with his hand the sleeve of his garment got wet. From this
occurrence [incident] the place acquired the name Hitachi (soaking
in water). This episode gave rise to the following folk song:
Tsukuha no Yama ni Dark cloud
Kurokumo kakari Hanging round Mount Tsukuha
3 Emperor Kotoku reigned from 645 to 654. “Appointed . . . governor general.”
This is my liberal translation of the expression sube osame shimeki, which basically
means that the Court allowed these two men to govern the area (see glossary,
under sube osa). Takamuku no Omi: This man is also called mahetsukimi. While
omi denotes his title, mahetsukimi indicates his function as a councillor at the
Yamato Court.
4 Continuous land: Commentators differ in their readings of this part of the text.
Ihave followed Akimoto’s interpretation.
5 Prince Yamato Takeru: Yamato Takeru (or Take) no Sumera Mikoto. For
more information about the term sumera mikoto, see Aoki, Ancient Myths, 136-37.
Nihihari (present-day reading Niibari) area: The word means “newly reclaimed.”
Hinarasu: A pre-Taika kuni no miyatsuko. He is said to have descended from
Ame no Hohi, the tutelary deity of the Izumo no Omi family. See Aoki, Izumo
fudoki, 60-61.

Hitachi is a spacious province with far-flung boundaries. Its soil is
fertile, awaiting farming. Blessed with resources from both sea and
highlands, its residents are self-sufficient and the households affluent.
If people labor at tilling and spinning, they soon prosper and avoid
poverty. If they want the taste of salt or fish, the sea is [at hand] on
their right, [as] mountains stand on their left; if they want to plant
mulberries or hemp, the terrain is ample to their rear and fore. The
whole province is a virtual storehouse of products. It is, indeed, the
land of prosperity. What ancient people called “Tokoyo” (eternal
world) must have been something like Hitachi.’
The only drawback is that the soil does not drain well. Because of
this, the soil throughout the province is considered to be of middle rather
than superior grade. During a prolonged rainy season, seedlings cannot grow. However, when the summer is dry, crops are generally good.
[This section is {copied} from the original draft {without omission.}]§
District of Nihihari
East of this district are high mountain ranges, which constitute the
boundary between it and the district of Naka. To the south is the district
of Shirakabe; the Keno Gaha (Keno river) flows along the west side.
° There are plays on words here. The first two syllables of the word hitasu (to
soak) are the same as the first two syllables of the name Hitachi. The expression
Tsukuha no Yama later came to be shortened to Tsukuhane (and Tsukubane). By
the same process of sound change, koromo no sode became koromode. Both
Tsukubane and koromode became indispensable terms in classical Japanese poetry.
’ Awaiting farming: As the original text has no punctuation, this translation
follows the punctuation suggested by Akimoto. Tokoyo: The author here attempts
a play on words. The first graph of the word tokoyo is the same as the first graph of
the proper noun Hitachi. See glossary, under Hitachi and Tokoyo.

The Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki 39
On the north lie the hills called Hata no Woka, which mark the boundary
between Shimotsu Keno and Hitachi provinces.?
According to the elders, during the reign of Prince Mimaki [posthumously known as Emperor Sujin], Hinarasu, the forebear of the
kuni no miyatsuko of Nihihari, was sent to pacify the violent barbarians
of Azuma. {Local people refer to them as araburu nishimono.} Upon
reaching the district of Nihihari, Hinarasu dug a well. {The well is
still in existence in the village of Nihihari. The well site provides the
neighboring residents with a festival ground from time to time.} The
water collected from this well was unusually clear. Thus, this district
was named Nihihari (newly opened) and the name has never changed.
A folk song of this area refers to shiratohofu Nihihari (distant Nihihari).
{The rest is omitted.}!° Sixteen miles from the district office is the
hamlet of Kasama. The road between the district office and Kasama
passes through the hills called Ashiho Yama. According to the elders,
a Tsuchikumo female chieftain named Abura Okime lived with her
people in these hills. Burial caves in one of the groves in the hamlet of
Kasama are known to have sheltered the Tsuchikumo." The existence of these caves gave rise to a folk song.
Kochitakeba If the rumors were too strident,
Wohatsuse Yama no I would take you
Ihaki nimo Even to the sarcophagus
Wite komora namu In the Wohatsuse Graves to hide;
Na kohi so wagimo Be not worried, my dearest.”
Although the document here refers to the district of Shirakabe, that section is
missing from the extant text.
'0 Village of Nihihari: The word denoting “village” here is expressed in the
Chinese graph li. In 715, the designation for “village” was changed to the Chinese
graph hsiang. Japanese commentators argue that the presence of the graph li,
which was in use prior to 715, indicates that this portion of the original draft was
prepared before 715 (see glossary, under go, sato, and gori-sei). The rest is omitted:
This is a copyist’s notation. Normally the description of a village or township would
provide more information about the condition of the land and/or the products of
the area.

District of Tsukuha
{East of this district is the district of Ubaraki and to the south is the
district of Kafuchi. On the west is Keno Gaha; to the north lies Mt.
Tsukuha. }
According to the elders, the land of Tsukuha was once called Ki
(fortress). During the reign of Prince Mimaki, a man named Tsukuha
was appointed kuni no miyatsuko of this area. Tsukuha was a kinsman
of the Uneme no Omi family. At the time of his appointment, Tsukuha
said, “I will name this land after myself so that my name will be remembered generation after generation.” So he discarded the original
name Ki and adopted the name Tsukuha for the district. {A folk song
mentions nigiri thi Tsukuha (leaves that wrap rice balls). The rest is
omitted. }!3
According to the elders, [Mt. Tsukuha’s popularity originated in
the following legend]. In the remote past, a Japanese ancestral deity
was travelling around visiting his descendants. As he rounded Mt.
Fuji, in the Suruga region, the sun was setting. So the ancestral deity
asked the goddess of Mt. Fuji for overnight shelter. {This goddess of
Mt. Fuji was the child of the ancestral deity. }"
The goddess of Mt. Fuji, [however, was reluctant to extend hospitality to the visiting deity.] “We are now observing a period of abstinence
for the new crops,” she said. “During this time [custom forbids us to
entertain outsiders in our households]. We cannot comply with your
wish. Pray [we beg] your forgiveness.”
The ancestral deity, who was both disappointed and furious, violently denounced the goddess of Mt. Fuji and all her household. “What
do I hear?” asked the visitor god. “How could you not let me stay? I
am your father,” he cried. “May my curse hereafter fall upon you; may
'> Uneme no Omi: Uneme were tributary women presented to the Yamato
ruler by local chieftains as a gesture of their submission. The Uneme no Omi may
have been a family placed in charge of these women.
'4 Throughout the Hitachi fudoki, legendary tales such as this one are introduced
with the set phrase “the elders say.” In translating these tales I have incorporated
the phrase into the appropriate sentences.
' There is a poem related to this crop-tasting ritual in Azuma Uta (see MYS, no.
3460).
The Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki 4]
the snow fall and cover you at all times; may you suffer from the bitterest
cold; may no one ever climb to visit you; and may no offerings be
given to you ever.”
Thus turned away, the ancestral deity went to Mt. Tsukuha and
asked to stay the night. The goddess of Mt. Tsukuha answered,
“Though we are observing a ceremonial period for the new crops, we
shall obey your will, my lord.” The goddess of Mt. Tsukuha ordered
food to be brought in and respectfully attended to the deity’s needs.
The ancestral deity was pleased, and said, “How lovable my descendant
is; how lofty her shrine stands! As heaven and earth would prosper
forever, and as sun and moon would shine forever, may her domain
prosper forever. May her people gather here to celebrate the good
harvest every year.”
Because of [the ancestral god’s curse], Mt. Fuji has always been
covered with snow and is inaccessible. [On the contrary,] Mt. Tsukuha
has always been [accessible. Folks have continued to come here],
gather together, sing, dance, eat, and drink without ceasing. {The
rest is omitted. }
Mt. Tsukuha has two distinct crests. The western peak, called
Male, is craggy and precipitous, standing high above the drifting
clouds. The eastern peak, called Female, is easier to climb, though
not without encountering rocks and stones along the way. On this
peak there is a spring from which water flows constantly. Men and
women from all over Azuma gather there every spring and autumn.
Some come on foot, others on horseback. All come in groups, bringing
food and drink, and enjoy festive nights there. These gatherings occur in the spring, when the flowers are blooming, and in autumn,
when the leaves are turning red. A local folk song says:
Tsukuhane ni “Why not gather together
Ahamu to At the festive night at Tsukuha.”
Thishi ko ha The one so promised me must have gone
Taga koto kikeba ka with someone else but me,
Mine ahazu kemu ya Since I sat up alone all night long.'®

corrupt that it is impossible to translate it without emendation. The translation
adopts Takeda Yukichi’s amendment, for it makes better sense in light of the

Another folk song goes:

Waga nemu yoro ha Without my sweetheart;
Haya mo akenukamo ya How I long for daybreak!
There are many such songs, far too numerous to list here. According
to the local folklore, if the girls did not receive token gifts from the
boys at this [popular] gathering, requesting their further association,
[their parents] would not consider their daughters to be women.”
[North of Mt. Tsukuha and] three miles west of the district office
lies Toba no Afumi [Toba shoal]. It is 3.3 miles long and 1.6 miles
wide. East of this [Toba shoal] is the district [office] of Tsukuha and
to the south is Keno Kaha. The west and north sides border on the
district of Nihihari, and the district of Shirakabe is on the northeast.

text: “To whose word did s/he listen? Has s/he joined him/her in the divine

'7 The MYS contains a long poem written by a noted courtier, Takahashi
Mushimaro, about a similar gathering (no. 1759). [Parents did not consider]: This
may also be interpreted as “did not pass muster as young women.” In an extended
sense, it could mean “girls who did not receive such gifts were considered to be
unpopular.”
'’ The so-called Nishino manuscript text, which is the basic text adopted by
Hisamatsu, appends the following description: “According to the elders, in the
year of Mizunoto Ushi [653], during the reign of the emperor [posthumously
known as Emperor Kotoku], who governed the realm from Toyosaki Palace at
Nagara in Naniha, Kafuchi and Ahizu of the Mononobe family petitioned Councillor Takamuku, who was the commissioner of Azuma, to allocate seven hundred
households from the districts of Tsukuha and Ubaraki. The district of Shida was
established with these seven hundred families. The territory of the district of Shida

Three miles north of the district office there is a well known as
Usuwi. According to the elders, when Prince Ohotarashi [posthumously
known as Emperor Keiko] set up camp on Ukishima (floating island),
there was no drinking water. Therefore, [the prince sent for a water
diviner] and let him divine [the site]. The well was dug. This well is
still in existence in the hamlet of Wokuri.
West of this well is the village of Takaku. According to the elders,
in the remote past, at the beginning of heaven and earth, when even
the plants could talk, the god Futsunushi descended from high heaven
to make an inspection tour of the Middle Land of the Reed Field (the
Japanese island). This god pacified the unruly in the mountains and
valleys of the Middle Land.!”
When he had subjugated all the unruly people and was planning to
return to high heaven, the god Futsunushi removed his august [belongings] from his person and left [them] here [in the village of Takaku
before] he ascended into high heaven riding on a white cloud. {Local
people call these [august items] Itsuno.} These [items] were his armor,
halberd, shield, sword, and a string of jewels. {The rest is ornitted.}
The inhabitants say that venison obtained in the swamps of this
area tastes stale, not quite as good as the meat of deer caught in the
dry land. In any case, there are so many deer in the area that they
remain plentiful, despite the large-scale deer hunts conducted by
residents from both {Shimotsufusa and Hitachi} provinces.
West of the village [of Takaku] is Ihina Shrine. The presiding
deity at this shrine is related to the god Ihina who resides in Mt.
Tsukuha.
was formerly a part of the land of Hitakami [distant country].” The text describes
these two men in terms of their official court ranks. Kafuchi was shosenjo and
Ahizu was daiitsujo. For the various ranking systems of this period, see Nihon shoki,
ed. Sakamoto Taro, Ienaga Saburo, Inoue Mitsusada, and Ono Susumu (Tokyo:
Iwanami Shoten, 1967), 2:622—23.
') When even the plants could talk: The use of such expressions is the ancients’
way of emphasizing the antiquity of the matters under discussion. It can be interpreted as “the time when the realm was not yet under the full control of the royal
house—or the central government.” “When plants could talk” also may be a
euphemism for a time when anyone who was strong enough could make a territorial claim by speaking or performing some magical formula.

This is the terminus of the Great Eastern Sea Route [Tokaido Road]
and the beginning of the Hitachi Road. When official messengers
come to this province, they first must wash their mouths and hands in
honor of the Great God of Kashima who resides in the district of
Kashima, east of Enoura. Only then may the messengers proceed farther
into the province. {The rest is omitted. }”°
[Hamlet of Norihama.] According to the elders, Prince Yamato Takeru
once toured the shore of Shida no Umi (Shida inlet) as far as the
place called Norihama, where he saw large quantities of edible seaweed
drying on the beach. {Locals call this nori}. That is why the village
was named Norihama (seaweed beach). {The rest is omitted. }
There is a hamlet called Ukishima (floating island) east of the
village of Norihama. {It is about two miles long and half a mile wide. }
It is surrounded by water; its terrain is a mixture of hills and fields.
There are fifteen households on the island. The tillable land amounts
to only about nineteen acres. [Those who] live [on this island] make
their living by producing salt [from sea water]. Nine shrines are found
there. [The islanders] exercise moderation in both speech and action.
{The rest is omitted.}
District of Ubaraki
{East of this district is the district of Kashima, and to the south is Saga
no Nagareumi. West of this district lies Mt. Tsukuha; on the north is
the district of Naka. }?!
According to the elders, in the past [this area was inhabited by]
the [two native groups known as] Kuzu {in the local dialect they are
called the Tsuchikumo and the Yatsukahagi}: Yama no Saheki and No
© The actual location of the harbor is quite far from the Kashima Shrine. What
this passage means is that the officials paid homage to the Kashima God from afar.
Great Eastern Sea Route: In olden days, travellers on the Tokaido Road would
have to take a ferry at the tip of Miura Peninsula to reach Hitachi Province. Hence
the designation “eastern sea route.”
*! Saga no Nagareumi: The word nagareumi is best described here as meaning
“inlet” or “estuary.” The Japanese language suffers from a paucity of words describing bodies of water, even though the country is surrounded by water.

no Saheki. [These subhuman creatures] dug caves all around [the
area] and lived in them. At the approach of people, they would hide
deep in the caves, coming out and wandering the fields only when
the people had left. Their nature was [like that of] wolves and night
owls, spying and stealing. They would never reconcile themselves with
a civilized approach.”
Kurosaka, a member of the Oho no Omi family [, devised a scheme
to exterminate the Kuzu]. While [the Kuzu] were away in the fields,
Kurosaka had his men place thorn branches in their caves. He then
ordered his horsemen to charge them in the fields. [In great excitement, the recalcitrants] rushed to their caverns but the thorn branches
barred their way and all were fatally wounded. Because of this, the
word meaning thorns, ubara, was adopted as the name of this agata
(imperial district). {That which is known as [the village of] Ubaraki
no Kohori is in the western section of the district of Naka. In the past,
the Kohori no Miyake (royal granary) was located there. In other
words, the village] belonged to the [old] district of Ubaraki. The
folklore refers to the district with the expression mizuyoru ubaraki no
kuni (Ubaraki, the land of thorns by the water).}
According to another story, Yama no Saheki and No no Saheki
became chiefs of the bandits and indulged in plundering and killing
[good people]. In an effort to exterminate them, Kurosaka constructed
a fortress made of thorn branches. This is why the area was named
Ubaraki (fortress of thorny branches). {Takekoro, the forebear of the
kuni no miyatsuko of Ubaraki, served the royal court of Princess Okinaga
Tarashi until the birth of Prince Homuda. Takekoro had eight children.
One of the eight, a boy, was named Tsukuha Omi, and he is the
forebear of the Yuwe no Muraji family in the district of Ubaraki.}”4
A river runs southwest of the Ubaraki District office. It is called
22 Kuzu: A derivation of kunisu, the older form of which was kuninushi, meaning
“master of the land.” Saheki: A generic term for aborigines, not necessarily indicative of any specific tribal or familial background.
3 Asata: An older designation, comparable to kohori or gun, which is translated
as “district.”
4 Takekoro: A quasi-mythological figure. The Takechi family in the Yamato
region claimed descent from Takekoro. Okinaga Tarashi: A quasi-mythological
figure in the Japanese imperial genealogy. Prince Homuda: A possible Japanese
unifier of the late fourth and early fifth centuries (see Aoki, Ancient Myths, 34-39).

Shizuku no Kaha. It originates on Mt. Tsukuha, flows down from west
to east, and penetrates the middle of the district where it empties
into [Sagano Umiat the beach called] Takahama. {The rest is omitted. }
[Takahama] is a place people visit in the spring and fall. They
come by land and sea. In springtime, the shore is decorated with
flowers of a thousand hues. In autumn, the banks are adorned with
leaves of a hundred colors. Warblers sing out from the field [behind]
the beach and graceful cranes wade in the shallows. Lads and lasses
from the farms and fishing villages throng the beach in droves; vendors
and farmers arrive and depart in small boats. How much mote so [it
is] in the summer months! The crowd gathers in the sizzling morning
and roasting evening, together with their companions and servants.
They pass the humid days sitting on the beach gazing into the water
[lost in their daydreams and thoughts]. As the evening wind brings
rustling tides, those who avoid the heat can forget troublesome worries;
as the shadows of the surrounding hills grow long, the cool air pleases
[soothes] the throng with respite [relief]. A poem composed at one of
these gatherings says:
Takahama ni The rolling waves
Kiyosuru nami no On the beach of Takahama:
Okitsu nami Even though the throng would come from
afar,
Yosu tomo yoraji I would not go with them,
Kora ni shi yoraba If I once rendered you my heart.
Another poem reads:
Takahama no At the rustling wind
Shita kaze sayagu At the lower beach of Takahama,
Imo wo kohi My heart yearns for the girl
Tsuma to ihaba ya Whom I wish to embrace;
Shiko to meshi tsu mo But alas, she called me “ugly fellow!”
There is a knoll called Kuhahara three miles east of the district
office. In the remote past, when he stopped on top of this small hill for
a meal, Prince Yamato Takeru ordered the men in charge of drinking
water to dig a new well. The water poured clear and fragrant from
the new well. There was no doubt that it was drinking water of superb
quality, and the prince said, “How pure is the water collected here!”

{In the local dialect it [the remark] reads yoku tamareru mitsu kana. }
This is how the village of Tamari received its name.”
District of Namekata
{The east, south, and west sides of this district are surrounded by
lakes. On the north is the district of Ubaraki.}
According to the elders, in the year of Mizunoto Ushi [653], during
the reign of the emperor [Kotoku] who governed the realm from
Toyosaki Palace at Nagara in Naniha, two magistrates of this region
petitioned Councillor Takamuku, who was the governor general of
Azuma, to create a new district by relocating eight villages from the
jurisdiction of Ubaraki and seven villages from the territory of Naka.
Altogether, there were more than seven hundred households in these
fifteen villages.”©
The two magistrates making this petition were Shoitsuge Mibu no
Muraji Maro and Daikemu Mibu no Atahi Onoko. Takamuku no Omi,
the governor general, was assisted by his deputy, Nakatomi-Hataorita.”’
The petition was granted and the new district established. This was
the district of Namekata. A district office was built accordingly.
The district of Namekata was named after a comment made by
Prince Yamato Takeru while he was on a military campaign in the
vicinity. [After pacifying the region] north of the lake, the prince
came to this area. He stopped at the spring of Tsukino (zelkova field),
and while washing his hands he intentionally dropped one of his jewels
into the water [to bless the spring]. The spring is still in existence in
25 Men in charge of drinking water: Mohitoribe in the original. Even today, the
old folks in this area pronounce mitsu as meaning water, the sound of which is now
mizu. The Hitachi fudoki is one of the rare documents containing this kind of
information.
26 Most texts do not use the phrase that can be translated as “seven villages from
the territory of Naka.” This translation follows Akimoto in his correction of the
text.
27 Shoitsuge was the 24th rank under the system stipulated in the 3d year of
Tenji. Daiken (or daikemu) was the 25th rank in the same system (see also note 18,
above).

the village of Namekata. It is called Tama no Shimizu (clear water of
the jewelled spring) .”%
Resuming his journey, Prince Yamato Takeru arrived at Arahara no
Woka where he had his meal. After looking about him in all four directions, the prince turned to his lords-in-waiting, and said, “I caused my
palanquin to stop here so that I could take a stroll. As I gaze into the
distance from the top of this hill,” he continued, “this land is extremely
appealing. Clouds circle above the ridges of the mountains, while
mists are creeping through the dells and valleys below. The configuration of this land is both extraordinary and beautiful. It is fitting to call
it namekuhashi (scenic land).” Later, people began calling this district
Namekata.” {The folklore refers to the district by the name tachisame
furi Namekata no Kuni, meaning “Namekata, the land of showers.”}
The site from which Prince Yamato Takeru viewed the four corners
of this land is a plateau called Arahara. Descending from this plateau,
the prince came to Ohoya Gaha where he took a boat up the river.
[When he reached the middle of the river] the rudder broke. Ohoya
Gaha was therefore renamed the Kajinashi Gaha (rudderless river).
The river is the boundary between the districts of Ubaraki and
Namekata. The many kinds of fish, such as silver carp, obtained from
this river are too numerous to be listed in total.
When he had proceeded further toward the border, Prince Yamato
Takeru saw a wild duck in the sky, and he shot it with an arrow. The
bird fell to the ground. The place where the bird fell was named
Kamono (Kamo field). The condition of the soil in this place is such
that no plants grow there. North of there, however, there are virgin
woods where trees grow luxuriantly. These are the ichihi, kunugi, maple,
and hinoki (cypress).*° In the woods there is a rectangular pond. This
8 To bless the spring: To drop a jewel into water seems to have been a symbolic
means of claiming suzerainty. A comparable deed is related in the Izumo fudoki
(see Aoki, Izumo fudoki, 83).
? Namekuhashi is the reading given by Akimoto. Hisamatsu reads it as
Namekata. If one follows the latter, the last sentence would read, “It is still called
Namekata.”
*® Tchihi is the Quercus gilva Blume. Kunugi is the Quercus acutissima Carruth. As
for the last plant in the text, translated as “cypress,” there has been some debate
over the reading of the graph. This translation follows Akimoto.

is actually an irrigation reservoir built by the people of the area during
the term of office of the governor general of Azuma, Takamuku no
Omi. North of the reservoir there is a branch shrine of the god of
Katori. The soil around this shrine is fertile and plants grow there in
abundance.*!
West of the district office is a ferry used for crossing Namekata no
Umi. In the sea grows miru (a small edible seaweed) and a kind of
seaweed from which salt can be obtained after burning. The various
types of fish obtained from this lake are too numerous to be listed.
Only whales have never been seen in this lake.
There is a grove east of the district office. A shrine of the local
agata god is located in this grove.” A cold spring in the grove serves
as a meeting place for the local people who gather here to draw water
and drink. The spring is called Ohowi (large well).
There is a large zelkova tree south of the district office. Its northern
branches trail to the ground and the top grows as if it is trying to
reach the sky. There once was a marsh near this tree. Even today, in
a prolonged rainy season, the courtyard of the district office becomes
flooded. There are a few orange trees growing in the courtyard.
Northwest of the district office is the village of Tega. Long ago, a
Saheki named Tega lived there, and the village was named after him.
North of this village there is a branch shrine of the Great God of
Kashima. The soil of the hills and fields around this shrine is fertile.
Pasania, chestnut, bamboo, and miscanthus grow abundantly there.
North of this shrine is the hamlet of Sone. Here, too, there lived a
Saheki named Sonehiko. The village is still named after him. Today,
a posting-station is situated there. It is called the posting-station of
Sone.*4

33 Akimoto adds kunugi before pasania. The grass-hand script for the word plants
can be taken to be the graph for kunugi.
34 The name Sone did not necessarily derive from a native chieftain’s name
because the word sone in archaic Japanese means “the place near the water.” See
Matsuoka Shizuo, Hitachi fudoki monogatari (Tokyo: Tokyo Shoin, 1928), 65.
50 The Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki
According to the elders, during the reign of the emperor [Keitai]
who governed the realm from Tamaho Palace at Ihare, there was a
man called Matachi of the Yahazu family.** Matachi planned to reclaim
the valley filled with miscanthus west of the district office. His ricefarming scheme was disrupted, however, by a plague of snakes. {People
of this area refer to all snakes as yatsu no kami (valley gods). [The
snakes that disturbed Matachi’s reclamation project] are said to have
had horns. [The local people believed that the horned snakes would
harm them.] They [also] believed that when fleeing from the snake,
they must never look back. Anyone who turned his face to the snakes
would suffer a curse upon his household—he and his entire family
would perish, leaving no descendants. [Even today,] snakes are
numerous in the vicinity of the district office. }**
Matachi, outraged by the sudden appearance of the snakes, armed
himself against them. Taking up his halberd, he slew several, and the
rest retreated to the foot of the hill [on the east].*” Matachi then
thrust a long cane into the irrigation ditch [which his people had dug
for him] to mark his territory, and said to the snakes, “[The land
extending] from this place to the hill is your territory. [The land extending] from this landmark to the valley, however, is mine, and it is
reserved for my people’s farming.” He continued, “Do not violate this
boundary. Be not resentful of this decision, for I shall [construct a
shrine for you and] serve as the priest there. My descendants will
respectfully provide you with offerings.”** Thereupon Matachi erected
a shrine to consecrate the spirits of the serpents. He then reclaimed
about twenty-four acres of rice field [for the upkeep of the shrine].
His family has retained the priestship of this shrine ever since.

Emperor Kotoku]*®” who governed the realm from Toyosaki Palace at

Nagara in Naniha, this valley was occupied by Mibu no Muraji Maro.
Maro constructed an embankment around the irrigation ditch there.
At that time, the same kind of snakes again massed together in the
pasania trees beside the irrigation ditch. Time passed, and the reptiles
showed no sign of evacuating the treetops. Realizing that the snakes
were not going to leave, Maro proclaimed in a loud voice, “This irrigation ditch is here to aid my people. Who are you to disregard this
aim?” Presently he issued an order to the laborers engaged in exterminating the snakes: “Kill all the insects and animals, wherever you see
them. Don’t be afraid, and show therm no mercy.” When Maro finished
his declaration, the vicious snakes disappeared.*° Today, this ditch is
called Shihiwi no Ike (pond by the pasania well). Pasania trees grow
around the irrigation ditch. [Near the ditch there is] a well, which
yields fresh water and thus has given rise to the name [Shihiwi no
Ike]. This [well] is located on the highway leading to Kashima.
There is a village 2.3 miles south of the district office. This is the
village of Wotaka, named after an unruly saheki [chieftain] who lived
in this area in the remote past. In this village, on the east side of the
highway, is a pond, which was constructed by Councillor Tagima while
he was serving as the provincial governor. A large number of monkeys
and wild boar live on the hill west of the pond. Plants are also abundant
on this hill.*!
South of the pond is another small hill called Kujira Woka (whale
hill). Long ago, a whale crawled up the hill and lay down there, and
so the place came to be called Kujira Woka. Beside this hill is a pond
called Kuriya no Ike (chestnut-house pond). The nuts of the chestnut trees around this pond grow so big that the pond came to be
known as Kuriya no Ike. [Located] there is another branch shrine of
the god of Katori. [It is] north [of the pond built by Councillor Tagima].
Village of Asafu. Long ago, [wild] hemp grew abundantly beside the
marsh that surrounds this area. The stem of the hemp was as thick as
bamboo and it grew to a height of approximately ten feet. The hills

around this village are populated with monkeys and wild boar. Pasania,
chestnut, zelkova, and ichihi trees also grow in these hills. During the
reign of the emperor [posthumously known as Emperor Tenmu], who
governed the realm from Kiyomihara Palace in Asuka, Wokoro of the
Takerube family in the village of Ohofu caught some wild horses [which
were fit for riding] in this field and presented them to the central
Japanese court. They were what are known as Namekata horses, although some people mistakenly refer to them as Ubaraki horses.”
Six miles south of the district office is the village of Kasumi. According to ancient tradition, Prince Ohotarashi climbed to the top of Tomi
no Woka (the Tomi Plateau) in Inami in the land of Shimotsufusa.
He strolled around, gazing at the panoramic view. Looking to the
east, the prince exclaimed to his lords-in-waiting, “Blue waves are
rising and falling in the sea, and a pink mist is creeping over the land.
How beautiful is the land I now behold in the mist!” As a result of
these princely remarks, the people named the area Kasumi (mist).
There is a shrine on a hill east of the village of Kasumi. Elm, zelkova,
camellia, pasania, bamboo, yadake (arrow-shaft bamboo), and
snakesbeard grow abundantly on this hill. A sandbar can be seen in
the sea [lake] west of this village. This is Nihihari no Su (Nihihari
shallow). The place is so named because one can see Mt. Tsukuha in
the Land of Nihihari from that sandbar.#
Three miles from here [the village of Kasumi] is the hamlet of
Itaku. This hamlet, which is located near Namekata no Umi, comprises
the posting-station of Itaku. West of the posting-station is a grove of
elm. This grove is the place to which Prince Womi was exiled during
the reign of the emperor [posthumously known as Emperor Tenmu]
who governed the realm from Kiyomihara [Palace] in Asuka. Abundantly obtainable in the sea [lake] are [two kinds of] seaweed: [one

[Also obtainable are] round clam, mud snail, and clam.“
According to the elders, the prince [posthumously known as Emperor Sujin] who governed Ohoyashima (the great eight islands) from
Mizukaki Palace at Shiki, sent Take Kashima {who is the forebear of
the kuni no miyatsuko of Naka} to suppress the unruly rascals of the
eastern hinterland.*
Take Kashima (Brave Kashima) and his soldiers crushed a large number
of rebels and subsequently arrived at Aba no Shima (Aba Island)
where they were to take shelter overnight. While reconnoitering the
surrounding vistas, Take Kashima noticed smoke rising in the east.
Suspecting that there might be people living there, he and his troops
[were alerted]. He looked to the sky and prayed [to the heavenly
deities], “If the smoke be that of friends, may it drift toward us. If it be
the smoke of our enemies, may it disappear over the sea.” The smoke
thereupon floated toward the sea, betraying the presence of an enemy.
There were [in fact] two Kuzu who had made themselves leaders
[of the recalcitrants] in that area. These were Yasakashi and Yatsukushi. [Together with their followers, they] dug into the ground, built
bunkers, and lived in them. They spied on the imperial troops, and
thus remained secure. [Whenever they showed themselves and] Take
Kashima released his men to pursue them, the recalcitrants would
flee to their bunkers, shut the gates, and defend themselves. Presently,
Take Kashima formed a grand scheme [to eradicate the recalcitrants
from both land and sea. First, he] selected soldiers willing to die, and
placed them in the recesses of the hills. [There the warriors] equipped
themselves with tools and weapons to destroy the enemy. [Second,
Take Kashima ordered his other men to] walk in a splendid procession
44 Prince Womi: According to the Nihon shoki, Emperor Tenmu banished Prince
Womi from the Yamato Court. There has been some debate among Japanese
historians over the location of his place of exile. The information provided here
seems to answer the question. See Matsuoka, Hitachi fudoki monogatari, 69; MYS,
23-24; and Sakamoto et al., Nihon shoki, 2:419, 420, 33n.

on the beach and put the boats and rafts into the water. [In the water
these rafts and boats were] tied together side by side, forming a makeshift stage for dancing. Canopies overhung the stage like floating
clouds, their colors waving in dazzling hues. The tunes of flutes and
zithers harmonized with the sound of the waves. Thus, the soldiers
performed the Kishima dance for seven days and nights.*
Observing this unusual performance of music and dancing, all the
rebels came down to the shore. While the enemy was thus carried
away by the fantasy at the shore, Take Kashima had his cavalry close
the gates of the enemy stronghold and attack them from the rear. All
members of the band were taken prisoner or burned to death at once.
At the time [there was widespread comment on this carnage]—
comments such as itaku korosu (to kill relentlessly) and futsu ni kiru
(to slay all indiscriminately). The township of Itaku and the hamlet
of Futsuna trace their names to these expressions. [Two other places
also were named after the hearsay concerning this massacre.] These
are the village of Yasukiri (to kill easily) and the hamlet of Esaki (to
split skillfully).
There is a shallow area in the water south of Itaku, covering about
a square mile. In springtime people from the districts of Kashima and
Namekata go there to gather clams and other shellfish. Clams, round
clams, and several other kinds of shellfish are obtained there.‘
About four and a half miles from the district office is the village of
Tagima. According to the elders [this village was named after the
poor road conditions in its vicinity]. When Prince Yamato Takeru
visited this area on a hunting trip, a Saheki named Torihiko was living
there. Because this chieftain would not submit to Prince Yamato
Takeru, the prince schemed against him and killed him.
Afterward the prince returned to his camp, which was at Yakatano.
To reach the camp he and his troops had to follow a very narrow and
rugged road. Because of the bad road, the area was named Tagima

(rugged area). The village is thus called Tagima. {In the local dialect,
people say tagitagishi, meaning “rugged.”} Although the soil is very
poor in this field, the gromwell plant grows there. There are two branch
shrines of the great gods of Kashima and Katori in this village. Ichihi,
hahaso, chestnut, and kunugi grow in the groves surrounding the village.
A large number of wild boar, monkeys, and wolves also live there.**
South of the village of Tagima is the village of Kitsu. In the remote
past, two Kuzu chieftains named Kitsuhiko and Kitsuhime dwelled
there. [The male chieftain, Kitsuhiko,] did not recognize the royal
authorities and disobeyed an august command issued by Prince Yamato
Takeru when he passed through the area. The prince therefore slew
the man with his mighty sword. This action so frightened the female
chief, Kitsuhime, that she raised a white flag to signal her surrender
and prostrated herself on the road before the prince. The prince
granted her amnesty and released her followers.
Kitsuhime was so grateful to the prince that she served him wholeheartedly as he proceeded to his camp at Wonukino. There Kitsuhime
and her sisters waited upon him hand and foot, supplying all his needs.
Wind and rain did not faze Kitsuhime. She never failed to serve the
prince under any circumstances. Prince Yamato Takeru was very
touched by her loyalty, and came to feel affection toward the women.
This is how Wonukino alternately came to be called Uruhashi no Wono
(lovely small field/small field of loving).
South of Wonukino is the village called Ta no Sato. During the
reign of Princess Okinaga Tarashi [posthumously known as Empress
Jingu], a man named Kotsuhiko lived in this area. He served as emissary to Korea three times during his life, and because of his service
[the princess] granted him rice fields in this area. This is why the
village is called Ta no Sato (village of the rice field).
In this area there is also a field called Hatsumu. It was named
after a deed of Prince Yamato Takeru. While spending the night here,
the prince repaired the edges of his bow and restrung it. This is how
the field came to be called Hatsumu no No (bow-edge field). On the
shore of the lake north of Hatsumu no No there is a branch shrine of

the Great God of Kashima. The condition of the soil is poor. Only a
few scattered ichihi, hahaso, elm, and bamboo grow there.”
South of this [Ta no Sato] are the villages of Afuka and Ohofu.
According to the elders, [the origins of both place names are related
to Prince Yamato Takeru. The village of Ohofu was named after the
dining hut of his lordship]. When Prince Yamato Takeru was staying
at a temporary palace at Wokazaki, in Afuka, he had his dining hut
constructed at the water’s edge. He would travel back and forth between the dining hut and his living quarters by walking over boats
tied together to form a [sort of pontoon] bridge. [The present-day
name] Ohofu is traceable to the name of the prince’s dining hut,
Ohohi (grand meal). Afuka was named after the meeting of Prince
Yamato Takeru with his wife Princess Oho Tachibana (Great Orange),
who came down from Yamato to visit him. They met here and thus
the place came to be called Afuka (meeting). {[The description of]
the district of Namekata [has been copied] without abridgment. }
District of Kashima
{East of this district is Oho Umi (great sea). To the south is Aze no
Minato (waterway of Aze), which forms the boundary between
Shimotsufusa and Hitachi provinces. On the west is a lake. To the
north is Atakana no Minato, which forms the boundary between the
districts of Naka and Kashima. }*°

The Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki ow
petitioned Councillor Takamuku, the governor general of Azuma, to
establish a new district in honor of the Great God of Kashima.
[Councillor Takamuku therefore ordered that] one village south
of Karuno in the former territory of the kuni no miyatsuko of Unakami
[an eighth-century district in Shimotsufusa Province] be designated
for this purpose. Likewise, Councillor Takamuku commanded that
five villages north of Samuta in the old territory of the kunino miyatsuko
of Naka [an eighth-century district of Hitachi Province] be designated as well. The new district established from these six villages was
named Kashima and it was dedicated to the Great God of Kashima.
Today there are three shrines dedicated to this god. They are the
Heavenly Great Shrine [of Kashima], Sakato Shrine, and Numawo
Shrine. [Kashima Shrine is the collective name for all three shrines.]
The Great God of Kashima is also known by the name Heavenly Great
God of Kashima. {The folklore refers to this land with the expression
ararefuru (hail falling) Kashima. }>!
[In the remote past, hegemony was not yet established by the royal
family in Yamato; hence] the distinction between high heaven and
earth was not clear. The ancestral deities [who produced the rulers of
Japan] wished to correct this situation [and establish hegemony].
Therefore, the ancestral deities called a meeting of a multitude of
gods. {In the local tongue these ancestral deities are referred to as
kamiromi (goddesses) and kamirogi (gods).}°?
At the meeting in the Plain of High Heaven the ancestral deities
named the Japanese Islands Toyo Ashihara no Mizuho no Kuni (the
land of beautiful reed plains), and decreed that this land would be
governed by the imperial grandson [known as Prince Ninigi].
5! Heavenly Great God of Kashima: At present the Kashima Shrine (Kashima
Jingu) has three deities enshrined in it: Futsunushi, Take Mikazuchi, and Ame no
Koyane. In the Court-oriented mythology, the first two went to Izumo to undertake negotiations prior to Ninigi’s descent. The third is a tutelary deity of the
Nakatomi (Fujiwara) family.

[In order to fulfill this prophecy] the parental deities dispatched
the Great God of Kashima to herald the coming of their grandson.
The heavenly gods called the palace of this herald deity Hi no Kashima
(the shining palace of Kashima), whereas before it was customarily
called the Toyo Kashima (palace of Kashima the bounteous).** {According to the oral traditions of this area, [when the ancestral deities
entrusted this world to their grandson Ninigi] by decree, [the land
was filled with] unruly spirits, araburu kami tachi (recalcitrants). The
unruly spirits were everywhere. Even rocks and plants were believed
to possess prophetic natures. The world was as obnoxious as flies in
early summer. Furthermore, vicious creatures were everywhere as apparent as a fire glowing in the night. The Great God of Kashima came
down from high heaven to rectify this situation. }
Later, during the reign of Prince Mimaki [posthumously known as
Emperor Sujin] who governed the realm for the first time, several
offerings were presented to this meritorious Great God of Kashima.
The offerings consisted mainly of instruments of war, including ten
swords, two spears, two iron bows, two iron arrows, four quivers, a tool
made of cast iron, a sheet of steel, a horse, a saddle, two mirrors, and
bundles of coarse silk in five different colors.”
{According to the local traditions of this area, the Great God of
Kashima once appeared to Prince Mimaki. [When ne was in Yamato, ]
Prince Mimaki saw a figure clad in a white robe standing on top of
Mt. Ohosaka. The white figure carried a white spear, and said, “Worship me in the proper manner and I will stand by thy side. I shall cause
thee to rule whatever territories thou desirest to govern.” Prince
Mimaki hastily summoned his favorites to consult with them on the
matter. Among them was Kikikatsu (Wise Listener), of the great
Nakatomi family, who advised, “This is the god’s pronouncement. He
is the Great God of Kashima. He appeared in order to remind you
that you are the one to whom the ancestral deities entrusted the rule

of these Great Eight Islands.” Prince Mimaki was awed at hearing
this and presented the above-mentioned offerings to the shrine of the
Great God of Kashima. }°°
Shrine Households. There are sixty-five households assigned to Kashima
Shrine. {In the beginning there were only eight households serving
this shrine. Fifty more were added during the reign of the emperor
[posthumously known as Emperor Kotoku] who governed the realm
from Toyosaki Palace at Nagara in Naniha. During the reign of the
emperor [posthumously known as Emperor Tenmu], who governed
the realm from Kiyomihara Palace in Asuka, nine more households
joined them, making a total of sixty-seven. Later, in the year of Kanoe
Tora [690], at the time of another regrouping of the shrine households,
two households were redesignated. Hence there are now sixty-five
shrine households. }>”
It was during the reign of the emperor [posthumously known as
Emperor Tenji], who held his court at Ohotsu in Afumi, that an emissary was sent to erect a large shrine dedicated to the Great God of
Kashima. Since then, the reconstruction or repair of this shrine has
been carried out [by imperial craftsmen].*
Every year in the seventh month there is a festival during which
large boats are built and dedicated to Tsu no Miya, the branch shrine
of the Great God of Kashima. [This shrine is located on the beach
that faces the lake.] According to the elders, this custom of the boat
[dedication] began during the reign of Prince Yamato Takeru. One
day the Great God of Kashima said to Sayama of the Nakatomi family,
“You shall hereafter be placed in charge of my divine boats.” Sayama
answered, “I shall respectfully obey your command. | dare not decline
this commission.” The following morning the Great God of Kashima
*6 Some commentators suggest that Kikikatsu, a legendary ancestor of the
Nakatomi, was the one who received the mission from the white figure. This
translation follows Sahara Yoshiatsu who believes that it was Mimaki. See “Hitachi

(Tokyo: Koten Zenshu Kankokai, 1926).

60 The Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki
again appeared to Sayama, saying, “I placed your boats in the lake.”
Sayama looked at the lake. The boats were not in the water but on
top of a hill beside it.”
Sometime later, the Great God of Kashima said to Sayama, “The
boats are now on the hill.” Looking at the hill, Sayama saw that the
boats were not there but had been placed in the lake. After many
similar experiences, Sayama came to dread the god’s pronouncements.
He therefore constructed three boats—each about twenty feet in
length—and for the first time dedicated them to the use of the Great
God of Kashima. [This is how the festival of the boats came to be
associated with this branch shrine of the Great God of Kashima.]®°
[The festival of the Kashima Shrine is celebrated by the Urabe
(diviner) family] on the tenth day of the fourth month every year. The
members of the Urabe [and their associates] gather at the shrine to
observe this festival. Day and night they enjoy drinking and dancing.
This is one of their songs:
Arasaka no This new wine
Kami no misake wo Of the god,
Tage to You made me drink
Thikeba kamo yo I am beside myself,
Waga wehi ni kemu Hence.®!
The people of the Urabe [who belong to this shrine] live in the
vicinity of the shrine, which is located on a plateau overlooking the
Oho Umi [great sea] in the east and the lake in the west. Peasant
dwellings dot the adjacent hills and dells.”
In the pre-Taika period this branch shrine seems to have been independent
and worshiped by local people, most likely seafarers.
© For more on the Nakatomi and the Kashima Shrine, see Aoki, Ancient Myths,

6! There are plays on words in this poem. Arasaka is a pillow word for kami,
which has two connotations, one meaning “to chew” and the other meaning
“gods.” At the same time, the prefix ara, of arasaka, means “new/newly.” Hence,
the expression arasaka no kami no misake means “this newly brewed wine of god.”
Tage to thike ba kamo yo literally means “because you told me to drink.”
® The Urabe family was kin to the Nakatomi. Extant records suggest that the
Nakatomi had a higher status than the Urabe. See Hirano Kunio, Taika zendai

The natural configuration of this area is nearly ideal. Trees and
grasses grow so thick and high that they form natural fences and
walls. Even the houses on the high ridges are protected from wind by
the surrounding pine trees and clumps of bamboo. The place is blessed
with abundant water. Many brooks and springs are found nestled between the knolls and dells. People living up in the hills can always
dig deep wells for good water. Vines cover the walls of these wells. In
the springtime there is an unforgettable fragrance from the various
flowers in bloom. In the autumn one cannot help but admire the brocade of the leaves. It is as though this is the territory of invisible gods
and the land of hermits. Its beauty cannot be described by the human
tongue.
South of the Kashima Shrine is the district office. North of the
shrine is a marsh called Numawo (marsh tail). [If we are to believe]
the stories told by the elders, this is the marsh whose water ran down
from high heaven in the remote past. Edible lotus roots are obtained
from this marsh. Their taste is superb. No lotus roots obtained elsewhere
can match those obtained here. The lotus roots from this marsh are
also used for medicinal purposes. Carp and silver carp live in the marsh.
The district office was formerly located near this marsh. Numerous
orange trees now growing on the site bear delicious fruit.%
Less than a mile east of the present district office is [the popular]
Takahama Beach. On the beach is a shell mound composed of sand
and shells from the Great Sea. Pine groves cover the mound. Pasania
and kunugi also grow on the mound. [Spring water flows] under the
pine trees. The spring is located on the southeastern part [of this
beach]. It is about fifty feet in circumference. Clear water is always
obtainable there.™
[As one proceeds farther down the beach to the southeast, passing
a series of pine groves, the name changes to Wakamatsu Beach. Iron
ore is obtainable there.] In the first year of Kyoun [704], Uneme no
6 Edible lotus: This is the Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. According to Taoist beliefs,
the lotus provides a long life to those who eat its root. The Japanese still consider it
a delicacy.
64 Most texts give the location of the spring as the “eastwestern” part of the
beach. Akimoto takes this as an error and amends it to “southeastern.” The amendment fits the actual topography.
62 The Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki
Asomi, the provincial governor of Hitachi, directed the blacksmith
Ohomaro of the Sahi family to make swords from iron ore obtained at
Wakamatsu Beach. The pine groves stretch about ten miles between
[the Takamatsu] and Wakamatsu beaches, [the latter of which] belongs
to the village of Karuno.® Matsuhodo and its root [China root] are
found in these woods every year.
At the south end of Wakamatsu Beach is a place called Wakamatsu
no Ura (Wakamatsu harbor). It is located north of Aze no Minato (the
waterway of Aze), which forms the boundary between Shimotsufusa
and Hitachi provinces. Iron sand from the area around Aze no Minato
produces unusually sharp swords. However, one cannot simply go there
and cut trees or collect sand at will, because the area is within the
territory belonging to the Kashima Shrine. The village of Hama
(beach) is located six miles south of the district office. The pine groves
that cover its eastern side enclose a large marsh. This is called Samuta,
and it is about a mile and a half in circumference. Carp and silver
carp are obtained there.®
The rice paddies in the villages of Shima and Karuno are rather
wet. The wreckage of a large ship has washed ashore on the beach
east of the village of Karuno. The beach is on the Great Sea. The ship
is about forty-seven yards long and thirty yards wide. It is decayed
and buried in the sand. {[It is said to be the hulk of] a ship built at
the order of the emperor [posthumously known as Emperor Tenji who
held his court at Ohotsu] in Afumi. During his reign the emperor had
the shipwrights at Ihaki of Michinoku Province [the northern neighbor
of Hitachi Province] build a large ship to be used for a survey of the
frontier. The ship was wrecked en route and drifted to shore here. }*
[According to tradition,] there is a love story about the Unawi no
Matsuhara (pine grove of young lovers) on the southern part of this
beach. {Local people give the young lovers in the story the names

Kami no Otoko (Son of God) and Kami no Otome (Daughter of God).}
The boy was from Samuta [the former territory of the kuni no miyatsuko]
of Naka, and the girl was from Aze [former territory of the kuni no
miyatsuko] of Unakami. Their beauty was well known among the villagers. The boy and girl [lived some distance apart and] thus they
knew each of other only through the village’s rumors about their beauty.
They yearned to meet, and their yearning turned to burning desire.
After many months, they met one day by chance at the regional
sonegfest. {Local people call this gathering utagaki or kagahi.} The boy
composed a poem for the girl:
lyazeru no To the twig of the small branch of pine,
Aze no ko Having tied a charm strip firm;
Matsu ni yufu shide te You must have been pining for me,
Wa wo furi miyu mo Oh, lovely girl from Aze.
Azeko shi maha mo I will dance with you.”
The girl replied:

Tatamu to ihe do The multitude I am,
Nase no ko ga You have singled me out already,
Yasoshima kakuri Have you not, my love?
Wa wo mi sahashiri Look at you, so hastily running toward me!”
Having finally met, the sweethearts wished only to be alone in
each other’s arms, and they declared their love. In fear of being discovered by the others, they took shelter among the pine trees some
distance from the crowd. There they sat hand in hand, knee to knee,
telling each other of their long-restrained yearning. The waiting was
over and new joys were welcoming them.
The autumn night was beautiful. Cool breezes brushed their bodies.
Cranes could be seen landing here and there on the moonlit beach.
The voices of wild geese in the mountains blended with the whispering
pines overhead. [There were no other sounds.] In the hills even the

spring water ran soundlessly over the rocks. As the serene night wore
on, a mist rose to cover the land. [The lovers’ fancies] saw multicolored leaves flutter about nearby and heard sapphire waves roar on
the distant beach. They experienced that night the utmost happiness
and rapture. Speaking honeyed words, the two were oblivious to the
approach of daybreak.
They were suddenly awakened by the cockcrow. As dawn came,
dogs began to bark. The young lovers did not know what to do in the
daylight. They were so terrified of being seen by the villagers that
they wished only to beome pine trees. [The Great God of Kashima
must have felt merciful, for he] transformed the couple into two pine
trees. The lad became a pine called Namimatsu (behold me not) and
the lass became a pine called Kotsumatsu (cut me not). These names
have never been altered.”
The village of Shirotori is located ten miles north of the district
office. According to the elders, the name of the village originated
from an episode that occurred during the reign of Prince Ikume [posthumously known as Emperor Suinin].’’? One day the villagers noticed
white birds flying overhead. Strangely, upon landing the birds turned
into young girls. As maidens, during the day they gathered rocks and
pebbles, which they piled up to form dikes. Each evening they would
again become white birds and fly away, always returning the following
morning to work as maidens. But, as fast as the maidens worked, the
rocks were always washed away by the action of the waves. Days passed
with little progress on the dikes, and the maidens of the white birds
began to sing this song:
Shirotori no With wings the white birds
Ha ga tsutsumi wo Piled rocks up high;
Tsutumu tomo But alas, they are all washed away!
" The word kotsu (of Kotsumatsu) can also mean “yearning,” hence “yearning
pine.” For another example, see MYS, no. 3548.
” Traditionally, Prince Ikume is thought to have been related to the princes
Ohotarashi (Emperor Keiko) and Homuchiwake. The latter is known to have had
a speech impairment caused by the curse of Ohokuninushi (see Aoki, Izumo
fudoki, 64).
The Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki 65
Arafuma mo uki ha White wings, too,
Ko-e Ave tired and broken!”
Finally, singing this song, the white birds flew away and never returned.
This is why the village was named Shirotori (white birds). {The rest
is omitted. }
South of the village of Shirotori is Tsunowore Beach. According to
local tradition, a huge serpent lived in this area long ago. The animal
wanted to reach the Great Sea, so it tried to dig a tunnel under the
beach. The serpent broke his horn while digging, and so the place
was named Tsunowore (horn-breaking).
According to another version, the etymology is related to Prince
Yamato Takeru. When the prince was staying at this place, there was
no drinking water for him to enjoy with his meal. His servants dug a
well using the antlers of deer, and [some of] the antlers broke during
the digging. This is why the place came to be called Tsunowore. {The
rest is omitted. }
District of Naka
{East of this district is the Great Sea. On the south are the districts of
Kashima and Ubaraki. Bordering on the west is a large mountain,
which forms the boundary between the district of Nihihari and
Shimotsu Keno Province. To the north is the district of Kuji.} “4
{The beginning [of this section] has been omitted.} There is a
hill about half a mile west of the posting-station of Hiratsu. This hill
is called Ohokushi. In the remote past, there was a giant with arms so
long that while sitting far inland he could reach all the way to the
beach and dig clams at the seashore. After eating the clams, the
giant would throw the shells in a pile. Eventually so many shells accumulated that the pile became a hill. So the people at this time named

The giant’s footprint was sixty yards long and forty yards wide.
When he urinated, it made a huge hole forty yards in diameter. {The

The Village of Ubaraki. There is a hill called Kurefushi Yama north of
this village. According to the elders, a brother and sister once lived
in this village. The brother was Nukahiko and the sister was
Nukahime. One night while the sister was in a sleeping chamber
alone, a man whose name is unknown [approached her]. His nightly
visits continued. Each evening the man would come to court [the
girl,] always leaving her the following day, and finally Nukahime agreed
to become his wife. One night she became pregnant.
When her time of delivery came, Nukahime gave birth to a small
snake. The baby snake would not talk during the daytime, and would
talk to his mother only at night. Surprised and awed, the mother and
her brother grew to believe that this was the child of a god. They
placed it in a clean bowl and set it on a raised altar [in their home].
Overnight the baby snake grew as large as the bowl. The mother and
her brother transferred it to a larger vessel, and again the snake grew
to fill the vessel overnight.
Every day Nukahiko and Nukahime moved the snake to a larger
vessel until eventually they had used all the bowls and vessels in the
house. At this point, Nukahime, the mother, said, “From the speed
with which you grow it is obvious that you are not an ordinary snake
but a child of divine nature. In our current circumstances, we can no
longer afford to raise you. Pray go to your father’s place. Remain at
our place no longer.”
The snake-child was saddened by his mother’s pronouncement.
But when he dried his tears, he said, “I shall respectfully obey your
command. I dare not go against your will, Mother.” Then he continued,
“But now I am all alone. I have no one to go with me. Pray take pity
on me, Mother. Give me one attendant to care for me.”
Nukahime replied, “As you can see, in this household there is no
one but your mother and uncle. No one can go with you. It would be
beyond our means, [my son.]”
The Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki 67
The baby snake, who resented his mother’s words, became indignant
and speechless. [Revealing his true mood,] as he was about to leave
he shook his uncle with great force, killing him. In alarm, the mother
threw a tray at the child. The snake lost its power to ascend. Unable
to rise, it turned into a hill.
The vessels and jars in which the snake was raised are preserved
in the hamlet of Katawoka. The descendants of [those who lived in
this hamlet] built a shrine dedicated to the snake, which possessed a
divine nature. [Since that time] there has been a festival observed at
this shrine. {The rest is omitted.}
Northeast of the district office, at Aha Kaha [the old name of the
Naka River], is the posting-station of Kafuchi. There is a unit of the
posting-station on each side of the river. {At one time, the station
was located on a small island in the river, and so it was called the
posting-station of Kafuchi (within the river). { [Although it is no longer
situated in the river], it is still known by the original name.}”
There is a spring south of this posting-station, from which water
flows abundantly. It is called Sarashiwi (bleaching well). Women gather
here to wash and bleach cloth on moonlit nights in summer.” {The

District of Kuji
{East of this district is the Great Sea. On the south and west it is
bordered by the district of Naka. On the north side lie the hills, which
also extend to form the boundary between Michinoku Province and
the district of Taka.}
According to the elders, a small hill to the south of the district
office was named Kuji (whale) by Prince Yamato Takeru because it is
shaped like a whale. {The rest is omitted. }

Fujiwara sent his deputy to supervise his stipend land. The deputy

constructed the dikes to form this reservoir.”
A succession of dells and hills located north of the reservoir is
called Taniahi Yama (joining hills). Large rock formations in this area
are yellow in color and have [trees growing] in their clefts. The area
is populated by monkeys. They gather, stay, and eat there often.”
The village of Kafuchi is located about seven miles northwest of
the district office. This village was formerly called Koko.” {[It is said
by the locals in this area that] Koko is an onomatopoeic word for a
monkey cry.} On the hill east of the village is a rock with a surface
[as smooth as] a mirror. In the remote past, ogres [unruly aborigines]
lived there. They sometimes came to look at their reflections in the
rock mirror. Because they looked at themselves in the mirror, they
gradually became extinct. {According to folklore, even the fiercest
of devils will perish upon viewing its image in a mirror. }8° The mud
of this area, which is blue in color, is used to make a beautiful pigment. {Local people call it awoni (blue pigment) or kakitsuni (colored
mud).} The pigment is obtained and presented to the imperial court
upon request. Koko (here) is the source of what is known as the Kuji

that could weave twill. This is how the place came to be called Shidori
[or Shizuhata, meaning “twill”].*
North of the village is a small river from which gemlike pebbles are
obtained. Their texture resembles that of agate with blue stripes. These
pebbles make good flints. The river is called Tama Gaha [Tamagawa]
because of the gemlike quality of the pebbles obtained there.*?
The village of Yamada is two-thirds of a mile north of the district
office. Most of the land within the village has been reclaimed as rice
fields. Thus, the village is called Yamada (rice field on the hillside) .*4
The river running through [this village] originates in the hills to the
north. It passes south of the district office and joins the Kuji River.
Ayu fish are obtained in abundance there. They are an arm’s length in
size. Along the river is a place called Ihato (rock gate) where a huge
rock formation extends out over the water. Trees grow luxuriantly
atop the rocks, their green leaves rustling with the wind and shuttering
the sun. Beneath the cliff the water runs deep and cool, and white
sand on the shore provides a comfortable respite. On hot summer
days, people seeking cool air gather here from villages near and far.
They sing songs of the Tsukuha melody while drinking the sweet wine
made in the district. Here it is possible to forget one’s troubles.
Another cliff along the river is located in the hamlet of Ohotomo,
in this township. The earth in this area is yellowish. Birds gather
there to peck [worms] from the ground.
Two miles east of the district office is the village of Ohota, which
is the site of the Nagahatabe Shrine. According to the elders, the
forebear of the Nagahatabe family settled in this area and opened a
small weaving shop. His name was Tate, and he claimed to have descended from Kamuhata Hime (the weaving goddess). In the remote

84 The original graph for Yamada (rice paddy on the hill) in this text may have

plausible than Oda.

past, when the Imperial Grandson [Nihigi] came down from heaven,
the weaving goddess followed him and descended to the top of the
ridges called Futakami no Mine of Himuka in Tsukushi. She later
moved from Futakami to Hikitsune Woka in Mino.
Much later, during the reign of Prince Mimaki [posthumously
known as Emperor Sujin], her descendant and the forebear of the
Nagahatabe family, Tate, left Mino and settled in the district of Kuji
where he built a hut and began weaving. In this hut Tate produced
cloth of a magical nature—the cloth made garments by itself. It never
had to be cut or sewn. Tate’s garment cloth was called utsuhata (perfectly woven). According to another version [of the story], the name
utsuhata derived from Tate’s manner of weaving. Tate would shut himself up in his hut while he worked because he was afraid that his
technique would be stolen. Thus, his cloth came to be called utsuhata
(woven in secret). It is said that this cloth was so sturdy that a strong
soldier could not cut the garment with a sharp blade. Even today
people bring silk cloth to this shrine as a yearly gift to the goddess
Kamuhata Hime.
The village of Satsu is north of the village of Ohota. In the past an
unruly Kuzu lived there. He was a Tsuchikumo.** A brave deputy [of
the Yamato Court] named Unakami summoned soldiers and destroyed
this Tsuchikumo and his followers. Afterward, Unakami praised his
campaign, saying, “Blessed is my campaign.” This is how the place
came to be called Satsu (blessed). A kind of white mud obtained in
the hills around this village is used as a white pigment.
There is a high mountain called Mt. Kabire located east of the
village of Satsu. A heavenly deity called Tachihayahiwo is enshrined
there. This god is also known by the name of Hayafuwake. He came
down from heaven and initially resided in the pine branches at Matsusaha [Matsuzawa (pine marsh) ]. The curse of this god was quite severe.
Whenever people excreted facing in the direction of his residence,
the god became angry and cursed their households with sickness.
The residents of the area suffered greatly from this, and they
brought their problem to the Court. The Court sent Katawoka no

Ohomuraji to present offerings to the god. In his prayer of supplication
to the god Tachihayahiwo, Katawoka said, “Since peasants live nearby,
you cannot avoid being defiled at this place. Pray stay away from this
place, so as not to become offended again. You would do better to
take up residence on the clean top of a high mountain.” After listening
to Katawoka’s prayers and supplications, the god Tachihayahiwo moved
to the top of Mt. Kabire.*”
The shrine of this god atop Mt. Kabire is surrounded by stone walls.
Countless families are descended from this deity. Various treasures
are said to have been kept in this shrine. Several rocks are even kept
there as religious relics. These rocks are said to have been transformed
from bows, halberds, pans, and other cooking and serving utensils
belonging to the god Tachihayahiwo. Birds never fly there. It has
been so since ancient times.
At the foot of Mt. Kabire is Satsu no Kaha. Its source is in the hills
north [of this district] from which it flows south to join the Kuji River.
{The rest is omitted.}
About two-thirds of a mile northeast of what is called Takechi is
the village of Mitsuki where there is a spring of clear water. People of
this area call the spring Ohowi (large fountain). The water of this
spring is cold in summer and warm in winter. The water flows out to
form a river. In the hot summer, villagers from far and near gather
here with food and drink. This natural setting provides an ideal spot
for summer festivities.*
South and east of this spring are beaches bordering the Great Sea.
{Abalone, sea urchin, and various kinds of fish and shellfish are abundant there.} North and west of this spring is a stretch of gently rolling
countryside. {Pasania, ichihi, yew, and chestnut grow there. Deer and
wild boar live in [the rolling countryside].} The products of sea and
hills are too numerous to list.

the village of Mitsuki. The original name of the posting-station was

Afuka. According to the elders, this name relates to Prince Yamato
Takeru who at this place met his wife, Princess Great Orange. Thus,
the place was called Afuka [literally, “meeting deer”]. When Councillor Kume was provincial governor of Hitachi, the village was renamed
Sukegaha because salmon are obtained there. {Adult salmon are called
suke in the local dialect. }
District of Taka
{East and south of this district is the Great Sea. On the north and
west are high mountains, which form the boundary between the provinces of Michinoku and Hitachi. }
According to the elders, the name Taka derives from the topographical configuration of this area. Take Misahi was appointed kuni no
miyatsuko of Taka during the reign of Prince Taka Anaho [posthumously
known as Emperor Seimu] who governed the Great Eight Islands.
Seeing the mountains and ridges of this place while on a tour of inspection, Take Misahi named the land Taka (highland). {Take Misahi
was a member of the Izumo no Omi family. [In fact, he was entrusted
with] the area covering the [present-day] district of Taka and the
district of Ihaki [in Michinoku Province]. The folklore [relates the
words] komo makura (pillow made of straw matting) [to the name]
Taka no Kuni (highland). }*
On his [first] tour of this area, Take Misahi designated Suke Gaha
in the district of Kuji as the [southern] boundary of his territory. {It is
about ten miles southwest of the present district office. Today there is
still a village named Michinokuchi (beginning of a territory).} He
designated the hamlet of Kuma as the [northern] boundary of his
territory and called it Michinoshiri (rear half of a territory). [The
hamlet of Kuma now belongs to Michinoku Province.]
Later, in the year of Mizunoto Ushi [653], during the reign of the
emperor [posthumously known as Emperor Kotoku] who governed the
realm from Toyosaki Palace at Nagara in Naniha, [these boundaries

were altered. In that year] the magistrate of the territory, together
with his kinsman, petitioned Councillor Takamuku, the governor general of Azuma. The petition was a request for permission to divide the
territory [delineated by Take Misahi] into two jurisdictions. Their
reasoning was that the original territory was too large, making communication and administration difficult. The persons presenting the
petition were Miyabe of the Ihaki no Atahi family and Shikoaka of
the Miyatsukobe family. Miyabe was the magistrate of Taka and
Shikoaka was his deputy in charge of Ihaki no Kohori.® [The governor
general of Azuma granted their request and] divided the region into
two new districts—Taka and Ihaki. {The district of Ihaki is now under
the jurisdiction of the present-day Michinoku Province. }
There is a hamlet called Akita in the village of Michinokuchi.
According to the elders, Akita was named after [the august words of]
Prince Yamato Takeru. While on an inspection tour of Azuma, the
prince stayed overnight at this place. There, a man had an audience
with the prince, telling him, “There are many deer in this area. [They
are so plentiful that] their protruding antlers look like dry reeds in
the fields, and the vapor from their breath is like the morning mist.”
[The man went on praising the area, saying,] “There are untold numbers of abalones in the sea here. They grow to several feet. Many
other sea products are found here also.”
Prince Yamato Takeru [was intrigued by this man’s description,
and he] decided to stage a hunting and fishing contest between himself and his wife, Princess Great Orange. The prince sent his wife to
fish in the sea, and he went into the hills to hunt. He spent the entire
day in the mountains without seeing so much as a single animal.
Meanwhile, Princess Great Orange caught over a hundred fish in a
short time.
When the contest was over and Prince Yamato Takeru had eaten,
* Thaki no Kohori: The historical significance of the name of this jurisdiction
lies in the fact that the term kohori is expressed by a character in use before the
Taika Reform rather than the one in use after the Taika Reform (see glossary).
Although both are translatable as “district,” a distinction should be made between
the two, since the different characters convey the different stages of central administration as well as the size of the territory. The Ihaki no Kohori in question
became the new Thaki Province in 718.
74 The Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki
he said to his lords-in-waiting, “My wife and I matched our luck.
{Local people call it sachi (luck of catches).} Although I did not
catch anything from the land [and lost the contest], I have enjoyed a
lot of seafood.” Later generations called the place Akita (satiated)
after the prince’s remark.
[At one time] Kuromaro of the Kahara no Sukune family held the
office of provincial governor [of Hitachi]. It was he who had a relief
sculpture of Bodhisattva Kwan-yin carved on the cliffs along the beach
of the Great Sea. The icon still exists. This is how the beach came to
be called Hotoke no Hama (Bodhisattva beach).”!
The posting-station of Meshima is nine miles south of the district
office. On the beach southeast of the posting-station, jewellike pebbles
are found. These are used to play the game of go. In all of Hitachi
Province, it is only on this beach that these beautiful game stones are
found.
[The posting-station of Meshima got its name when Prince Yamato
Takeru visited the area on tour.] When the prince rowed to shore at
this beach, he exclaimed over the many kinds of edible seaweed growing along the shores of the islands in this area, and he named the
place Meshima (seaweed islands). The name has never been altered.
