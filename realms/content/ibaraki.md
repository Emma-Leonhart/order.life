The governor of Hitachi Province reports to the Council of State about matters of the past handed down by the elders. Upon my inquiry into such matters as old tales and traditions, the elders replied as described below.

In ancient times, all the land east of Mount Ashigara in present-day Sagamu Province was referred to by the name Azuma, meaning "east." A part of this territory, which is now Hitachi Province, then consisted of six smaller areas known as districts. These were Nihihari (newly reclaimed), Tsukuha (sticking to leaves), Ubaraki (thorn fortress), Naka (middle), Kuji (whale), and Taka (highland). The Yamato Court appointed a magistrate to administer each of these six areas, drawn from the families of wake (royal descendants) and miyatsuko (local chieftains).

After the Taika Reform, during the reign of Emperor Kotoku, who governed the realm from Toyosaki Palace at Nagara in Naniha, the Court appointed Takamuku no Omi as governor general of Azuma and Nakatomi Hataorita no Muraji as deputy governor general. At that time Azuma was divided into eight provinces, one of which was Hitachi Province.

Hitachi Province is said by some to have been named for the lack of natural barriers within its borders. Its land flows continuously and the roadways are uninterrupted by wide waterways. The districts and communities are separated only by such natural boundaries as dells and rivers. Therefore, the province was named Hitachi, meaning "continuous land."

According to another story related by the elders, the name Hitachi derives from a royal prince's tour of the area. While travelling in the Nihihari area on an inspection tour of the Azuma barbarian land, Prince Yamato Takeru ordered Hinarasu, the chieftain of this area, to dig a new well.

The fresh water collected in the well was clear and prized for drinking. The prince felt that such delightful water deserved the princely blessing, so he stopped his palanquin. As he ladled out some water with his hand the sleeve of his garment got wet. From this the place acquired the name Hitachi, meaning "soaking in water." This episode gave rise to the following folk song:

> Dark cloud
> Hanging round Mount Tsukuha
> In the land of sleeve-soaking
> Hitachi.

Hitachi is a spacious province with far-flung boundaries. Its soil is fertile, awaiting farming. Blessed with resources from both sea and highlands, its residents are self-sufficient and the households affluent. If people labor at tilling and spinning, they soon prosper and avoid poverty. If they want the taste of salt or fish, the sea is at hand on their right, as mountains stand on their left; if they want to plant mulberries or hemp, the terrain is ample to their rear and fore. The whole province is a virtual storehouse of products. It is, indeed, the land of prosperity. What ancient people called Tokoyo, the "eternal world," must have been something like Hitachi.

The only drawback is that the soil does not drain well. Because of this, the soil throughout the province is considered to be of middle rather than superior grade. During a prolonged rainy season, seedlings cannot grow. However, when the summer is dry, crops are generally good.

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Nihihari

East of this district are high mountain ranges, which constitute the boundary between it and the district of Naka. To the south is the district of Shirakabe; the Keno River flows along the west side. On the north lie the hills called Hata no Woka, which mark the boundary between Shimotsu Keno and Hitachi provinces.

According to the elders, during the reign of Emperor Sujin, Hinarasu, the forebear of the chieftain of Nihihari, was sent to pacify the violent barbarians of Azuma. Upon reaching the district of Nihihari, Hinarasu dug a well. The well is still in existence in the village of Nihihari and its site provides the neighboring residents with a festival ground from time to time. The water collected from this well was unusually clear. Thus, this district was named Nihihari, meaning "newly opened," and the name has never changed.

Sixteen miles from the district office is the hamlet of Kasama. The road between the district office and Kasama passes through the hills called Ashiho Yama. According to the elders, a Tsuchikumo female chieftain named Abura Okime lived with her people in these hills. Burial caves in one of the groves in the hamlet of Kasama are known to have sheltered the Tsuchikumo. The existence of these caves gave rise to a folk song:

> If the rumors were too strident,
> I would take you
> Even to the sarcophagus
> In the Wohatsuse Graves to hide;
> Be not worried, my dearest.

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Tsukuha

East of this district is the district of Ubaraki and to the south is the district of Kafuchi. On the west is Keno River; to the north lies Mount Tsukuha.

According to the elders, the land of Tsukuha was once called Ki, meaning "fortress." During the reign of Emperor Sujin, a man named Tsukuha was appointed chieftain of this area. Tsukuha was a kinsman of the Uneme no Omi family, who were placed in charge of the tributary women presented by local chieftains to the Yamato ruler. At the time of his appointment, Tsukuha said, "I will name this land after myself so that my name will be remembered generation after generation." So he discarded the original name Ki and adopted the name Tsukuha for the district.

According to the elders, in the remote past, a Japanese ancestral deity was travelling around visiting his descendants. As he rounded Mount Fuji, in the Suruga region, the sun was setting. So the ancestral deity asked the goddess of Mount Fuji for overnight shelter. This goddess was the child of the ancestral deity.

The goddess of Mount Fuji, however, was reluctant to extend hospitality to the visiting deity. "We are now observing a period of abstinence for the new crops," she said. "During this time custom forbids us to entertain outsiders in our households. We cannot comply with your wish. Pray forgive us."

The ancestral deity, who was both disappointed and furious, violently denounced the goddess of Mount Fuji and all her household. "What do I hear?" asked the visitor god. "How could you not let me stay? I am your father," he cried. "May my curse hereafter fall upon you; may the snow fall and cover you at all times; may you suffer from the bitterest cold; may no one ever climb to visit you; and may no offerings be given to you ever."

Thus turned away, the ancestral deity went to Mount Tsukuha and asked to stay the night. The goddess of Mount Tsukuha answered, "Though we are observing a ceremonial period for the new crops, we shall obey your will, my lord." The goddess of Mount Tsukuha ordered food to be brought in and respectfully attended to the deity's needs.

The ancestral deity was pleased, and said, "How lovable my descendant is; how lofty her shrine stands! As heaven and earth would prosper forever, and as sun and moon would shine forever, may her domain prosper forever. May her people gather here to celebrate the good harvest every year."

Because of the ancestral god's curse, Mount Fuji has always been covered with snow and is inaccessible. Mount Tsukuha, on the contrary, has always been accessible. Folks have continued to come here, gather together, sing, dance, eat, and drink without ceasing.

Mount Tsukuha has two distinct crests. The western peak, called Male, is craggy and precipitous, standing high above the drifting clouds. The eastern peak, called Female, is easier to climb, though not without encountering rocks and stones along the way. On this peak there is a spring from which water flows constantly. Men and women from all over Azuma gather there every spring and autumn. Some come on foot, others on horseback. All come in groups, bringing food and drink, and enjoy festive nights there. These gatherings occur in the spring, when the flowers are blooming, and in autumn, when the leaves are turning red. A local folk song says:

> "Why not gather together
> At the festive night at Tsukuha."
> The one so promised me must have gone
> with someone else but me,
> Since I sat up alone all night long.

Another folk song goes:

> Staying all alone
> At the festive night
> Of Tsukuha,
> Without my sweetheart;
> How I long for daybreak!

There are many such songs, far too numerous to list here. According to the local folklore, if the girls did not receive token gifts from the boys at this popular gathering, requesting their further association, their parents would not consider their daughters to be women.

Three miles west of the district office lies Toba no Afumi, a broad shoal about 3.3 miles long and 1.6 miles wide. East of this shoal is the district office of Tsukuha and to the south is Keno River. The west and north sides border on the district of Nihihari, and the district of Shirakabe is on the northeast.

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Shida

East of this district is Shida no Umi, the Shida inlet, and to the south is Enoura no Umi. Keno River forms the western boundary; to the north lies the district of Kafuchi.

Three miles north of the district office there is a well known as Usuwi. According to the elders, when Emperor Keiko set up camp on Ukishima, the floating island, there was no drinking water. Therefore, the prince sent for a water diviner and let him divine the site. The well was dug. This well is still in existence in the hamlet of Wokuri.

West of this well is the village of Takaku. According to the elders, in the remote past, at the beginning of heaven and earth, when even the plants could talk -- an expression the ancients used to emphasize a time before the realm was under the full control of any central authority -- the god Futsunushi descended from high heaven to make an inspection tour of the Middle Land of the Reed Field, the Japanese islands. This god pacified the unruly in the mountains and valleys of the Middle Land.

When he had subjugated all the unruly people and was planning to return to high heaven, the god Futsunushi removed his august belongings from his person and left them here in the village of Takaku before he ascended into high heaven riding on a white cloud. These items were his armor, halberd, shield, sword, and a string of jewels.

The inhabitants say that venison obtained in the swamps of this area tastes stale, not quite as good as the meat of deer caught in the dry land. In any case, there are so many deer in the area that they remain plentiful, despite the large-scale deer hunts conducted by residents from both Shimotsufusa and Hitachi provinces.

West of the village is Ihina Shrine. The presiding deity at this shrine is related to the god Ihina who resides in Mount Tsukuha.

Enoura no Tsu, the harbor of Enoura, has a posting-station. This is the terminus of the Great Eastern Sea Route and the beginning of the Hitachi Road. In olden days, travellers on this road would have to take a ferry at the tip of Miura Peninsula to reach Hitachi Province, hence the designation "eastern sea route." When official messengers come to this province, they first must wash their mouths and hands in honor of the Great God of Kashima who resides in the district of Kashima, east of Enoura. Only then may the messengers proceed farther into the province.

According to the elders, Prince Yamato Takeru once toured the shore of Shida no Umi as far as the place called Norihama, where he saw large quantities of edible seaweed called nori drying on the beach. That is why the village was named Norihama, meaning "seaweed beach."

There is a hamlet called Ukishima, the floating island, east of the village of Norihama. It is about two miles long and half a mile wide. It is surrounded by water; its terrain is a mixture of hills and fields. There are fifteen households on the island. The tillable land amounts to only about nineteen acres. Those who live on this island make their living by producing salt from sea water. Nine shrines are found there. The islanders exercise moderation in both speech and action.

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Ubaraki

East of this district is the district of Kashima, and to the south is Saga no Nagareumi, an inlet or estuary. West of this district lies Mount Tsukuha; on the north is the district of Naka.

According to the elders, in the past this area was inhabited by two native groups known as Kuzu -- a name derived from kunisu, meaning "master of the land" -- called Yama no Saheki and No no Saheki. These creatures dug caves all around the area and lived in them. At the approach of people, they would hide deep in the caves, coming out and wandering the fields only when the people had left. Their nature was like that of wolves and night owls, spying and stealing. They would never reconcile themselves with a civilized approach.

Kurosaka, a member of the Oho no Omi family, devised a scheme to exterminate the Kuzu. While they were away in the fields, Kurosaka had his men place thorn branches in their caves. He then ordered his horsemen to charge them in the fields. In great excitement, the recalcitrants rushed to their caverns but the thorn branches barred their way and all were fatally wounded. Because of this, the word meaning thorns, ubara, was adopted as the name of this district.

According to another story, Yama no Saheki and No no Saheki became chiefs of the bandits and indulged in plundering and killing good people. In an effort to exterminate them, Kurosaka constructed a fortress made of thorn branches. This is why the area was named Ubaraki, meaning "fortress of thorny branches."

A river runs southwest of the Ubaraki district office. It is called Shizuku no Kaha. It originates on Mount Tsukuha, flows down from west to east, and penetrates the middle of the district where it empties into the beach called Takahama.

Takahama is a place people visit in the spring and fall. They come by land and sea. In springtime, the shore is decorated with flowers of a thousand hues. In autumn, the banks are adorned with leaves of a hundred colors. Warblers sing out from the field behind the beach and graceful cranes wade in the shallows. Lads and lasses from the farms and fishing villages throng the beach in droves; vendors and farmers arrive and depart in small boats. How much more so in the summer months! The crowd gathers in the sizzling morning and roasting evening, together with their companions and servants. They pass the humid days sitting on the beach gazing into the water, lost in their daydreams and thoughts. As the evening wind brings rustling tides, those who avoid the heat can forget troublesome worries; as the shadows of the surrounding hills grow long, the cool air soothes the throng with relief. A poem composed at one of these gatherings says:

> The rolling waves
> On the beach of Takahama:
> Even though the throng would come from afar,
> I would not go with them,
> If I once rendered you my heart.

Another poem reads:

> At the rustling wind
> At the lower beach of Takahama,
> My heart yearns for the girl
> Whom I wish to embrace;
> But alas, she called me "ugly fellow!"

There is a knoll called Kuhahara three miles east of the district office. In the remote past, when he stopped on top of this small hill for a meal, Prince Yamato Takeru ordered his water-bearers to dig a new well. The water poured clear and fragrant from the new well. There was no doubt that it was drinking water of superb quality, and the prince said, "How pure is the water collected here!" This is how the village of Tamari received its name.

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Namekata

The east, south, and west sides of this district are surrounded by lakes. On the north is the district of Ubaraki.

According to the elders, in the year 653, during the reign of Emperor Kotoku, two magistrates of this region petitioned Councillor Takamuku, who was the governor general of Azuma, to create a new district by relocating eight villages from the jurisdiction of Ubaraki and seven villages from the territory of Naka. Altogether, there were more than seven hundred households in these fifteen villages. The petition was granted and the new district established. This was the district of Namekata. A district office was built accordingly.

The district of Namekata was named after a comment made by Prince Yamato Takeru while he was on a military campaign in the vicinity. After pacifying the region north of the lake, the prince came to this area. He stopped at the spring of Tsukino, the zelkova field, and while washing his hands he intentionally dropped one of his jewels into the water to bless the spring -- a symbolic means of claiming sovereignty. The spring is still in existence in the village of Namekata. It is called Tama no Shimizu, the "clear water of the jewelled spring."

Resuming his journey, Prince Yamato Takeru arrived at Arahara no Woka where he had his meal. After looking about him in all four directions, the prince turned to his lords-in-waiting, and said, "I caused my palanquin to stop here so that I could take a stroll. As I gaze into the distance from the top of this hill, this land is extremely appealing. Clouds circle above the ridges of the mountains, while mists are creeping through the dells and valleys below. The configuration of this land is both extraordinary and beautiful. It is fitting to call it namekuhashi, scenic land." Later, people began calling this district Namekata.

The site from which Prince Yamato Takeru viewed the four corners of this land is a plateau called Arahara. Descending from this plateau, the prince came to Ohoya River where he took a boat up the river. When he reached the middle of the river the rudder broke. Ohoya River was therefore renamed the Kajinashi River, the "rudderless river." The river is the boundary between the districts of Ubaraki and Namekata. The many kinds of fish, such as silver carp, obtained from this river are too numerous to be listed in total.

When he had proceeded further toward the border, Prince Yamato Takeru saw a wild duck in the sky, and he shot it with an arrow. The bird fell to the ground. The place where the bird fell was named Kamono, meaning "Kamo field." The condition of the soil in this place is such that no plants grow there. North of there, however, there are virgin woods where trees grow luxuriantly. These are the oak, maple, and cypress. In the woods there is a rectangular pond. This is actually an irrigation reservoir built by the people of the area during the term of office of the governor general of Azuma, Takamuku no Omi. North of the reservoir there is a branch shrine of the god of Katori. The soil around this shrine is fertile and plants grow there in abundance.

West of the district office is a ferry used for crossing Namekata no Umi. In the lake grows miru, a small edible seaweed, and a kind of seaweed from which salt can be obtained after burning. The various types of fish obtained from this lake are too numerous to be listed. Only whales have never been seen in this lake.

There is a grove east of the district office. A shrine of the local deity is located in this grove. A cold spring in the grove serves as a meeting place for the local people who gather here to draw water and drink. The spring is called Ohowi, the "large well."

There is a large zelkova tree south of the district office. Its northern branches trail to the ground and the top grows as if it is trying to reach the sky. There once was a marsh near this tree. Even today, in a prolonged rainy season, the courtyard of the district office becomes flooded. There are a few orange trees growing in the courtyard.

Northwest of the district office is the village of Tega. Long ago, a chieftain named Tega lived there, and the village was named after him. North of this village there is a branch shrine of the Great God of Kashima. The soil of the hills and fields around this shrine is fertile. Pasania, chestnut, bamboo, and miscanthus grow abundantly there.

North of this shrine is the hamlet of Sone. Here, too, there lived a chieftain named Sonehiko. The village is still named after him. Today, a posting-station is situated there. It is called the posting-station of Sone.

According to the elders, during the reign of Emperor Keitai, who governed the realm from Tamaho Palace at Ihare, there was a man called Matachi of the Yahazu family. Matachi planned to reclaim the valley filled with miscanthus west of the district office. His rice-farming scheme was disrupted, however, by a plague of snakes. People of this area refer to all snakes as yatsu no kami, meaning "valley gods." The snakes that disturbed Matachi's reclamation project are said to have had horns. The local people believed that when fleeing from the snake, they must never look back. Anyone who turned his face to the snakes would suffer a curse upon his household -- he and his entire family would perish, leaving no descendants. Even today, snakes are numerous in the vicinity of the district office.

Matachi, outraged by the sudden appearance of the snakes, armed himself against them. Taking up his halberd, he slew several, and the rest retreated to the foot of the hill on the east. Matachi then thrust a long cane into the irrigation ditch to mark his territory, and said to the snakes, "The land extending from this place to the hill is your territory. The land extending from this landmark to the valley, however, is mine, and it is reserved for my people's farming. Do not violate this boundary. Be not resentful of this decision, for I shall construct a shrine for you and serve as the priest there. My descendants will respectfully provide you with offerings." Thereupon Matachi erected a shrine to consecrate the spirits of the serpents. He then reclaimed about twenty-four acres of rice field for the upkeep of the shrine. His family has retained the priestship of this shrine ever since.

Later, during the reign of Emperor Kotoku, this valley was occupied by Mibu no Muraji Maro. Maro constructed an embankment around the irrigation ditch there. At that time, the same kind of snakes again massed together in the pasania trees beside the irrigation ditch. Time passed, and the reptiles showed no sign of evacuating the treetops. Realizing that the snakes were not going to leave, Maro proclaimed in a loud voice, "This irrigation ditch is here to aid my people. Who are you to disregard this aim?" Presently he issued an order to the laborers: "Kill all the insects and animals, wherever you see them. Don't be afraid, and show them no mercy." When Maro finished his declaration, the vicious snakes disappeared. Today, this ditch is called Shihiwi no Ike, the "pond by the pasania well." Pasania trees grow around the irrigation ditch, and a well nearby yields fresh water. This well is located on the highway leading to Kashima.

There is a village 2.3 miles south of the district office. This is the village of Wotaka, named after an unruly chieftain who lived in this area in the remote past. In this village, on the east side of the highway, is a pond, which was constructed by Councillor Tagima while he was serving as the provincial governor. A large number of monkeys and wild boar live on the hill west of the pond. Plants are also abundant on this hill.

South of the pond is another small hill called Kujira Woka, meaning "whale hill." Long ago, a whale crawled up the hill and lay down there, and so the place came to be called Kujira Woka. Beside this hill is a pond called Kuriya no Ike, the "chestnut-house pond." The nuts of the chestnut trees around this pond grow so big that the pond came to be known by that name. Nearby is another branch shrine of the god of Katori.

In the village of Asafu, wild hemp once grew abundantly beside the marsh that surrounds the area. The stem of the hemp was as thick as bamboo and it grew to a height of approximately ten feet. The hills around this village are populated with monkeys and wild boar. Pasania, chestnut, zelkova, and oak trees also grow in these hills. During the reign of Emperor Tenmu, who governed the realm from Kiyomihara Palace in Asuka, Wokoro of the Takerube family in the village of Ohofu caught some wild horses fit for riding in this field and presented them to the central court. They were what are known as Namekata horses, although some people mistakenly refer to them as Ubaraki horses.

Six miles south of the district office is the village of Kasumi. According to ancient tradition, Emperor Keiko climbed to the top of Tomi no Woka, the Tomi Plateau, in Inami in the land of Shimotsufusa. He strolled around, gazing at the panoramic view. Looking to the east, the prince exclaimed to his lords-in-waiting, "Blue waves are rising and falling in the sea, and a pink mist is creeping over the land. How beautiful is the land I now behold in the mist!" As a result of these princely remarks, the people named the area Kasumi, meaning "mist."

There is a shrine on a hill east of the village of Kasumi. Elm, zelkova, camellia, pasania, bamboo, arrow-shaft bamboo, and snakesbeard grow abundantly on this hill. A sandbar can be seen in the lake west of this village. This is Nihihari no Su, the "Nihihari shallow." The place is so named because one can see Mount Tsukuha in the land of Nihihari from that sandbar.

Three miles from the village of Kasumi is the hamlet of Itaku. This hamlet, which is located near Namekata no Umi, comprises the posting-station of Itaku. West of the posting-station is a grove of elm. This grove is the place to which Prince Womi was exiled during the reign of Emperor Tenmu. Abundantly obtainable in the lake are two kinds of seaweed: one used for salt making and another called miru. Also obtainable are round clam, mud snail, and clam.

According to the elders, Emperor Sujin sent Take Kashima, the forebear of the chieftain of Naka, to suppress the unruly rascals of the eastern hinterland.

Take Kashima and his soldiers crushed a large number of rebels and subsequently arrived at Aba no Shima, Aba Island, where they were to take shelter overnight. While reconnoitering the surrounding vistas, Take Kashima noticed smoke rising in the east. Suspecting that there might be people living there, he and his troops were alerted. He looked to the sky and prayed to the heavenly deities, "If the smoke be that of friends, may it drift toward us. If it be the smoke of our enemies, may it disappear over the sea." The smoke thereupon floated toward the sea, betraying the presence of an enemy.

There were in fact two Kuzu who had made themselves leaders of the recalcitrants in that area. These were Yasakashi and Yatsukushi. Together with their followers, they dug into the ground, built bunkers, and lived in them. They spied on the imperial troops, and thus remained secure. Whenever they showed themselves and Take Kashima released his men to pursue them, the recalcitrants would flee to their bunkers, shut the gates, and defend themselves.

Presently, Take Kashima formed a grand scheme to eradicate the recalcitrants from both land and sea. First, he selected soldiers willing to die, and placed them in the recesses of the hills. There the warriors equipped themselves with tools and weapons to destroy the enemy. Second, Take Kashima ordered his other men to walk in a splendid procession on the beach and put the boats and rafts into the water. In the water these rafts and boats were tied together side by side, forming a makeshift stage for dancing. Canopies overhung the stage like floating clouds, their colors waving in dazzling hues. The tunes of flutes and zithers harmonized with the sound of the waves. Thus, the soldiers performed the Kishima dance, a native dance-song of northern Kyushu, for seven days and nights.

Observing this unusual performance of music and dancing, all the rebels came down to the shore. While the enemy was thus carried away by the fantasy at the shore, Take Kashima had his cavalry close the gates of the enemy stronghold and attack them from the rear. All members of the band were taken prisoner or burned to death at once.

At the time there was widespread comment on this carnage -- comments such as itaku korosu, meaning "to kill relentlessly," and futsu ni kiru, meaning "to slay all indiscriminately." The township of Itaku and the hamlet of Futsuna trace their names to these expressions. Two other places also were named after the hearsay concerning this massacre: the village of Yasukiri, meaning "to kill easily," and the hamlet of Esaki, meaning "to split skillfully."

There is a shallow area in the water south of Itaku, covering about a square mile. In springtime people from the districts of Kashima and Namekata go there to gather clams and other shellfish.

About four and a half miles from the district office is the village of Tagima. According to the elders, this village was named after the poor road conditions in its vicinity. When Prince Yamato Takeru visited this area on a hunting trip, a chieftain named Torihiko was living there. Because this chieftain would not submit to Prince Yamato Takeru, the prince schemed against him and killed him.

Afterward the prince returned to his camp, which was at Yakatano. To reach the camp he and his troops had to follow a very narrow and rugged road. Because of the bad road, the area was named Tagima, meaning "rugged area." In the local dialect, people say tagitagishi, meaning "rugged." Although the soil is very poor in this field, the gromwell plant grows there. There are two branch shrines of the great gods of Kashima and Katori in this village. Oak, chestnut, and other trees grow in the groves surrounding the village. A large number of wild boar, monkeys, and wolves also live there.

South of the village of Tagima is the village of Kitsu. In the remote past, two Kuzu chieftains named Kitsuhiko and Kitsuhime dwelled there. Kitsuhiko did not recognize the royal authorities and disobeyed an august command issued by Prince Yamato Takeru when he passed through the area. The prince therefore slew the man with his mighty sword. This action so frightened the female chief, Kitsuhime, that she raised a white flag to signal her surrender and prostrated herself on the road before the prince. The prince granted her amnesty and released her followers.

Kitsuhime was so grateful to the prince that she served him wholeheartedly as he proceeded to his camp at Wonukino. There Kitsuhime and her sisters waited upon him hand and foot, supplying all his needs. Wind and rain did not faze Kitsuhime. She never failed to serve the prince under any circumstances. Prince Yamato Takeru was very touched by her loyalty, and came to feel affection toward the women. This is how Wonukino alternately came to be called Uruhashi no Wono, meaning "lovely small field" or "small field of loving."

South of Wonukino is the village called Ta no Sato. During the reign of Empress Jingu, a man named Kotsuhiko lived in this area. He served as emissary to Korea three times during his life, and because of his service the princess granted him rice fields in this area. This is why the village is called Ta no Sato, the "village of the rice field."

In this area there is also a field called Hatsumu. It was named after a deed of Prince Yamato Takeru. While spending the night here, the prince repaired the edges of his bow and restrung it. This is how the field came to be called Hatsumu no No, the "bow-edge field." On the shore of the lake north of Hatsumu no No there is a branch shrine of the Great God of Kashima. The condition of the soil is poor. Only a few scattered oak, elm, and bamboo grow there.

South of Ta no Sato are the villages of Afuka and Ohofu. According to the elders, the origins of both place names are related to Prince Yamato Takeru. When the prince was staying at a temporary palace at Wokazaki, in Afuka, he had his dining hut constructed at the water's edge. He would travel back and forth between the dining hut and his living quarters by walking over boats tied together to form a sort of pontoon bridge. The present-day name Ohofu is traceable to the name of the prince's dining hut, Ohohi, meaning "grand meal." Afuka was named after the meeting of Prince Yamato Takeru with his wife Princess Oho Tachibana, known as Princess Great Orange, who came down from Yamato to visit him. They met here and thus the place came to be called Afuka, meaning "meeting."

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Kashima

East of this district is the Great Sea. To the south is Aze no Minato, a waterway which forms the boundary between Shimotsufusa and Hitachi provinces. On the west is a lake. To the north is Atakana no Minato, which forms the boundary between the districts of Naka and Kashima.

According to the elders, in the year 649, during the reign of Emperor Kotoku, two officials of the Nakatomi family petitioned Councillor Takamuku, the governor general of Azuma, to establish a new district in honor of the Great God of Kashima.

Councillor Takamuku therefore ordered that one village south of Karuno in the former territory of Unakami be designated for this purpose. Likewise, Councillor Takamuku commanded that five villages north of Samuta in the old territory of Naka be designated as well. The new district established from these six villages was named Kashima and it was dedicated to the Great God of Kashima.

Today there are three shrines dedicated to this god. They are the Heavenly Great Shrine of Kashima, Sakato Shrine, and Numawo Shrine. The Great God of Kashima is also known by the name Heavenly Great God of Kashima.

In the remote past, hegemony was not yet established by the royal family in Yamato, and the distinction between high heaven and earth was not clear. The ancestral deities who produced the rulers of Japan wished to correct this situation and establish hegemony. Therefore, the ancestral deities -- referred to locally as kamiromi, the goddesses, and kamirogi, the gods -- called a meeting of a multitude of gods.

At the meeting in the Plain of High Heaven the ancestral deities named the Japanese Islands Toyo Ashihara no Mizuho no Kuni, meaning "the land of beautiful reed plains," and decreed that this land would be governed by the imperial grandson, Prince Ninigi.

In order to fulfill this prophecy, the parental deities dispatched the Great God of Kashima to herald the coming of their grandson. The heavenly gods called the palace of this herald deity Hi no Kashima, the "shining palace of Kashima," whereas before it was customarily called the Toyo Kashima, the "palace of Kashima the bounteous."

According to the oral traditions of this area, when the ancestral deities entrusted this world to their grandson Ninigi by decree, the land was filled with unruly spirits, the araburu kami tachi. The unruly spirits were everywhere. Even rocks and plants were believed to possess prophetic natures. The world was as obnoxious as flies in early summer. Furthermore, vicious creatures were everywhere as apparent as a fire glowing in the night. The Great God of Kashima came down from high heaven to rectify this situation.

Later, during the reign of Emperor Sujin, several offerings were presented to this meritorious Great God of Kashima. The offerings consisted mainly of instruments of war, including ten swords, two spears, two iron bows, two iron arrows, four quivers, a tool made of cast iron, a sheet of steel, a horse, a saddle, two mirrors, and bundles of coarse silk in five different colors: blue, yellow, red, white, and black.

According to the local traditions, the Great God of Kashima once appeared to Emperor Sujin. When the emperor was in Yamato, he saw a figure clad in a white robe standing on top of Mount Ohosaka. The white figure carried a white spear, and said, "Worship me in the proper manner and I will stand by thy side. I shall cause thee to rule whatever territories thou desirest to govern." The emperor hastily summoned his favorites to consult with them on the matter. Among them was Kikikatsu, "Wise Listener," of the great Nakatomi family, who advised, "This is the god's pronouncement. He is the Great God of Kashima. He appeared in order to remind you that you are the one to whom the ancestral deities entrusted the rule of these Great Eight Islands." Emperor Sujin was awed at hearing this and presented the above-mentioned offerings to the shrine of the Great God of Kashima.

There are sixty-five shrine households assigned to Kashima Shrine. In the beginning there were only eight households serving this shrine. Fifty more were added during the reign of Emperor Kotoku. During the reign of Emperor Tenmu, nine more households joined them, making a total of sixty-seven. Later, in the year 690, at the time of another regrouping, two households were redesignated, leaving sixty-five shrine households.

It was during the reign of Emperor Tenji, who held his court at Ohotsu in Afumi, that an emissary was sent to erect a large shrine dedicated to the Great God of Kashima. Since then, the reconstruction or repair of this shrine has been carried out by imperial craftsmen.

Every year in the seventh month there is a festival during which large boats are built and dedicated to Tsu no Miya, the branch shrine of the Great God of Kashima located on the beach that faces the lake. According to the elders, this custom of the boat dedication began during the reign of Prince Yamato Takeru. One day the Great God of Kashima said to Sayama of the Nakatomi family, "You shall hereafter be placed in charge of my divine boats." Sayama answered, "I shall respectfully obey your command. I dare not decline this commission."

The following morning the Great God of Kashima again appeared to Sayama, saying, "I placed your boats in the lake." Sayama looked at the lake. The boats were not in the water but on top of a hill beside it.

Sometime later, the Great God of Kashima said to Sayama, "The boats are now on the hill." Looking at the hill, Sayama saw that the boats were not there but had been placed in the lake. After many similar experiences, Sayama came to dread the god's pronouncements. He therefore constructed three boats -- each about twenty feet in length -- and for the first time dedicated them to the use of the Great God of Kashima. This is how the festival of the boats came to be associated with this branch shrine.

The festival of the Kashima Shrine is celebrated by the Urabe, the diviner family, on the tenth day of the fourth month every year. The members of the Urabe and their associates gather at the shrine to observe this festival. Day and night they enjoy drinking and dancing. This is one of their songs:

> This new wine
> Of the god,
> You made me drink --
> I am beside myself,
> Hence.

The people of the Urabe who belong to this shrine live in the vicinity, which is located on a plateau overlooking the Great Sea in the east and the lake in the west. Peasant dwellings dot the adjacent hills and dells.

The natural configuration of this area is nearly ideal. Trees and grasses grow so thick and high that they form natural fences and walls. Even the houses on the high ridges are protected from wind by the surrounding pine trees and clumps of bamboo. The place is blessed with abundant water. Many brooks and springs are found nestled between the knolls and dells. People living up in the hills can always dig deep wells for good water. Vines cover the walls of these wells. In the springtime there is an unforgettable fragrance from the various flowers in bloom. In the autumn one cannot help but admire the brocade of the leaves. It is as though this is the territory of invisible gods and the land of hermits. Its beauty cannot be described by the human tongue.

South of the Kashima Shrine is the district office. North of the shrine is a marsh called Numawo, the "marsh tail." If we are to believe the stories told by the elders, this is the marsh whose water ran down from high heaven in the remote past. Edible lotus roots are obtained from this marsh -- a plant the Japanese still consider a delicacy, and which was believed by Taoist tradition to grant long life. Their taste is superb. No lotus roots obtained elsewhere can match those obtained here. The lotus roots from this marsh are also used for medicinal purposes. Carp and silver carp live in the marsh.

The district office was formerly located near this marsh. Numerous orange trees now growing on the site bear delicious fruit.

Less than a mile east of the present district office is the popular Takahama Beach. On the beach is a shell mound composed of sand and shells from the Great Sea. Pine groves cover the mound. Pasania and oak also grow on the mound. Spring water flows under the pine trees. The spring is located on the southeastern part of this beach. It is about fifty feet in circumference. Clear water is always obtainable there.

As one proceeds farther down the beach to the southeast, passing a series of pine groves, the name changes to Wakamatsu Beach. Iron ore is obtainable there. In the first year of Kyoun, in 704, the provincial governor of Hitachi directed the blacksmith Ohomaro of the Sahi family to make swords from iron ore obtained at Wakamatsu Beach. The pine groves stretch about ten miles between the Takahama and Wakamatsu beaches, the latter of which belongs to the village of Karuno. China root is found in these woods every year.

At the south end of Wakamatsu Beach is a place called Wakamatsu no Ura, or Wakamatsu harbor. It is located north of Aze no Minato, the waterway which forms the boundary between Shimotsufusa and Hitachi provinces. Iron sand from the area around Aze no Minato produces unusually sharp swords. However, one cannot simply go there and cut trees or collect sand at will, because the area is within the territory belonging to the Kashima Shrine.

The village of Hama is located six miles south of the district office. The pine groves that cover its eastern side enclose a large marsh. This is called Samuta, and it is about a mile and a half in circumference. Carp and silver carp are obtained there.

The rice paddies in the villages of Shima and Karuno are rather wet. The wreckage of a large ship has washed ashore on the beach east of the village of Karuno. The beach is on the Great Sea. The ship is about forty-seven yards long and thirty yards wide. It is decayed and buried in the sand. It is said to be the hulk of a ship built at the order of Emperor Tenji, who had the shipwrights at Ihaki of Michinoku Province build a large ship to be used for a survey of the frontier. The ship was wrecked en route and drifted to shore here. The Hitachi Fudoki is the only extant document of the period that speaks of this enterprise in the far north.

According to tradition, there is a love story about the Unawi no Matsuhara, the "pine grove of young lovers," on the southern part of this beach. The boy was from Samuta and the girl was from Aze. Their beauty was well known among the villagers. The boy and girl lived some distance apart and thus they knew of each other only through the village's rumors about their beauty. They yearned to meet, and their yearning turned to burning desire.

After many months, they met one day by chance at the regional songfest, which local people call utagaki or kagahi. The boy composed a poem for the girl:

> To the twig of the small branch of pine,
> Having tied a charm strip firm;
> You must have been pining for me,
> Oh, lovely girl from Aze.
> I will dance with you.

The girl replied:

> Though mingled with
> The multitude I am,
> You have singled me out already,
> Have you not, my love?
> Look at you, so hastily running toward me!

Having finally met, the sweethearts wished only to be alone in each other's arms, and they declared their love. In fear of being discovered by the others, they took shelter among the pine trees some distance from the crowd. There they sat hand in hand, knee to knee, telling each other of their long-restrained yearning. The waiting was over and new joys were welcoming them.

The autumn night was beautiful. Cool breezes brushed their bodies. Cranes could be seen landing here and there on the moonlit beach. The voices of wild geese in the mountains blended with the whispering pines overhead. There were no other sounds. In the hills even the spring water ran soundlessly over the rocks. As the serene night wore on, a mist rose to cover the land. The lovers' fancies saw multicolored leaves flutter about nearby and heard sapphire waves roar on the distant beach. They experienced that night the utmost happiness and rapture. Speaking honeyed words, the two were oblivious to the approach of daybreak.

They were suddenly awakened by the cockcrow. As dawn came, dogs began to bark. The young lovers did not know what to do in the daylight. They were so terrified of being seen by the villagers that they wished only to become pine trees. The Great God of Kashima must have felt merciful, for he transformed the couple into two pine trees. The lad became a pine called Namimatsu, meaning "behold me not," and the lass became a pine called Kotsumatsu, meaning "cut me not" -- though kotsu can also mean "yearning," hence the "yearning pine." These names have never been altered.

The village of Shirotori is located ten miles north of the district office. According to the elders, the name of the village originated from an episode that occurred during the reign of Emperor Suinin. One day the villagers noticed white birds flying overhead. Strangely, upon landing the birds turned into young girls. As maidens, during the day they gathered rocks and pebbles, which they piled up to form dikes. Each evening they would again become white birds and fly away, always returning the following morning to work as maidens. But, as fast as the maidens worked, the rocks were always washed away by the action of the waves. Days passed with little progress on the dikes, and the maidens of the white birds began to sing this song:

> With wings the white birds
> Piled rocks up high;
> But alas, they are all washed away!
> White wings, too,
> Have tired and broken!

Finally, singing this song, the white birds flew away and never returned. This is why the village was named Shirotori, meaning "white birds."

South of the village of Shirotori is Tsunowore Beach. According to local tradition, a huge serpent lived in this area long ago. The animal wanted to reach the Great Sea, so it tried to dig a tunnel under the beach. The serpent broke his horn while digging, and so the place was named Tsunowore, meaning "horn-breaking."

According to another version, the etymology is related to Prince Yamato Takeru. When the prince was staying at this place, there was no drinking water for him to enjoy with his meal. His servants dug a well using the antlers of deer, and some of the antlers broke during the digging. This is why the place came to be called Tsunowore.

## District of Naka

East of this district is the Great Sea. On the south are the districts of Kashima and Ubaraki. Bordering on the west is a large mountain, which forms the boundary between the district of Nihihari and Shimotsu Keno Province. To the north is the district of Kuji.

There is a hill about half a mile west of the posting-station of Hiratsu. This hill is called Ohokushi. In the remote past, there was a giant with arms so long that while sitting far inland he could reach all the way to the beach and dig clams at the seashore. After eating the clams, the giant would throw the shells in a pile. Eventually so many shells accumulated that the pile became a hill. So the people named the hill after the giant's monumental feat of clam digging. The present-day name, Ohokushi, derives from Ohokujiri, meaning "grand digging."

The giant's footprint was sixty yards long and forty yards wide. When he urinated, it made a huge hole forty yards in diameter.

There is a hill called Kurefushi Yama north of the village of Ubaraki. According to the elders, a brother and sister once lived in this village. The brother was Nukahiko and the sister was Nukahime. One night while the sister was in a sleeping chamber alone, a man whose name is unknown approached her. His nightly visits continued. Each evening the man would come to court the girl, always leaving her the following day, and finally Nukahime agreed to become his wife. One night she became pregnant.

When her time of delivery came, Nukahime gave birth to a small snake. The baby snake would not talk during the daytime, and would talk to his mother only at night. Surprised and awed, the mother and her brother grew to believe that this was the child of a god. They placed it in a clean bowl and set it on a raised altar in their home. Overnight the baby snake grew as large as the bowl. The mother and her brother transferred it to a larger vessel, and again the snake grew to fill the vessel overnight.

Every day Nukahiko and Nukahime moved the snake to a larger vessel until eventually they had used all the bowls and vessels in the house. At this point, Nukahime, the mother, said, "From the speed with which you grow it is obvious that you are not an ordinary snake but a child of divine nature. In our current circumstances, we can no longer afford to raise you. Pray go to your father's place. Remain at our place no longer."

The snake-child was saddened by his mother's pronouncement. But when he dried his tears, he said, "I shall respectfully obey your command. I dare not go against your will, Mother." Then he continued, "But now I am all alone. I have no one to go with me. Pray take pity on me, Mother. Give me one attendant to care for me."

Nukahime replied, "As you can see, in this household there is no one but your mother and uncle. No one can go with you. It would be beyond our means, my son."

The baby snake, who resented his mother's words, became indignant and speechless. Revealing his true mood, as he was about to leave he shook his uncle with great force, killing him. In alarm, the mother threw a tray at the child. The snake lost its power to ascend. Unable to rise, it turned into a hill.

The vessels and jars in which the snake was raised are preserved in the hamlet of Katawoka. The descendants of those who lived in this hamlet built a shrine dedicated to the snake, which possessed a divine nature. Since that time there has been a festival observed at this shrine.

Northeast of the district office, at Aha Kaha, the old name of the Naka River, is the posting-station of Kafuchi. There is a unit of the posting-station on each side of the river. At one time, the station was located on a small island in the river, and so it was called the posting-station of Kafuchi, meaning "within the river." Although it is no longer situated in the river, it is still known by the original name. This place is now in the vicinity of Mito, the present-day capital of Ibaraki Prefecture.

There is a spring south of this posting-station, from which water flows abundantly. It is called Sarashiwi, the "bleaching well." The water of the spring contains a natural bleaching agent from the limestone in the area, and women gather here to wash and bleach cloth on moonlit nights in summer.

## District of Kuji

East of this district is the Great Sea. On the south and west it is bordered by the district of Naka. On the north side lie the hills, which also extend to form the boundary between Michinoku Province and the district of Taka.

According to the elders, a small hill to the south of the district office was named Kuji, meaning "whale," by Prince Yamato Takeru because it is shaped like a whale.

There is a reservoir in the vicinity of Kuji Hill. It was during the reign of Emperor Tenji that Inner Minister Fujiwara -- the famed Nakatomi Kamatari, designer of the Taika Reform -- sent his deputy to supervise his stipend land. The deputy was Satomaro of the Karuno Atahi family. It was this Satomaro who constructed the dikes to form this reservoir.

A succession of dells and hills located north of the reservoir is called Taniahi Yama, the "joining hills." Large rock formations in this area are yellow in color and have trees growing in their clefts. The area is populated by monkeys. They gather, stay, and eat there often.

The village of Kafuchi is located about seven miles northwest of the district office. This village was formerly called Koko -- an onomatopoeic word for a monkey's cry. On the hill east of the village is a rock with a surface as smooth as a mirror. In the remote past, unruly aborigines lived there. They sometimes came to look at their reflections in the rock mirror. Because they looked at themselves in the mirror, they gradually became extinct. According to folklore, even the fiercest of devils will perish upon viewing its image in a mirror. The mud of this area, which is blue in color, is used to make a beautiful pigment known locally as awoni, meaning "blue pigment," or kakitsuni, meaning "colored mud." The pigment is obtained and presented to the imperial court upon request. Koko is the source of what is known as the Kuji River.

The village of Shidori, meaning "twill weaving," is three miles west of the district office. In the remote past, when the art of twill weaving had not yet been developed, the people of this village began using looms that could weave twill. This is how the place came to be called Shidori.

North of the village is a small river from which gemlike pebbles are obtained. Their texture resembles that of agate with blue stripes, likely a fine-grained variety of chalcedony. These pebbles make good flints. The river is called Tama Gaha, or Tamagawa, because of the gemlike quality of the pebbles obtained there.

The village of Yamada is two-thirds of a mile north of the district office. Most of the land within the village has been reclaimed as rice fields. Thus, the village is called Yamada, meaning "rice field on the hillside." The river running through this village originates in the hills to the north. It passes south of the district office and joins the Kuji River. Ayu fish are obtained in abundance there. They are an arm's length in size.

Along the river is a place called Ihato, meaning "rock gate," where a huge rock formation extends out over the water. Trees grow luxuriantly atop the rocks, their green leaves rustling with the wind and shuttering the sun. Beneath the cliff the water runs deep and cool, and white sand on the shore provides a comfortable respite. On hot summer days, people seeking cool air gather here from villages near and far. They sing songs of the Tsukuha melody while drinking the sweet wine made in the district. Here it is possible to forget one's troubles.

Another cliff along the river is located in the hamlet of Ohotomo, in this township. The earth in this area is yellowish. Birds gather there to peck worms from the ground.

Two miles east of the district office is the village of Ohota, which is the site of the Nagahatabe Shrine. According to the elders, the forebear of the Nagahatabe family settled in this area and opened a small weaving shop. His name was Tate, and he claimed to have descended from Kamuhata Hime, the weaving goddess. In the remote past, when the Imperial Grandson Ninigi came down from heaven, the weaving goddess followed him and descended to the top of the ridges called Futakami no Mine of Himuka in Tsukushi. She later moved from Futakami to Hikitsune Woka in Mino.

Much later, during the reign of Emperor Sujin, her descendant and the forebear of the Nagahatabe family, Tate, left Mino and settled in the district of Kuji where he built a hut and began weaving. In this hut Tate produced cloth of a magical nature -- the cloth made garments by itself. It never had to be cut or sewn. Tate's garment cloth was called utsuhata, meaning "perfectly woven." According to another version of the story, the name utsuhata derived from Tate's manner of weaving. Tate would shut himself up in his hut while he worked because he was afraid that his technique would be stolen. Thus, his cloth came to be called utsuhata, meaning "woven in secret." It is said that this cloth was so sturdy that a strong soldier could not cut the garment with a sharp blade. Even today people bring silk cloth to this shrine as a yearly gift to the goddess Kamuhata Hime.

The village of Satsu is north of the village of Ohota. In the past an unruly Kuzu called Tsuchikumo lived there. A brave deputy of the Yamato Court named Unakami summoned soldiers and destroyed this Tsuchikumo and his followers. Afterward, Unakami praised his campaign, saying, "Blessed is my campaign." This is how the place came to be called Satsu, meaning "blessed." A kind of white mud obtained in the hills around this village is used as a white pigment.

There is a high mountain called Mount Kabire located east of the village of Satsu. A heavenly deity called Tachihayahiwo is enshrined there. This god is also known by the name of Hayafuwake. He came down from heaven and initially resided in the pine branches at Matsusaha, meaning "pine marsh." The curse of this god was quite severe. Whenever people excreted facing in the direction of his residence, the god became angry and cursed their households with sickness.

The residents of the area suffered greatly from this, and they brought their problem to the Court. The Court sent Katawoka no Ohomuraji to present offerings to the god. In his prayer of supplication to the god Tachihayahiwo, Katawoka said, "Since peasants live nearby, you cannot avoid being defiled at this place. Pray stay away from this place, so as not to become offended again. You would do better to take up residence on the clean top of a high mountain." After listening to Katawoka's prayers and supplications, the god Tachihayahiwo moved to the top of Mount Kabire.

The shrine of this god atop Mount Kabire is surrounded by stone walls. Countless families are descended from this deity. Various treasures are said to have been kept in this shrine. Several rocks are even kept there as religious relics. These rocks are said to have been transformed from bows, halberds, pans, and other cooking and serving utensils belonging to the god Tachihayahiwo. Birds never fly there. It has been so since ancient times.

At the foot of Mount Kabire is Satsu no Kaha. Its source is in the hills north of this district from which it flows south to join the Kuji River.

About two-thirds of a mile northeast of what is called Takechi is the village of Mitsuki where there is a spring of clear water. People of this area call the spring Ohowi, the "large fountain." The water of this spring is cold in summer and warm in winter. The water flows out to form a river. In the hot summer, villagers from far and near gather here with food and drink. This natural setting provides an ideal spot for summer festivities.

South and east of this spring are beaches bordering the Great Sea. Abalone, sea urchin, and various kinds of fish and shellfish are abundant there. North and west of this spring is a stretch of gently rolling countryside. Pasania, oak, yew, and chestnut grow there. Deer and wild boar live in the rolling countryside. The products of sea and hills are too numerous to list.

The posting-station of Sukegaha is about nine miles northeast of the village of Mitsuki. The original name of the posting-station was Afuka. According to the elders, this name relates to Prince Yamato Takeru who at this place met his wife, Princess Great Orange. Thus, the place was called Afuka, literally meaning "meeting." When Councillor Kume was provincial governor of Hitachi, the village was renamed Sukegaha because salmon are obtained there. Adult salmon are called suke in the local dialect.

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Taka

East and south of this district is the Great Sea. On the north and west are high mountains, which form the boundary between the provinces of Michinoku and Hitachi.

According to the elders, the name Taka derives from the topographical configuration of this area. Take Misahi was appointed chieftain of Taka during the reign of Emperor Seimu. Seeing the mountains and ridges of this place while on a tour of inspection, Take Misahi named the land Taka, meaning "highland." Take Misahi was a member of the Izumo no Omi family, and he was entrusted with the area covering the present-day district of Taka and the district of Ihaki in Michinoku Province.

On his first tour of this area, Take Misahi designated Suke Gaha in the district of Kuji as the southern boundary of his territory. It is about ten miles southwest of the present district office, and today there is still a village named Michinokuchi, meaning "beginning of a territory." He designated the hamlet of Kuma as the northern boundary of his territory and called it Michinoshiri, meaning "rear half of a territory." The hamlet of Kuma now belongs to Michinoku Province.

Later, in the year 653, during the reign of Emperor Kotoku, these boundaries were altered. The magistrate of the territory, together with his kinsman, petitioned Councillor Takamuku, the governor general of Azuma. The petition was a request for permission to divide the territory into two jurisdictions. Their reasoning was that the original territory was too large, making communication and administration difficult. The governor general of Azuma granted their request and divided the region into two new districts: Taka and Ihaki. The district of Ihaki is now under the jurisdiction of present-day Michinoku Province.

There is a hamlet called Akita in the village of Michinokuchi. According to the elders, Akita was named after the august words of Prince Yamato Takeru. While on an inspection tour of Azuma, the prince stayed overnight at this place. There, a man had an audience with the prince, telling him, "There are many deer in this area. They are so plentiful that their protruding antlers look like dry reeds in the fields, and the vapor from their breath is like the morning mist. There are untold numbers of abalones in the sea here. They grow to several feet. Many other sea products are found here also."

Prince Yamato Takeru was intrigued by this man's description, and he decided to stage a hunting and fishing contest between himself and his wife, Princess Great Orange. The prince sent his wife to fish in the sea, and he went into the hills to hunt. He spent the entire day in the mountains without seeing so much as a single animal. Meanwhile, Princess Great Orange caught over a hundred fish in a short time.

When the contest was over and Prince Yamato Takeru had eaten, he said to his lords-in-waiting, "My wife and I matched our luck. Although I did not catch anything from the land and lost the contest, I have enjoyed a lot of seafood." Later generations called the place Akita, meaning "satiated," after the prince's remark.

At one time, Kuromaro of the Kahara no Sukune family held the office of provincial governor of Hitachi. It was he who had a relief sculpture of Bodhisattva Kwan-yin carved on the cliffs along the beach of the Great Sea. The icon still exists. This is how the beach came to be called Hotoke no Hama, the "Bodhisattva beach."

The posting-station of Meshima is nine miles south of the district office. On the beach southeast of the posting-station, jewellike pebbles are found. These are used to play the game of go. In all of Hitachi Province, it is only on this beach that these beautiful game stones are found.

The posting-station of Meshima got its name when Prince Yamato Takeru visited the area on tour. When the prince rowed to shore at this beach, he exclaimed over the many kinds of edible seaweed growing along the shores of the islands in this area, and he named the place Meshima, meaning "seaweed islands." The name has never been altered.
