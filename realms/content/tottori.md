The Realm of Tottori is a realm in Japan.

Absolutely — Hōki and Inaba (the two main provinces that became modern Tottori Prefecture) have some pretty notable ancient and classical-era sites and cultural highlights. Let’s break it down:

⸻

1. Hōki Province (western Tottori)
	•	Matsue and Izumo connections: Hōki was close to Izumo, so it shares some Shinto religious and mythological significance, particularly around the Izumo myth cycle.
	•	Ancient burial mounds (kofun): Hōki has several key kofun clusters, showing settlement by local elite during the Kofun period (3rd–7th c.). Examples:
	•	Higashi-Hachimanzuka Kofun – a large keyhole-shaped burial mound.
	•	Early rice agriculture: Archaeological finds suggest early wet-rice agriculture was established here, though the population was sparse compared to the Izumo plain.

2. Inaba Province (eastern Tottori)
	•	Tottori Castle area: Inaba’s historical center eventually became Tottori city. While the castle itself is Edo period, the site was strategically important in Heian and Kamakura times.
	•	Ancient shrines:
	•	Shitori Shrine (Shitori Jinja) – linked to local kami worship dating back to early provincial times.
	•	Archaeological sites:
	•	Hakuho-era Buddhist temples – ruins of early temples indicate the adoption of Buddhism in the Nara/Heian periods.
	•	Shell mounds (kaizuka): Coastal Inaba shows evidence of Jomon and Yayoi settlement, with ancient diet and trade insights.

General note

Both provinces were marginal compared to the central Yamato plains, so their fame is more archaeological and religious than political or military. They didn’t become population or economic centers, but they preserve ancient Japanese cultural layers, from Jomon settlements to kofun to early Buddhist temples.

If you want, I can make a timeline showing the key ancient sites in Hōki and Inaba from Jomon through Heian, so you can see the “famous ancient stuff” in chronological order. That usually makes it clearer why these small provinces mattered culturally even if sparsely populated. Do you want me to do that?

Old provinces: Hoki, Inaba.
