The Realm of Nagasaki is a realm in Japan.

Exactly — the historical Realm of Nagasaki corresponds roughly to modern Nagasaki Prefecture and is composed of the old provinces:
	•	Hizen Province – the mainland portion, covering much of modern Nagasaki Prefecture (western part) and Saga Prefecture. It was the largest of the three provinces.
	•	Tsushima Province – the Tsushima Islands, strategically located in the Korea Strait; important for trade, defense, and diplomacy with Korea.
	•	Iki Province – the Iki Islands, also in the Tsushima Strait, smaller but strategically important for maritime routes.

Key Historical Notes
	•	Strategic position: The Realm of Nagasaki controlled the western gateway to Japan and the Sea of Japan and had long-standing maritime importance.
	•	Foreign contact: From the 16th century onward, Nagasaki became Japan’s window to the world: Portuguese, Dutch, and Chinese traders were allowed in Nagasaki city under the Tokugawa shogunate.
	•	Economy & administration: Hizen was the main agricultural and administrative center; Tsushima and Iki served as defense and trade posts.

So in essence, Nagasaki as a “realm” was a composite of mainland and island provinces, unified more by strategic and administrative concerns than by population density.

If you want, I can also make a map showing Hizen, Tsushima, and Iki with their modern equivalents and key historical sites, so you can see how this realm functioned geographically.
