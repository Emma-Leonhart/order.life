The Realm of Oita is a realm in Japan.

Old provinces: Bungo.


The Bungo no Kuni Fudoki
ungo has eight districts {forty sato (townships), which include
110 kozato (villages) }, nine posting-stations {all these have “smallroad” status}, five beacons {all of these are of “small-province” size},
and two temples {priests reside in one and nuns in the other}.!
Formerly, Bungo and Buzen provinces constituted one administrative
unit [called Toyokuni]. In the remote past, Prince Ohotarashi [posthumously known as Emperor Keiko], who governed the realm from
Hishiro Palace in Makimuku, issued an edict and appointed Unade,
the forebear of the Toyokuni no Atahi, governor of Toyokuni. The sun
was setting when Unade [in fulfillment of the terms of his appointment]
arrived at the hamlet of Nakatomi in the district of Nakatsu of Buzen.
He spent the night in this village.’
' The word township is expressed with a Chinese graph, hsiang, which reads as
sato. Many Japanese commentators take this as proof that the Bungo fudoki was
compiled after 715 (see glossary, under go, gori-sei, and sato; see also Aoki, Izumo
fudoki 11). Small road: komichi in the original. There were three categories of
highway: ohomichi or ohoji (great road), nakamichi (medium-sized road), and
komichi or koji (small road). The categorization, or status, of a road determined the
size and facilities of its posting-station. For example, a “great road” posting-station
kept twenty horses for the use of official government travellers, while a “small
road” station kept only five. Each posting-station received an allotment of land
from the central government (“Ryo no gige,” 113, 275). Small province: The status
of a province determined the number of facilities placed there for the kindling of
beacon fires to signal a state of emergency (see glossary, under “small province”).
? Bungo and Buzen: Although it is not known exactly when these provinces
were established as separate administrative units, it must have occurred before
698. In the section relating events of that year, the SNG states that pearls from
“Bungo” Province were presented to the Court. Unade: This personage may be

At dawn the following day, white birds flew into this village from
the north. Unade ordered his men to watch the birds. Thereupon the
birds turned into rice cakes. After a while, these rice cakes turned
into taro potato plants. The plants grew continuously, and their flowers
and leaves were abundant even in winter. Unade was greatly impressed
by this phenomenon, and said, “Those transformed taro plants are
unlike any I have seen. This must be a sign of the grace of the gods in
heaven and earth.”
Unade then went to the royal Court for an audience with the
prince. The prince was overjoyed with the news. “Such is the grace of
heaven, the gift of the earth,” said the prince.” [Hereafter] your land
shall be named Toyokuni (abundant country).” The prince further
honored Unade by bestowing upon him a kabane (title) and calling
him Toyokuni no Atahi (the honest deputy of the abundant country).
Thus, the land was named Toyokuni. Later this land of Toyokuni was
divided into two provinces, one of which was named Toyo no Michi
no Shiri no Kuni [rear half of Toyokuni, or Bungo].‘
District of Hida
The district of Hida has five townships {fourteen villages} and one
posting-station.°
Unade Sukune who was the kuni no miyatsuko of Toyokuni, (Sato Shinobu, Bungo
fudoki no kenkyu [Tokyo: Meiji Shoin, 1956], 154). The hamlet of Nakatomi was
located at the present-day Miyako-gun, Fukuoka-ken (ibid., 156).
> In early Japanese belief, white birds possessed a divine nature. Also, taro
potatoes constituted the staple food of the early Japanese islanders, especially
those who lived in the southern portion of the archipelago. This story suggests the
intrusion of wet-rice agriculture into a hunting-and-gathering economy (Sasaki
Komei, Inasaku izen [Tokyo: Nippon Hoso Shuppankyokai, 1971], 202ff).
4 This story implies that there was an extremely favorable climate for wet-rice
cultivation in this area, which is a part of present-day Kyushu Island. Bungo is the
Sino-Japanese reading of the graphs adopted to express the word toyo no michi no shiri.
> Hida has the same connotation as hina (hinterland). According to a local
tradition of this area, Toba no Sukune was appointed kuni no miyatsuko of Hida
during the reign of Prince Anaho [posthumously known as Emperor Anko, r. c.
462]. Although the introduction to this section states that there were five townships, only two are described in the text. Posting-station: This was the posting-
236 The Bungo no Kuni Fudoki
In the remote past Prince Ohotarashi chastised the Kumaso. Following his victorious campaign against the Kumaso, Prince Ohotarashi
left his temporary palace at Ikuha, in Chikugo [northern Kyushu], to
return to the royal court. When the prince [followed by his retinue]
arrived in this district, he encountered a goddess named Hisa. This
deity appeared in human form to receive the royal [procession], and
gave the prince a report describing the condition of her territory [as a
gesture of submission]. Because of this event, that district was named
Hisa. Now it is called Hida, a corrupt form of Hisa.°
Township of Ishiwi. {It is south of the district office.} In ancient times
there was a Tsuchikumo fortress in this area. Unlike most fortresses, it
was [surrounded] not by stone [walls] but by earthen [walls]. Because
of this, the place was named Ishinashi no Woki (stoneless fortress).
Today people mistakenly call it Ishiwi.’
There is a large river in this township. It is called Aso Gaha and it
has its source in Mt. Wokuni of Aso District in Higo Province. In this
township the Aso Gaha joins the Kusu Gaha to become the Hida
Gaha. Ayu are abundant there. The river forms the border between
the provinces of Chikuzen and Chikugo and eventually it reaches Nishi
no Umi (the Western Sea).°
station of Ishiwi. It was located about thirty miles from Dazaifu, the administrative
headquarters of the governor general under the Taiho Code.
® Kumaso is a collective name for the early inhabitants of Kyushu Island who
resisted the Yamato forces. For various discussions regarding this term, see Sato,
Bungo fudoki no kenkyu, 168—71; and HIZ, note 3. Note that the female chieftain
Hisa, or Hisatsu Hime, is referred to as a goddess. She seems to have been a
powerful sorceress with political influence over the local people (for the word
kami, or kamu, see HIZ, note 69). Regarding the debate over the sound change
between Hisa and Hida, see Goto Kurashiro, Hizen fudoki, Bungo fudoki kosho
(Tokyo: Ookayama Shoten, 1933), 112-13; and Inoue Michiyasu, Bungo fudoki
shinko (Osaka: Kojinsha, 1935), 19-20. Among the various theories, Inoue’s is most
reasonable in light of recent scholarship concerning eighth-century phonology.
According to his theory, the sound sa of Hisa was [tsa]. It is probable that [-tsa]
changed to [-ta], and then to [-da].
’ The Ishiwi Shrine is in this area. The deity enshrined there is Toba no Sukune,
the kuni no mtyatsuko of Hida (Goto, Hizen fudoki, Bungo fudoki kosho, 114).
* Ayu: Since few ayu live longer than a year, the name means “yearly fish.” See
also HAR, note 10; HIZ, note 22; and glossary, under ayu.
The Bungo no Kuni Fudoki 267
Kagami Saka.{It is west of the district office.} At one time, Prince
Ohotarashi observed the condition of the land in this pass, and said,
“The shape of this land is like the surface of a mirror.” The place
came to be called Kagami Saka (mirror pass). This is the etymology of
the place name.?
Township of Yugiami. {It is southeast of the district office.} Long ago
Ohoashi (big feet), the forebear of the Kusakabe no Kimi, served [the
Royal Court] in a Yugibe (quiver-furnishing unit). This was during
the reign of Prince Shikishima [posthumously known as Emperor
Kimmei] who governed the realm from Shikishima Palace. This man
built his house in the area and lived there. The place was named
Yugiohi (quiver bearer). Later it was changed to Yugiami.!°
The Kusa Gaha flows through this township. It originates southeast of the district of Kusu, flows past the township of Ishiwi, and
merges with the Aso Gaha where it becomes the Hida Gaha.
Itsuma Yama. {It is south of the district office.} In the year of Tsuchinoye
» Kagami Saka is on the south side of the Mikuma River in the present-day
Hida-shi.
'© Yugi is a kind of quiver. In ancient times, reed mace was used for making
quivers. The Yugibe was the group responsible for furnishing quivers to the royal
troops. It is also possible that some Yugibe people served the royal court as archers.
The township of Yugiami was located on the site of modern Yukie-mura (Goto,
Hizen fudoki, Bungo fudoki kosho, 116; Sato, Bungo fukokino kenkyu, 176. Ohoashi:
The reading of the original graphs as muraji was accepted by most Japanese scholars
until Inoue Michiyasu read them as ohoashi, which means “big feet” (Inoue
Michiyasu, Bungo fudoki shinko, 27—28; Sato, Bungo fudoki no kenkyu, 179; see also
the glossary). Kusakabe no Kimi: Inoue Mitsusada argues that this Kimi of Kusakabe
no Kimi may not have been a kabane. Instead, he suggests that this was the selfdesignation of a local chieftain (Inoue Mitsusada, Taika kaishin, 96-97). Saeki has
a different suggestion about the same word, kimi (Saeki, Nihon kodai, 55-57; see
also HIZ, note 41). Emperor Kimmei: It has been suggested that two royal courts
existed concurrently after Emperor Keitai’s death. One would have been the court
of Prince Magari (posthumously known as Emperor Ankan, r. 534-35?) and his
successor Prince Takewo (posthumously known as Emperor Senka, r. 536—39?).
The other would have been the court of Prince Shikishima (Emperor Kimmei, r.
531?-71). See Kida Teikichi, “Keitai Tenno ika san-tenno koi keisho ni kansuru
gimon,” Rekishi chiri 52, no. | (July 1928): 15-23.
238 The Bungo no Kuni Fudoki
Tora (679), during the reign of the emperor [posthumously known as
Emperor Tenmu] who governed the realm from the Kiyomihara Palace
in Asuka, a series of great earthquakes flattened the hills and mountains of this area. One of the ridges collapsed and boiling water poured
forth profusely. The steam from the water was so hot that rice could
be steamed [in it] quickly. The earthquake also produced a geyser
ten feet in diameter. The depth of this geyser is unknown. Its water is
dark blue in color. The water of this geyser does not run continuously
but intermittently it spouts hot mud as high as ten feet. It seems as
though the geyser erupts when it is surprised by a human voice. That
is why it is now called Ikari no Yu (angrily boiling water).'!
District of Kusu
The district of Kusu has three townships {nine villages} and one
posting-station.””
There was once a big camphor tree in this district. That is why it
is called the district of Kusu (camphor).
District of Nahori
The district of Nahori has four townships {ten villages} and one postingstation.!*
"The NS records a series of great earthquakes in this area in 678. They must
have been caused by the eruption of Mt. Aso (Nihongi, part 2, 339-40).
"The three townships were Kogo, Woda, and Nagano (Goto, Hizen fudoki,
Bungo fudoki kosho, 119). Posting-station: Goto claims that this was the postingstation of Kogo, while Sato identifies it as the posting-station of Arata. The sites are
not far from each other. The area has grown to become Yokkaichi (the fourth-day
marketplace). See Sato, Bungo fudoki no kenkyu, 184-85; and Goto, Hizen fudoki,
Bungo fudoki kosho, 119.
° There is a hill in the shape of a tree stump in this area. Camphor trees grow as
tall as thirty meters (about one hundred feet). Goto claims that Kusu was so named
because this area was identified with the Kusu (or Tsuchikumo), the early inhabitants who long resisted the Yamato (ibid., 120). See also HIT, “District of Kuji.”
'* The four townships were Nahori, Kashihahara (modern Kashiwabaru),
Miyake, and Kutami. Goto says that the site is now called Furuichi (Goto, Hizen
fudoki, Bungo fudoki kosho, 121). ~
The Bungo no Kuni Fudoki 239
In ancient times there was a mulberry tree growing in the hamlet
of Kuhaki. It was very tall, with a beautiful trunk and branches. People
called the area Nahokuha (straight mulberry). Later the name was
changed to Nahori.!
Township of Kashihahara. {It is south of the district office.} In the
past, there were several oak trees growing in this township. Thus, the
township came to be called Kashihahara [oak-leaf field].'®
Negino. {It is south of the township of Kashihahara.} In the past, when
Prince Ohotarashi toured this area, there were three Tsuchikumo
leaders living there. Their names were Uchisaru, Yata, and Kunimaro.
The prince wished to conduct a [military] campaign against them.
When he arrived at this field, he issued a decree in appreciation of
the faithful service of his soldiers. That is why the place came to be
called Negino (field of appreciation).!”
Kweishino. {It is in the township of Kashihahara.} The same prince,
Prince Ohotarashi, desiring to chastise another Tsuchikumo, came
upon Kashihawo no Ohono (the great field of Kashihawo). In the
middle of the field he saw a huge rock. It was about six feet long,
three feet wide, and fifteen inches thick. The prince said, “I shall
destroy this rascal. May this rock soar like an oak leaf when I kick it.”
Thus, the prince kicked the rock. The rock soared as though it were
an oak leaf. That is how the place came to be named Kweishino (rockkicking field)."°
'5 Soil conditions in this area are favorable for the growth of mulberry trees
(Sato, Bungo fudoki no kenkyu, 196-67).
'6 Several places in Japan are named for the oak and/or the oak leaf. Kashiha
(oak leaves) were integral to the daily lives of the early Japanese, as steamed rice
was served on them. Today, on Boys’ Festival Day, the Japanese eat rice in a similar
manner. Steamed rice is lightly beaten, wrapped in an oak leaf, and served. See
also, HAR, note 136.
'7 Artifacts excavated in the area indicate that a sizable battle occurred there.
The tombs that have been uncovered date from the mid-fourth century. Nearly
identical accounts to this one, and to those in the following sections, are found in
the NS (Nihongi, part I, 194).
'8 The story is reminiscent of a children’s game still played in the area. Until
recently, a similar game was played among Koreans in Japan. A coin is wrapped in

Township of Kutami. {It is north of the district office.} There is a spring
in this village. When Prince Ohotarashi came to this place, he let the
servant responsible for preparing his meal ladle some water [from the
spring]. Thereupon, a snake was [seen] in the water. [Seeing the
snake,] the prince said, “This water must have a bad smell. Do not
use it.” Thus, the spring was named Kusaizumi (stinking spring). The
story gave rise to the name of this village, Kusaizumi. Today it is called
Kutami, a corrupt form of Kusaizumi.!
Miyakono. {It is the field in the township of Kutami.} The same prince
constructed a temporary palace at this place when he stopped on his
way to conduct an expeditionary campaign against the Tsuchikumo.
That is why the place was named Miyakono (palace site).”°
Mt. Kutami. {It is north of the district office.} There is a fire [beacon]
at the top of this mountain. It burns at all times. There are several
rivers at the foot of the mountain. They are called the Kami Kaha
(divine waters). There are also two rivers with hot water that eventually join the Kami Kaha.”!
District of Ohono
The district of Ohono has four townships {eleven villages}, two posting-stations, and one beacon.”
tissue. Competitors take turns kicking the coin with their toes. The first child to
miss the coin loses. Kweishino: The modern word for “to kick” is ke-ru. It is derived
from kwe-ru. Older people in Kyushu today retain this [qw-] sound. For example,
they say kwashi [qwasi] for kashi [kasi], meaning “cake” or “candy.”
' This story may be taken as the ancients’ way of describing the fauna of the
area. Snakes, lizards, and salamanders are considered by some locals to be water
gods. A place called Kutami is also mentioned in the IZU (see Aoki, Izumo fudoki, 110).
*® The precise location of this field has not been identified. A similar passage
concerning Emperor Keiko’s expedition to the land of Hiuga is found in the NS
(see Nihongi, part 1, 195).
1 Mt. Kutami is the present-day Kuji Yama, an active volcano with an altitude
of 1,764 meters.
* The posting-stations are Wono and Mihe. The former kept ten horses despite
the fact that it was categorized as asmall-road station, which usually maintained
The Bungo no Kuni Fudoki 241
All the places under the jurisdiction of this district are flat fields.
Thus, the district was named Ohono (great fields).
Tsubaichi and Chida. {Both are south of the district office.} In ancient
times, Prince Ohotarashi resided at the temporary palace in Kutami.
He planned to annihilate all the Tsuchikumo who were hiding in the
caves called Nezumi no Ihaya (scoundrels’ cavern). He ordered his
men to cut down a camellia tree and make mallets out of it. He then
selected the bravest soldiers from his troops, gave them the mallets,
and sent them into battle. The soldiers pushed forward, trampled the
grass on the hill, and attacked the Tsuchikumo men. All the Tsuchikumo were killed. The slaughter was such that blood ran ankle-deep
at the site.
The site where the mallets were made was named Tsubaichi (camellia
market) and the place of bloodshed was named Chida (blood-drenched
rice field).”
Amishino.{It is southwest of the district office. } Two Tsuchikumo [who
had submitted to Prince Ohotarashi] lived here. When the prince
toured this area, these Tsuchikumo, who were named Shinoka Oki
[man] and Shinoka Omi [woman], wished to present a meal to the
prince. They therefore had their men hunt in this field. The cry of
these huntsmen was so rousing that Prince Ohotarashi said, “Anamisu”
[meaning that the cry was lively and noisy]. The present-day name of
Amishino is said to derive from Anamisuno (lively field) .”
only five horses (Sato, Bungo fudoki no kenkyu, 212). The beacon was located atop
present-day Haitate Yama (ibid., 214).
23 Sato believes that this section should be placed after the description of Negino
under the district of Nahori. In this he follows Karahashi’s suggestion (Karahashi
Sesai, “Senshaku Bungo fudoki,” in Kofudoki-shu, 9a; see also Sato, Bungo fudoki
no kenkyu 218). A very similar story is recorded in the NS. Although the tale is
similar, the style is not quite the same as that of the BUN. The NS account is
wordier, and it is written in ornate, classical Chinese (Nihongi, part 1, 194-95;
Nihon shoki, [Sakamoto et al.], 1:289-91).
4 Oki and Omi: Gender is indicated here by the suffixes -ki or -gi, (masculine)
and -mi (feminine). See also HIT, “District of Kashima,” which mentions kamiromi
and kamirogi. Anamisu: Ana is an interjection. Misu must derive from bisu, of
kamabisu-shi (noisy).
242 The Bungo no Kuni Fudoki
District of Ama
The district of Ama has four townships {twelve villages}, one postingstation, and two beacons.”
All the residents of this district are ama (seafarers). Because of this
the district is called Ama.”®
Township of Nifu. {It is west of the district office.} In the past, people
used the red mud obtained from the hill in this township as pigment.
Thus, the place is called Nifu (vermilion-producing).”’
Township of Sawi. {It is east of the district office.} This township was
formerly named Sakawi.
Township of Hoto. {It is south of the district office.} In the remote
past, Prince Ohotarashi [posthumously known as Emperor Keiko], who
governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, anchored his
boat in the inlet of this township. He noticed that a beautiful seaweed grew abundantly [offshore], and ordered his men to “pick some
of the hotsume (best edible seaweed).” The seaweed was presented to
the prince at mealtime. The place was named for the princely word,
hotsume. Today it is called Hoto. Hoto is a corrupt form of Hotsume.”8
*> The four townships were Saka, Hoto, Sawi, and Nifu (Goto, Hizen fudoki,
Bungo fudoki kosho, 133; Sato, Bungo fudoki no kenkyu, 221).
*6 Judging from artifacts excavated around the shore in this area, it is certain
that these seafarers also engaged in hunting (ibid., 115; see also HIZ, note 51).
Residents: The graphs for this word are usually translated as “peasants” but for
consistency with the content of the text I have rendered them as “residents” (see
glossary, under “peasants”).
7’ The red pigment was cinnabar, or mercuric sulfide (Sato, Bungo fudoki no
kenkyu, 227); see also HIT, “District of Kuji.”
*8 Hoto is at the eastern end of the district of Ama. The name was taken from the
configuration of a peninsula and a small island that border the straits on the northeastern shore of this township. Ho means “small peninsula” and to means a “gate”;
hence, the name Hoto refers to the straits between a peninsula and an island. It is
obvious that the editor of this portion of the Bungo fudoki was unaware of the real
etymology. Hotsume: A very fine kind of the wakame sea plant. Today it is called
antokume. The word antoku derives from a legend in which the child-emperor
Antoku allegedly was drowned with a member of the Taira at Dan no Urain 1185.
The Bungo no Kuni Fudoki 243
District of Ohokida
The district of Ohokida has nine townships {twenty-five villages},
one posting-station, one beacon, and two temples Uptiests reside in
one temple and nuns in the other. }”?
In the remote past, Prince Ohotarashi [posthumously known as
Emperor Keiko], who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at
Makimuku, came upon this district when travelling from his temporary
palace at the Miyako no Kohori (capital district) of Buzen Province.
Admiring the shape of the district, he said, “How broad and spacious
is this land! It deserves the name Ohokida (large rice fields).” That is
why the district is called Ohokida.
Ohokida Gaha. {It is south of the district office.} The river emanates
from Mt. Kutami, in the District of Nahori, and flows through this
[Ohokida] district. From there it empties into the Higashi no Umi
(eastern sea). Thus, it is called Ohokida Gaha. Ayu are abundant
there.
Sakamizu. {It is west of the district office.} This river’s source is in
the rocks of Kashihano; from there it flows southward. The water is
clear and tastes sour. It is used to cure hatake (a skin infection).*©
District of Hayami
The district of Hayami has five townships {thirteen villa es}, one 8
posting-station, and one beacon.?!
2? Ohokita (or Ohokida): The Wamyosho transcribes this name as Ohoita. This
implies that a sound change had occurred by the tenth century, the compilation
date of the Wamyosho (Shohon shusei, 611). Posting-station: This was the postingstation of Takasaki. The highway around this area is still in existence (Sato, Bungo
fudoki no kenkyu, 236-37). The beacon was located atop the present-day Takasaki
Yama.
0 The water in this area still contains carbonate (ibid., 241). Hatake is a kind of
fungal infection that afflicts human skin.
31 The townships were Asami, Yasaka, Yufu, Ohomiwa, and Yamada (Goto,
Hizen fudoki, Bungo fudoki kosho, 141). The posting-stations were Nagaya and
Yufu. The beacon was located near the present-day Rokumei Toge (deer-crying pass).
244 The Bungo no Kuni Fudoki
In the remote past, Prince Ohotarashi [posthumously known as
Emperor Keiko], who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, wished to subdue the Kumaso. From Sahatsu of Suha he embarked for Tsukushi. He arrived at Miyaura in Ama District [of this
province] where he anchored his fleet.”
A woman named Hayatsuhime was a chief of this area. Upon receiving the news of the prince’s arrival, she went to receive him [in a
gesture of submission]. She informed the prince that there were five
unruly Tsuchikumo chiefs, saying, “There is a huge cavern called
Nezumi no [haya (scoundrels’ cavern) in the hill of this village. There
are two Tsuchikumo named Awo (blue) and Shiro (white). There are
also three Tsuchikumo in Negino in the district of Nahori. They are
Uchisaru, Yata, and Kunimaro. These five Tsuchikumo are savage in
nature and have many followers. All have sworn that they will never
submit to your lordship. Even if you should summon them forcibly,
they will resist your command. They will probably fight your forces.
Presently the prince sent his troops to block the [Tsuchikumos’]
access to strategic places, and he succeeded in annihilating them all.
This district was named for the female chief Hayatsuhime. People
later changed the name to Hayami.
Akayu. {It is northwest of the district office.} The mouth of this hot
spring is in the hill called Kamato Yama, northwest of the district
office. It is about fifteen feet wide. Its water is red and contains a
reddish mud. It flows eastward. The spring is named Akayu (redwater spa) after its color. The red mud can be used as pigment for
2 This is the present-day Miyanoura, located southeast of Saheki-machi,
Minamiama-gun. It is said that a fighting ship of that period could carry about
thirty-five persons (Sato, Bungo fudokino kenkyu, 248).
® The word translated as “sworn” in the text is expressed in a graph that literally
means “to sing.” It is likely that the Tsuchikumo leaders’ unyielding spirit was so
renowned that it became the theme of local ballads. Traditionally this section has
been considered a copy from the NS. However, this hypothesis should be reconsidered, for the NS account is rendered in much better classical Chinese. Thus, the
BUN account would seem to have been written prior to the compilation of the NS
(see note 23, above). The cave mentioned in the text has never been located. It is
possible that it was destroyed by a volcanic eruption.

painting the pillars of buildings. When the pigment is filtered out, the
water becomes clear.*#
Kuberiyu no Wi. {It is west of the district office.} The mouth of this
hot spring is in a cliff on the east side of Kahanaho Yama. The water
is dark in color. Mud gushes intermittently. When people sneak up to
the edge of the spring and shout loudly, the water jumps as high as
twenty feet, as if it were surprised by the noise. The steam rising from
the water is so hot that one cannot face it while approaching, and all
the plants around the spring are withered. The spring is called Ikariyu
no Wi (well of angry hot water). However, the people of this area call
it Kuberiyu no Wi (well of burning hot water).*
Township of Yufu. {It is west of the district office.} There are several
mulberry trees in this township. Ordinarily people make yufu (mulberry
charms) from these trees. That is why the township is called Yufu
(mulberry charms/strips).*®
Mt. Yufu. {It is northeast of the township of Yufu.} There is a cavern
at the top of this mountain. It is about one hundred feet deep, eightyfour feet high, and thirty feet wide. There is always ice in the cavern;
it does not melt, not even in summer. The mountain is located in the
township of Yufu. That is the reason it is called Mt. Yufu.*’
Mt. Kubi. {It is southeast of Mt. Yufu.} There is a rice field at the foot
of this mountain. Its former name was Yakata. Legend tells us why it is
now called Kubita. Once upon a time a deer came to this field and
ate the young rice seedlings every time they sprouted. The owner of
the rice field devised a plan, erected a fence around the rice field,
*# This spring is located at the present-day Beppu Spa. The water temperature
is about 77 degrees centigrade. The reading for the name Akayu follows Hisamatsu
(Fudoki [Hisamatsu]).
> Although there are several hot springs in the area, the site of this geyser is not
identifiable today.
© The site of this township is now called Yufu-no-in. The name Yufu derived
from the fact that the area produced mulberry from which yufu strips (the predecessors of paper strips) were obtained (see the second poem in HIT, “District of
Kashima”).

and waited. The next time the deer came to the field, it put its neck
through the fence [so that it could reach] the seedlings and eat them.
The owner caught the deer. As he was about to slay the animal, it
begged for its life, saying, “I shall take an oath now. Forgive my grave
offense. If I am released alive, I will command my offspring never to
eat your seedlings.” The man marveled at the animal’s words and
decided not to kill it. Since that time, no seedlings in this rice paddy
have ever been eaten by deer. The crops grow until harvest time. The
rice field was named for the neck of the deer. Hence, it is called
Kubita (neck field). The word kubi (neck) also gave rise to the name
of Mt. Kubi.’8
Tano. {It is southwest of the district office.} It is a broad field with
fertile soil. The ease with which this [land] could be reclaimed was
once unsurpassed [in all the province]. In the past, many farmers of
the district tilled this field and always they reaped abundant harvests.
The abundance was such that the farmers left the surplus lying in the
rice field. As a result, the villagers grew extravagant [and ungrateful].
They began to use rice cakes as archery targets. At this [ultimate
wastefulness], the rice cakes turned into white birds, which flew away
to the south. Within a year, all the farmers of the village were dead
and the rice fields lay in waste. Since that time, rice farming has never
been good here. That is why the place is now called Tano (wasted
tice land).*?
District of Kunisaki
The district of Kunisaki has six townships {sixteen villages}. When
he embarked on his expeditionary campaign [against the Kumaso]
from Sahatsu of Suhau, Prince Ohotarshi [posthumously known as
Emperor Keiko], who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at
Makimuku, viewed this land from a distance, and said, “The land |
** Mt. Kubi is perhaps the present-day Jogatake, which is about 1,150 meters
above sea level. Even today deer are frequently seen in this area. The climate must
be favorable for animals such as deer and monkeys.
* Apparently this place became a wasteland after being inundated with volcanic
ash.
The Bungo Fudoki 247
see must be a peninsula.” Thus, the district is called Kunisaki (headland or peninsula).*°
Township of Imi. {It is north of the district office.} The same prince
came to this village, and said, “It has been a long journey to this land.
The mountains and valleys are dangerous and forbidding to travel
through, and yet here I am at last.” Thus, the village was named
Kunimi (land-viewing). The area is now called the township of Imi.
Imi is believed to have derived from kunimi.*!
* The district of Kunisaki was located at the northeastern edge of Bungo
Province, which overlooks Honshu Island on the north and Shikoku Island on the
east. Saki (in Kunisaki) means “cape.” The Wamyosho lists seven townships rather
than six: Musashi, Kunaha, Kunisaki, Tashimu, Aki, Tsumori, and Imi (Shohon
shusei, 660).
41 “7 and-viewing” was a gesture of conquest. See HAR, under “District of
Ihibo,” in which countless land-viewings are mentioned.
