The Realm of Oita is a realm in Japan.

Oita Prefecture is organized into modern municipalities, while these historical districts are retained in this fudoki-style account.

Formerly, Bungo and Buzen formed one administrative unit called Toyokuni. In the remote past, Prince Ohotarashi, posthumously known as Emperor Keiko, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace in Makimuku, issued an edict and appointed Unade, the forebear of the Toyokuni no Atahi, governor of Toyokuni. The sun was setting when Unade arrived at the hamlet of Nakatomi in the district of Nakatsu of Buzen, where he spent the night.

At dawn the following day, white birds flew into the village from the north. In early Japanese belief, white birds possessed a divine nature. Unade ordered his men to watch the birds. Thereupon the birds turned into rice cakes. After a while, these rice cakes turned into taro potato plants. The plants grew continuously, and their flowers and leaves were abundant even in winter. Unade was greatly impressed by this phenomenon, and said, "Those transformed taro plants are unlike any I have seen. This must be a sign of the grace of the gods in heaven and earth."

Unade then went to the royal Court for an audience with the prince. The prince was overjoyed with the news. "Such is the grace of heaven, the gift of the earth," said the prince. "Hereafter your land shall be named Toyokuni (abundant country)." The prince further honored Unade by bestowing upon him a kabane (title) and calling him Toyokuni no Atahi (the honest deputy of the abundant country). Thus, the land was named Toyokuni. In this modern retelling, that older land is treated as the historical root of present-day Oita Prefecture.

## District of Hida

The district of Hida has five townships and one posting-station. The name Hida carries the same connotation as hina, meaning "hinterland."

In the remote past Prince Ohotarashi chastised the Kumaso, a collective name for the early inhabitants of Kyushu who resisted the Yamato forces. Following his victorious campaign against the Kumaso, Prince Ohotarashi left his temporary palace at Ikuha, in Chikugo, to return to the royal court. When the prince arrived in this district, he encountered a goddess named Hisa. This deity appeared in human form to receive the royal procession, and gave the prince a report describing the condition of her territory as a gesture of submission. Because of this event, that district was named Hisa. Now it is called Hida, a corrupt form of Hisa.

Township of Ishiwi. In ancient times there was a Tsuchikumo fortress in this area. Unlike most fortresses, it was surrounded not by stone walls but by earthen walls. Because of this, the place was named Ishinashi no Woki (stoneless fortress). Today people mistakenly call it Ishiwi.

There is a large river in this township. It is called Aso Gaha and it has its source in Mt. Wokuni of Aso District in old Higo. In this township the Aso Gaha joins the Kusu Gaha to become the Hida Gaha. Ayu, a kind of yearly fish so named because few live longer than a year, are abundant there. The river forms an old regional boundary and eventually it reaches Nishi no Umi (the Western Sea).

Kagami Saka. At one time, Prince Ohotarashi observed the condition of the land in this pass, and said, "The shape of this land is like the surface of a mirror." The place came to be called Kagami Saka (mirror pass). This is the etymology of the place name.

Township of Yugiami. Long ago Ohoashi (big feet), the forebear of the Kusakabe no Kimi, served the Royal Court in a Yugibe, a quiver-furnishing unit responsible for supplying quivers to the royal troops. This was during the reign of Prince Shikishima, posthumously known as Emperor Kimmei, who governed the realm from Shikishima Palace. This man built his house in the area and lived there. The place was named Yugiohi (quiver bearer). Later it was changed to Yugiami.

The Kusa Gaha flows through this township. It originates southeast of the district of Kusu, flows past the township of Ishiwi, and merges with the Aso Gaha where it becomes the Hida Gaha.

Itsuma Yama. In the year of Tsuchinoye Tora (679), during the reign of the emperor posthumously known as Emperor Tenmu, who governed the realm from the Kiyomihara Palace in Asuka, a series of great earthquakes flattened the hills and mountains of this area. They must have been caused by the eruption of Mt. Aso. One of the ridges collapsed and boiling water poured forth profusely. The steam from the water was so hot that rice could be steamed in it quickly. The earthquake also produced a geyser ten feet in diameter. The depth of this geyser is unknown. Its water is dark blue in color. The water of this geyser does not run continuously but intermittently it spouts hot mud as high as ten feet. It seems as though the geyser erupts when it is surprised by a human voice. That is why it is now called Ikari no Yu (angrily boiling water).

## District of Kusu

The district of Kusu has three townships and one posting-station.

There was once a big camphor tree in this district. That is why it is called the district of Kusu (camphor).

## District of Nahori

The district of Nahori has four townships and one posting-station.

In ancient times there was a mulberry tree growing in the hamlet of Kuhaki. It was very tall, with a beautiful trunk and branches. People called the area Nahokuha (straight mulberry). Later the name was changed to Nahori.

Township of Kashihahara. In the past, there were several oak trees growing in this township. Thus, the township came to be called Kashihahara (oak-leaf field). Oak leaves were integral to the daily lives of the early Japanese, as steamed rice was served on them.

Negino. In the past, when Prince Ohotarashi toured this area, there were three Tsuchikumo leaders living there. Their names were Uchisaru, Yata, and Kunimaro. The prince wished to conduct a military campaign against them. When he arrived at this field, he issued a decree in appreciation of the faithful service of his soldiers. That is why the place came to be called Negino (field of appreciation).

Kweishino. The same prince, Prince Ohotarashi, desiring to chastise another Tsuchikumo, came upon Kashihawo no Ohono (the great field of Kashihawo). In the middle of the field he saw a huge rock. It was about six feet long, three feet wide, and fifteen inches thick. The prince said, "I shall destroy this rascal. May this rock soar like an oak leaf when I kick it." Thus, the prince kicked the rock. The rock soared as though it were an oak leaf. That is how the place came to be named Kweishino (rock-kicking field).

Township of Kutami. There is a spring in this village. When Prince Ohotarashi came to this place, he let the servant responsible for preparing his meal ladle some water from the spring. Thereupon, a snake was seen in the water. Seeing the snake, the prince said, "This water must have a bad smell. Do not use it." Thus, the spring was named Kusaizumi (stinking spring). The story gave rise to the name of this village, Kusaizumi. Today it is called Kutami, a corrupt form of Kusaizumi.

Miyakono. The same prince constructed a temporary palace at this place when he stopped on his way to conduct an expeditionary campaign against the Tsuchikumo. That is why the place was named Miyakono (palace site).

Mt. Kutami. There is a fire beacon at the top of this mountain, an active volcano rising to 1,764 meters. It burns at all times. There are several rivers at the foot of the mountain. They are called the Kami Kaha (divine waters). There are also two rivers with hot water that eventually join the Kami Kaha.

## District of Ohono

The district of Ohono has four townships, two posting-stations, and one beacon.

All the places under the jurisdiction of this district are flat fields. Thus, the district was named Ohono (great fields).

Tsubaichi and Chida. In ancient times, Prince Ohotarashi resided at the temporary palace in Kutami. He planned to annihilate all the Tsuchikumo who were hiding in the caves called Nezumi no Ihaya (scoundrels' cavern). He ordered his men to cut down a camellia tree and make mallets out of it. He then selected the bravest soldiers from his troops, gave them the mallets, and sent them into battle. The soldiers pushed forward, trampled the grass on the hill, and attacked the Tsuchikumo men. All the Tsuchikumo were killed. The slaughter was such that blood ran ankle-deep at the site.

The site where the mallets were made was named Tsubaichi (camellia market) and the place of bloodshed was named Chida (blood-drenched rice field).

Amishino. Two Tsuchikumo who had submitted to Prince Ohotarashi lived here. When the prince toured this area, these Tsuchikumo, who were named Shinoka Oki (man) and Shinoka Omi (woman), wished to present a meal to the prince. They therefore had their men hunt in this field. The cry of these huntsmen was so rousing that Prince Ohotarashi said, "Anamisu," meaning that the cry was lively and noisy. The present-day name of Amishino is said to derive from Anamisuno (lively field).

## District of Ama

The district of Ama has four townships, one posting-station, and two beacons.

All the residents of this district are ama (seafarers). Because of this the district is called Ama.

Township of Nifu. In the past, people used the red mud obtained from the hill in this township as pigment. The red pigment was cinnabar, or mercuric sulfide. Thus, the place is called Nifu (vermilion-producing).

Township of Sawi. This township was formerly named Sakawi.

Township of Hoto. In the remote past, Prince Ohotarashi, posthumously known as Emperor Keiko, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, anchored his boat in the inlet of this township. He noticed that a beautiful seaweed grew abundantly offshore, and ordered his men to "pick some of the hotsume (best edible seaweed)." The seaweed was presented to the prince at mealtime. The place was named for the princely word, hotsume. Today it is called Hoto. Hoto is a corrupt form of Hotsume.

## District of Ohokida

The district of Ohokida has nine townships, one posting-station, one beacon, and two temples.

In the remote past, Prince Ohotarashi, posthumously known as Emperor Keiko, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, came upon this district when travelling from his temporary palace at the Miyako no Kohori (capital district) of Buzen Province. Admiring the shape of the district, he said, "How broad and spacious is this land! It deserves the name Ohokida (large rice fields)." That is why the district is called Ohokida. The name later became Ohoita, which gives the modern prefecture its name.

Ohokida Gaha. The river emanates from Mt. Kutami, in the District of Nahori, and flows through this district. From there it empties into the Higashi no Umi (eastern sea). Thus, it is called Ohokida Gaha. Ayu are abundant there.

Sakamizu. This river's source is in the rocks of Kashihano; from there it flows southward. The water is clear and tastes sour. It is used to cure hatake, a kind of fungal skin infection.

## District of Hayami

The district of Hayami has five townships, one posting-station, and one beacon.

In the remote past, Prince Ohotarashi, posthumously known as Emperor Keiko, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, wished to subdue the Kumaso. From Sahatsu of Suha he embarked for Tsukushi. He arrived at Miyaura in Ama District where he anchored his fleet.

A woman named Hayatsuhime was a chief of this area. Upon receiving the news of the prince's arrival, she went to receive him in a gesture of submission. She informed the prince that there were five unruly Tsuchikumo chiefs, saying, "There is a huge cavern called Nezumi no Ihaya (scoundrels' cavern) in the hill of this village. There are two Tsuchikumo named Awo (blue) and Shiro (white). There are also three Tsuchikumo in Negino in the district of Nahori. They are Uchisaru, Yata, and Kunimaro. These five Tsuchikumo are savage in nature and have many followers. All have sworn that they will never submit to your lordship. Even if you should summon them forcibly, they will resist your command. They will probably fight your forces."

Presently the prince sent his troops to block the Tsuchikumo's access to strategic places, and he succeeded in annihilating them all. This district was named for the female chief Hayatsuhime. People later changed the name to Hayami.

Akayu. The mouth of this hot spring is in the hill called Kamato Yama, northwest of the district office. It is about fifteen feet wide. Its water is red and contains a reddish mud. It flows eastward. The spring is named Akayu (red-water spa) after its color. The red mud can be used as pigment for painting the pillars of buildings. When the pigment is filtered out, the water becomes clear. This spring is located at the present-day Beppu Spa.

Kuberiyu no Wi. The mouth of this hot spring is in a cliff on the east side of Kahanaho Yama. The water is dark in color. Mud gushes intermittently. When people sneak up to the edge of the spring and shout loudly, the water jumps as high as twenty feet, as if it were surprised by the noise. The steam rising from the water is so hot that one cannot face it while approaching, and all the plants around the spring are withered. The spring is called Ikariyu no Wi (well of angry hot water). However, the people of this area call it Kuberiyu no Wi (well of burning hot water).

Township of Yufu. There are several mulberry trees in this township. Ordinarily people make yufu (mulberry charms) from these trees, the predecessors of paper strips used in rituals. That is why the township is called Yufu.

Mt. Yufu. There is a cavern at the top of this mountain, which rises about 1,600 meters above sea level. The cavern is about one hundred feet deep, eighty-four feet high, and thirty feet wide. There is always ice in the cavern; it does not melt, not even in summer. The mountain is located in the township of Yufu. That is the reason it is called Mt. Yufu.

Mt. Kubi. There is a rice field at the foot of this mountain. Its former name was Yakata. Legend tells us why it is now called Kubita. Once upon a time a deer came to this field and ate the young rice seedlings every time they sprouted. The owner of the rice field devised a plan, erected a fence around the rice field, and waited. The next time the deer came to the field, it put its neck through the fence so that it could reach the seedlings and eat them. The owner caught the deer. As he was about to slay the animal, it begged for its life, saying, "I shall take an oath now. Forgive my grave offense. If I am released alive, I will command my offspring never to eat your seedlings." The man marveled at the animal's words and decided not to kill it. Since that time, no seedlings in this rice paddy have ever been eaten by deer. The crops grow until harvest time. The rice field was named for the neck of the deer. Hence, it is called Kubita (neck field). The word kubi (neck) also gave rise to the name of Mt. Kubi.

Tano. It is a broad field with fertile soil. The ease with which this land could be reclaimed was once unsurpassed in all the region. In the past, many farmers of the district tilled this field and always they reaped abundant harvests. The abundance was such that the farmers left the surplus lying in the rice field. As a result, the villagers grew extravagant and ungrateful. They began to use rice cakes as archery targets. At this ultimate wastefulness, the rice cakes turned into white birds, which flew away to the south. Within a year, all the farmers of the village were dead and the rice fields lay in waste. Since that time, rice farming has never been good here. That is why the place is now called Tano (wasted rice land).

## District of Kunisaki

The district of Kunisaki has six townships. When he embarked on his expeditionary campaign against the Kumaso from Sahatsu of Suha, Prince Ohotarashi, posthumously known as Emperor Keiko, who governed the realm from Hishiro Palace at Makimuku, viewed this land from a distance, and said, "The land I see must be a peninsula." Thus, the district is called Kunisaki (headland or peninsula).

Township of Imi. The same prince came to this village, and said, "It has been a long journey to this land. The mountains and valleys are dangerous and forbidding to travel through, and yet here I am at last." Thus, the village was named Kunimi (land-viewing), a gesture of conquest signifying dominion over the landscape. The area is now called the township of Imi. Imi is believed to have derived from Kunimi.

Historical province: Bungo.
