## District of Kako

Looking all around him, Emperor Ojin said, "This land is shaped like a huge deer with rolling hills and stretching fields!" Thus, this district came to be called Kako. When the prince went out hunting, a deer ran up this hill and cried out "hee-hee." Therefore, the hill was named Hiwoka. The residing deity there is Ihatsuhiko (Prince of Rock), the son of Ohomitsuha. Hire Haka is located on this hill. It is called Hire Haka because of the following story:

Once upon a time Prince Ohotarashi decided to court Wake Iratsume (Princess Wake) of Inami. On the courting journey he wore a long sword decorated with carved jewels and a bright mirror. He took Okinaga, also called Ishiji, along to serve as his escort. This man is the forebear of the Yama no Atahi family in Kamo District of this province. Prince Ohotarashi and his escort arrived at the ford of the Takase in Settsu. At the prince's request for a ferry, the boatman, a resident of Kii named Wotama, said, "I am not your subject, sir." The prince replied, "Nevertheless, let me cross the river, agi my dear man." The man answered, "If you wish to cross here, you must pay the fare." Thereupon the prince threw the boatman his travelling cap. It lay in the boat with its jewels glistening in the sun. Upon receiving this unusual fare, the boatman ferried the prince across the river. Thus, the place came to be called Agi ford, after the prince's manner of addressing the boatman.

The prince arrived at Kashihade no Miwi in the district of Akashi where he took his princely meal. Thus, the place was named Kashihade no Miwi (the well of Kashihade).

Meanwhile in Kako, Princess Wake learned of the prince's journey to seek her hand in marriage and she fled in fear to an island. The prince arrived on the shore of Kako no Matsuhara (pine groves of Kako) only to find the princess gone and a white dog barking in the direction of the sea. White animals were regarded by the early Japanese as bringing good fortune. The prince inquired, "Whose dog is this?" Suzumura no Obito (local chieftain of Suzumura) answered, "It is Princess Wake's dog." The prince said, "Your information is of great help to me." Thus, the man was renamed Tsuge no Obito (chief informant).

Having learned of the princess's whereabouts, the prince wished to cross the straits to the island. He went to Ahetsu (Ahe harbor) where he ate his ahe (meal). Thereafter, the place came to be called the village of Ahe. Fish caught in the straits were served to the prince on a mitsuki tray, a small serving tray with a single stem at the center. This is why the place is called Mitsuki. The prince ordered a wharf to be built of young tree branches from which he embarked for the island. Thus, the place came to be called Tanatsu (wharf).

Upon reaching the island and seeing the princess for the first time, the prince's first words to her were, "Nabihashi tsuma of the isle," meaning "My beloved wife who has been hiding on this island," for in the old tongue nabi means "to hide," hashi means "lovely," and tsuma means "sweetheart." The island then became known as Nabitsuma (hiding wife). The prince tied his boat to hers and gave his pilot Okinaga a new name, Ohonaka no Ishiji (Ishiji the grand intermediary). The escort guided their boats back to the mainland.

Upon returning to the mainland the couple journeyed to the village of Mutsugi in the district of Inami in order to conduct their mutsubigoto (lovers' talk) for the first time. The place therefore came to be called by the name of Mutsugi (a derivation of mutsubigoto). The prince was not pleased with this place. He complained, "The sound of waves and cries of birds here are annoying." Thus, he and his wife moved to a palace built on higher ground, the site of which later came to be called Takamiya (palace on the high ground).

Several buildings were added to the palace grounds. The site of the sake brewery became the village of Sakaya (sake brewery). The site of the pantry and kitchen became the village of Niheta, and the basement storehouse became the village of Murotsumi.

For his wedding ceremony, the prince moved to a newly constructed fortified palace, called kimiya in the old tongue, for ki means a Korean-style fortress. After the ceremony, he presented his escort, Okinaga Ohonaka no Ishiji, with one of the palace's ladies-in-waiting. This was Hisura, a daughter of the Izumo no Omi. This man's grave is located west of the posting-station of Kako.

Years passed and Princess Wake died at the fortified palace. For her grave the prince chose a site on Hiwoka. As the funeral procession was crossing Inami Gaha (Inami river), a cyclone rose from downstream, causing the waves to suck the body of the deceased into the river. Her body was never recovered; only her comb box and scarf were found. The funeral was conducted with the burial of these two objects. That is why the place is called Hire Haka (scarf tomb).

Grief stricken, the prince swore never to eat another fish from this river. As a result, ayu caught in Inami Gaha may not be used as tribute presented to the court.

In later years the prince himself became ill. In early Japanese belief, a place where a person became ill was considered to be contaminated, and when stricken by illness people moved to ward off such contamination. A new palace was constructed at his request in Kako no Matsuhara. The prince moved into the new palace. There a man found a good vein of water and dug a well. Because of this, the area came to be known as Matsuhara no Miwi (august well in the pine grove).

Village of Magari. The condition of the soil in this village is slightly above average. When Prince Ohotarashi made an inspection tour of this area, he noticed the river winding through this village, and he said, "The curve of this river is very beautiful." That is why the place is called Magari (curve).

Village of Ahaha. The condition of the soil in this village is about average. In ancient times, Korime, the forebear of the Ohotomo no Miyatsuko, tilled this land and sowed a great deal of millet. Korime was known as a Korean immigrant from Kara. The place is therefore called Ahaha (abundant millet).

There is a field in this village called Funahiki. It is said that in the past there was a tempestuous god in the nearby village of Kamusaki who detained half the boats that passed there. Therefore, boatmen passing through the area tried to avoid the god by entering Ohotsu no E (Ohotsu inlet) in Inami and rowing upstream on the Inami Gaha (Inami river). At the dale of Kaworita the boatmen would pull their vessels over the land, dragging them as far as Hayashi no Minato (waterway of Hayashi) in the district of Akashi. This is why the field is called Funahiki (boat-pulling).

The etymology for the name Hayashi no Minato is the same as that provided in the report from the district of Akashi above.

Village of Nagata. The condition of the soil is about average. Once upon a time, there was a long rice-field located along the road that Prince Ohotarashi was accustomed to take to visit Princess Wake. While passing the field one day, the prince was heard to say, "What a long rice-field this is!" Therefore, the place came to be called the village of Nagata (long rice-fields).

Village of Umaya. The condition of the soil is about average. This village belongs to the umaya, or posting-station. Because of this function, it is called Umaya no Sato (village of the posting-station).

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Inami

According to a tradition, the district of Inami was named after the calm waves of the sea during the time of Prince Tarashi Naka, posthumously known as Emperor Chuai, who governed the realm from Toyora Palace in Anato. The prince was to go down to Kumaso State in Tsukushi, accompanied by his wife. En route to Tsukushi their boat was anchored at the shore of Inami. At that time the sea was very calm, the wind and waves quiet. Therefore, it was named Irinami (quiet waves). Inami is the derivation of Irinami.

Village of Ohokuni. The condition of the soil is about average. Ohokuni was named after the peasants' dwellings located there. They were so numerous that the place came to be called Ohokuni (thickly populated, or large territory).

In this village there is a hill called Iho Yama. When Prince Tarashi Naka passed away, his wife, Princess Okinaga Tarashi, took Ohoku of the Ishitsukuri no Muraji (chief stonecutter) as her guide and travelled to Sanuki in search of hawaka stones for the prince's burial chamber. The site of the funerary shed had not yet been chosen when Ohoku found the right kind of stones. Returning from Sanuki, Ohoku discovered this hill and found it suitable for the burial site. That is why the site is called Iho Yama (sepulchral mound).

There is a field on the west side of this hill. In the field is a pond. Thus, the field is called Ike no Hara (pond field). In the southern part of this field there is a piece of sculpture in the shape of a house. It is about twenty feet long, fifteen feet wide, and fifteen feet high. The sculpture is called Ohoishi (great stone). It is said that the stone was carved by the order of the Yuge no Ohomuraji during Prince Shotoku's reign.

Village of Mutsugi. The condition of the soil is about average. The reason the place is called Mutsugi is discussed above. In this village there is a pine grove where mushrooms grow abundantly. Their color is like that of the flower of the namomi plant, and their shape is like that of uguhisutake mushrooms. They sprout early in the tenth month and last about twenty days. The taste of these mushrooms is excellent.

Village of Yake. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Yake is named after Prince Ohotarashi's granaries, which were built in this village. That is why it is called the village of Yake (royal granary).

In this village are two monuments called Masukata Yama. Both are made of rocks. One monument resembles a square measuring cup, and the other is like a barrel. Situated near them is a stone bridge. It is said that once this bridge reached the sky and people climbed up and down between heaven and earth. That is why it is called Yaso Hashi (bridge crossed by the multitudes).

Village of Kamuki. The former name was Kame-ochi. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Kame-ochi was named after an incident that occurred during the reign of Prince Takatsu, posthumously known as Emperor Nintoku, who governed the realm from Takatsu Palace in Naniha. Kumachi from Wosada, the forebear of the Kisakibe archers, travelled this area looking for a suitable place to build his house. He tied a wine jar to the flank of the horse he was riding. While he was in this village, the wine jar fell off and landed on the ground. Thus, the village was named Kame-ochi (jar-dropping).

There is also a place called Saka Yama in this village. During the time of Prince Ohotarashi a spring of wine issued forth at this place. This is why it was named Saka Yama (wine hill). Whenever the farmers became intoxicated with this wine, they fought each other wildly. Hence, the prince ordered that the spring be plugged. Later, in the year of Kanoye Uma (670) someone reopened the spring. The water of this spring still retains the flavor of sake wine.

There is a small island called Nabitsuma in the sea off the southern coast of this district. Prince Taka Anaho, posthumously known as Emperor Seimu, who governed the realm from the palace of Taka Anaho in Shiga, sent Hikonamuchi, the ancestor of the Wanibe no Omi, to determine the provincial boundaries. At that time Kibihiko and Kibihime (the chieftains of this area) came to see the royal surveyor Hikonamuchi. Hikonamuchi wed Kibihime, and she gave birth to a girl. This girl was Wake Iratsume of Inami, the Princess Wake who later married Prince Ohotarashi. Her beauty was unsurpassed. Prince Ohotarashi wished to marry this maiden and went to court her. Learning of his impending visit, the princess fled to this island and hid herself there. That is why the island is called Nabitsuma (hiding wife).

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Shikama

The district of Shikama was named after the words of Prince Ohomima. Once, when he was staying at his temporary palace in this district, he heard the loud cry of a deer. The prince exclaimed, "Oh, the deer cries so!" Because of this, it is called the district of Shikama (deer-crying land).

Village of Ayabe. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Ayabe was named after immigrants who came from the land of Sanuki on Shikoku Island to live there. That is why the place is called Ayabe (immigrant group).

Village of Sugafu. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Sugafu was named after the sedge fields surrounding this area. That is why it is called Sugafu (sedge-growing).

Village of Masaki. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Masaki was named after the words of Prince Homuda, posthumously known as Emperor Oujin. When the prince came upon this area while on an inspection tour, he said, "These two hills remind me of a man's tattooed eyes." This refers to a type of permanent eyeshadow applied to the outer edges of the eyes in a particular design so as to make them look larger. That is why it is called Masaki (tattooed eyes).

Village of Aga. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. The village is named after the two deities who reside there. They are Agahiko and Agahime, the son and daughter of the Great God of Iwa. Because of this the place is called Aga.

Village of Iwa. This village includes the areas of Funawoka, Namiwoka, Kotowoka, Hakowoka, Kushigewoka, Miwoka, Mikawoka, Inawoka, Kabutowoka, Ikariwoka, Fujiwoka, Shikawoka, Inuwoka, and Himejiwoka. The condition of the soil of this village is slightly above average. Iwa-be was named after the people who migrated there. Iwa no Kimi and his family came from the district of Shisaha to settle in this area. That is why it came to be known as Iwabe.

There is a hill called Tegariwoka in this village. Tegariwoka was named after the deed of a neighborhood deity who came to this area to cut grass by hand, and who wove a mat on which to sit while eating. That is why it is called Tegariwoka (hand-cut hill). According to another version, Korean immigrants in this area did not know how to use the sickle, so they simply cut grass by hand. Their method of cutting grass gave the village the name Tegari (cutting by hand).

Apart from Tegariwoka, the aforesaid fourteen hills are described in detail, as follows. Long ago, Hoakari, the son of Ohonamuchi, was known for his fierce and reckless nature. Ohonamuchi, the tutelary deity of the Izumo people also known as Ohokuninushi (great land holder), was very upset by his son's temperament, and he decided to disown him. He devised a scheme to get rid of him. He took his son to Kamiyama (godly hill) in the village of Idate and ordered him to fetch some water. The area was adjacent to the sea in those days. Before Hoakari could return, Ohonamuchi embarked upon the water to escape.

When Hoakari returned with the water, he spied his father's boat sailing away. Outraged, he caused winds and high waves to rise, and chased his father's boat. Ohonamuchi's boat was unable to navigate under such conditions and was wrecked. The area where the ship was wrecked thus came to be known as Funawoka (boat hill) and Namiwoka (wavy hill). When his boat broke up, Ohonamuchi's belongings were thrown into the sea and transformed into several hills. Thus, Kotokamiwoka (zither-god hill) appeared at the site where Ohonamuchi's zither fell. Hakowoka (box hill) appeared at the site where his box fell, and Kushigewoka (comb hill) where his comb dropped. At the site to which the winnow was thrown, Mikatawoka (winnower hill) emerged. Likewise, the place where Ohonamuchi's wine jar fell produced Mikawoka (jar hill). The place where his rice sank into the water yielded Inamurewoka (rice hill). Ohonamuchi's weapons also sank and were transformed into hills. These are Kabutowoka (helmet hill), Ikariwoka (anchor hill), and Fujiwoka (wisteria-rope hill). Ohonamuchi's animals were also transformed into hills. Thus emerged Shikawoka (deer hill), Inuwoka (dog hill), and Himejiwoka (silkworm hill). This last hill is the origin of the name of present-day Himeji City.

Ohonamuchi later spoke of his misfortune to his wife Princess Notsu, saying, "I intended to escape from that reckless child but the consequences were worse than I expected. I suffered much from rough winds and waves." This is why the area is called Ikashiho (angry waves), or Tashiname no Watari (ford of suffering).

Village of Kaya (mosquito netting). Mitegurawoka is in this village. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Kaya was named after the mosquito net that protected Prince Homuda from bites while he was travelling in this area. The prince had his hut built at this place and put up a mosquito net in the building. That is why the place is called Kaya (mosquito netting). The same word is the etymology for the hill and the river in this village.

Mitegurawoka. It was named after a deed of Prince Homuda. The prince went to the top of this hill to present gifts to the local deities. The hill therefore was named Mitegurawoka (gift-offering hill).

Village of Karamuro. The condition of the soil is about average. Karamuro is named after Korean-style storage buildings. The forebear of Takara of the Karamuro no Obito family was very wealthy and successful. He erected Korean-style buildings around the area. That is how the place came to be known by the name of Karamuro (Korean-style houses).

Village of Kochi. The hamlets of Kusakami and Ohotachiwoka belong to this village. The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior class. The Kochi, an immigrant family that settled in this village, was the first to clear the farmland. Thus, the family name of Kochi came to designate this village.

The name of Kusakami hamlet also has some relation to an immigrant family. Kana, of the Nara no Kochi, who is the forebear of Yamamura, originally from Korea, requested this land for reclamation. At that time there was grass growing there, the roots of which had a distinct odor. That is why the hamlet came to be known by the name Kusakami (stinking grass).

Ohotachiwoka was named after an act of Prince Homuda. One day the prince went to the top of this hill to observe the land. That is why the hill is called Ohotachi (grandstand).

Village of Asako. Nagaunegaha runs through this village. The condition of the soil is about average. Asako was named after the birthplace of the farmers who settled in this area. The story goes back to the time of Prince Homuda's reign. Prince Homuda came to this place from the land of Tajima. On his way he was unable to obtain materials for his head ornament, mikage. This gave one hill of the area the name Kageyama no Saki (hill without headdress). Toyo Oshiwake, the kuni no miyatsuko, was stripped of his title and office.

Presently Akone, the kuni no miyatsuko of Tajima, came to his rescue. Akone interceded with the prince for Toyo Oshiwake, in an attempt to have the latter's offense pardoned. According to the agreement then concluded, Toyo Oshiwake surrendered about ten acres of rice field, labelled salt land, to compensate for his offense, and he regained his title and office.

The prince arranged for his farmers from Asako, in the land of Tajima, to settle this newly acquired rice land. That is how the village came to be known as Asako. It was formerly called Asakobe. The word asako was expressed by one graph. Later, according to the order of the Council of State, the word asako came to be expressed by two graphs.

According to the source material for this report, Akone married a woman from the village of Aho. He lived with her in this village until the time of his death. When he died his people constructed a tomb and buried him in the village. It is said that later his remains were moved to his place of origin.

Nagaunegaha was named after the village of Nagaune in Kamo District from which people would go to harvest makomo (wild rice). A struggle ensued between these people and the followers of Ishitsukuri no Muraji who had settled there. The earlier settlers tried to prevent the people of Nagaune from stealing. They killed them and threw their bodies into the river. The river was named after the village of the slain people, Nagaune.

Village of Hirano. The hamlet of Shirakuni and the hill called Hakowoka belong to this village. The place now called Hirano (reclaimed land) was once called Wono (small field). The hamlet of Shirakuni was named after a group of people who came from Shiragi (Silla) in the past. When the envoys of the Silla Court came to the Japanese Court to present tribute, they usually took lodging in this village. That is why it is called Shirakuni (place of Sillans). There is also a hill of the same name.

Hakowoka was named after the utensils of Princess Himejiwoka who allowed Ohonamuchi Sukuna Hikone to pay a nightly visit to her. The combined name refers to two deities, Ohonamuchi meaning "great land holder" and Sukuna Hikone meaning "small land holder." The princess kept food and such utensils as a food box on this hill. Therefore, the place came to be called Hakowoka (box hill).

Village of Ohono. Tohori is located in this village. The condition of the soil is about average. The place now called Ohono was once a vast barren field, and thus it gave rise to the name Ohono (vast field). During the reign of Prince Shima, who governed the realm from Shima Palace, posthumously known as Emperor Kimmei, Weta, the forebear of Murakami Tarushima, requested this area, reclaimed it, and stayed there. The village is still called Ohono.

Tohori was named after a site from which sandstone was dug. During the reign of Prince Homuda a road was built along the Ohokaha (great river), the boundary between the districts of Kamusaki and Shikama. At that time sandstone was dug from the site. Therefore, the place came to be called Tohori (sandstone-digging). The place still produces sandstone.

Village of Wogaha. This village includes the hamlets of Takase and Toyokuni, Agamano, Imesaki, Mayumisaka, Mitachiwoka, and Itoshima. The condition of the soil is about average. The former name of this village was Kisaki no Sato. Kisaki was named after the occupation of a man who belonged to the Kisaki-be (empress's corporate group). This man was Yumitsuka. His forebear was Hiru of the Tatari no Kimi, said to have been a descendant of a king of Kara. This Hiru of the Tatari no Kimi asked Prince Shima to grant him this land. His descendants were later made the Kisaki-be. That is why the village was called Kisaki in the past. In the year of Kanoye Tora (690), Councillor Kamitsu Keno renamed it Wogaha (small river). Councillor Kamitsu Keno was governor of Harima Province at that time.

According to another version, Wogaha was named after a small stream that flows from the field of Ohono to this area.

The hamlet of Takase was named after rapids in this area. When Prince Homuda was viewing the area from the top of Imesaki, he looked to the north and saw a white object moving in the distance. An attendant from Kamitsu Keno was sent to observe it more closely. In early Japan it was customary for local chieftains to send their young sons to the Yamato Court as a gesture of submission, and these boys often became loyal attendants. The attendant's name was Manahiko. Manahiko reported that it was rapids in a stream rushing down from the highlands. This is why it is called the hamlet of Takase (rapid water).

The hamlet of Toyokuni was named after the god Toyokuni in Tsukushi. The god Toyokuni resides in this hamlet. Thus, it is called Toyokuni.

Agamano was named after an incident involving one of Prince Homuda's horses. While hunting in this field, the prince happened to see one of his horses run away from the herd. Prince Homuda asked whose horse it was. "That is the horse of Aga Kimi (my lord)," said a gentleman-in-waiting. Thus, the place was named Agamano (field of my horse).

The place where the prince let his huntsmen shoot their arrows at that time was named Imesaki (target knoll). The name was later changed to Yumesaki. The place where one bow was broken was named Mayumi Woka (bow-tree hill). The hill on which the prince stood was named Mitachiwoka (observation hill). The shooting of the arrows caused a deer to emerge from the grove and jump into the sea. The deer swam to the opposite shore. That is why the islands were named Itoshima.

Village of Abo. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Abo was named after the native place of the people who settled in this area. They came from the hamlet of Abo in Iyo on Shikoku Island. That is why it is called the village of Abo.

Village of Mino. The village includes Tsugi no Minato. The condition of the soil is of the middle grade of the inferior class. Mino was named after the native place of the settlers of this area. They came from the district of Mino in Sanuki. It is therefore called Mino.

Tsugi no Minato was named after a man who possessed the extraordinary power of theurgy. Once upon a time, there was a dead woman in this area. A man came and restored her life. This man is said to have been the forebear of the Hi no Kimi in Tsukushi, but his name is not known. After restoring the dead woman to life, the man married her. That is why the place is called Tsugi no Minato (life-restoring haven).

Village of Idate. The condition of the soil is about average. Idate was named after the god Idate, a war god with the power to control seafaring, who resides in this village. When Princess Okinaga Tarashi desired to conquer Silla and mobilized her army to cross the sea, the god Idate guarded the fleet. Because of this god's presence, the village is called Idate.

Village of Anashi. The condition of the soil is about average. Anashi was named after the god Anashi in the Yamato region. The entire village of Anashi constitutes a kamube, or unit of shrine households, of the Anashi Shrine. That is why the village is called Anashi.

Village of Ayabe. The village includes the hamlets of Tashino, Ahino, and Tenugaha. The etymology of this name is the same as that given for the village of Ayabe above. It is inhabited by immigrants and their descendants.

Tashino was named after a gesture of Prince Homuda. When he came upon this area while on an inspection tour, Prince Homuda raised his whip to point to this field, and said, "This is a good field in which to build houses and cultivate." That is why the place is called Sashino (indicated field). The name has been altered to Tashino.

Ahino was named after the meeting of Prince Homuda and his subjects. While the prince approached from the hillside, his subjects, perhaps newly subjugated ones, arrived by sea. They met at this place. That is why the place is called Ahino (meeting field).

Tenugaha was named after a deed of Prince Homuda. While touring the area, the prince washed his hands in this river. That is why it is called Tenu (hand-wetting). Ayu are obtained there. They are very tasty.

There is a pond called Umahaka at the northern foot of Funawoka in the village of Iwa. In the past, during the reign of Prince Ohohatsuse, posthumously known as Emperor Yuryaku, there lived a man named Nagahiko, the forebear of the Wohari no Muraji. This man had a nice maid and a good horse, and he was very pleased with both. On his deathbed this man instructed his son regarding his funeral, following which his maid and his horse were expected to die in memory of their master. The man said, "After my death be sure to conduct all funerals in the same manner as mine." The son accordingly constructed three tombs: one for his own father, one for his father's maid, and one for his father's horse. Later, when Councillor Ofushi became governor of Harima Province, he built dikes around the horse's tomb. That is why the water around the tomb is called Umahaka no Ike (horse-tomb pond).

Shikama no Miyake. Shikama no Miyake (the royal granary of Shikama) was established by Prince Ohosasagi in this district. During his reign, Prince Ohosasagi ordered a subject to fetch the kuni no miyatsuko of five provinces: Oki, Izumo, Hahaki (Hoki), Inaba, and Tajima. These five magistrates forced the prince's messengers to act as pilots on their journey to the capital. The prince was greatly offended by this.

Because of their offense, the five magistrates were banished to Harima Province and confined to a prison workshop where they tilled the royal granary land. Their followers must have accompanied them. The prisoners reclaimed the prince's land. The rice fields thus created were named Okita (the rice field of Oki), Izumota, Hahakita, Inabata, and Tajimata. Since that time the Shikama no Miyake has collected and stored the yields of these rice fields for royal use. The granary is also called Kawaraku no Miyake (compensation granary).

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Ihibo

The etymological explanation is provided later in this section.

Ito Shima. This is the collective name for a group of islands. These islands were named after an incident that occurred while Prince Homuda was present. The prince conducted a hunting tour around the area. He then had his huntsmen shoot arrows at Imesaki of Shikama. Thereupon a doe, startled by the shot, emerged from Agamano. It passed the hill on which the prince stood and waded into the water.

The deer swam in the sea until it finally reached one of these islands. The huntsmen saw this and said to each other, "How very fast the deer is! It has already reached the island." These islands came to be known by the name of Ito.

Village of Kaguyama. The former name was Kakuhaka (deer-coming tomb). The condition of the soil is of the upper grade of the inferior class. The name Kakuhaka is a kind of name in which two things are combined: the shape of this hill actually looks like a burial mound, and legend tells us that while the Great God of Iwa occupied the area, a deer came and stood on top of this hill. It therefore came to be called Kakuhaka. Later, in the time of Provincial Governor Chimori no Omi, the name was changed to Kaguyama (fragrant hill).

Yanuchi Dani (or Yanuchi Tani). This is a dell in Kaguyama. Viewed from this small valley, the surrounding bluffs have the appearance of an enclosing fence. Therefore, it came to be known as Yanuchi Dani (courtyard dell).

Hamlet of Sasa. While on an inspection tour, Prince Homuda came upon this place and saw a monkey with a bamboo leaf in its mouth. The village was named Sasa after the bamboo leaf.

Hamlet of Atsu. At one time the Great God of Iwa made an inspection tour of this area. When he came to this hamlet he was suffering from heartburn. He broke the cord fastening his clothes in order to air his chest. That is how the place came to be called Atsu (burning hot).

Another theory suggests that the village got its name from an incident that occurred in the area. Long ago there were two stars shining in the sky. One day these stars fell to earth at this place and became two rocks. The villagers gathered around the site to determine what had happened to the stars. They had a heated discussion about these fallen stars. That is why the place is called Atsu (abridgment of agetsu, meaning "to discuss").

Ihimori Yama. Ihimori was named after the spouse of the meal god in the district of Utari in Sanuki. The goddess was called Ihimori no Ohotoji (meal-serving dame). She came from across the sea to live on this hill. Thus, it is called Ihimori (meal-serving).

Ohotori Yama. Large wild geese live on this hill. That is why it is called Ohotori (big bird).

Village of Kurusu. The condition of the soil is about average. Kurusu was named after a chestnut grove in this village. Prince Takatsu, posthumously known as Emperor Nintoku, who governed the realm from Takatsu Palace in Naniha, ordered some peeled chestnuts to be presented in his name to Ikeko of the Waka Yamatobe no Muraji. Ikeko thereupon retired from the Court to come to this place and plant the royal gifts in the village. The chestnut trees grew, and thus the hamlet was named Kurusu (chestnut grove). Chestnuts from this grove are said to be free of bitterness because the nuts were peeled before they were planted.

Kanaya Gaha (winding river). This river was named after one of Prince Homuda's arrows. When the prince was here on an inspection tour, one of his iron hunting arrows fell into the river. The incident gave rise to the name Kanaya (iron arrow).

Awi Yama. The mercury plant is obtained on this hill. Therefore, the hill is called Awi (mercury plant). It was during the reign of Prince Homuda that this plant was first found on the hill. Some unidentified birds come to stay there. They stay from the first to the fourth month. After the fifth month they fly away. The shape of the birds resembles that of doves, and their color is dark blue.

Village of Koshibe. The former name was Mikoshiro no Sato. The condition of the soil is about average. Mikoshiro was named after land given to the people who were settled in the village as royal serfs. During the reign of Prince Magari, posthumously known as Emperor Ankan, Wotsu of the Tajima no Kami was accorded princely favor and endowed with the title of Mikoshiro no Kimi (chief of the royal serfs). He was made supervisor of the royal granary, which was newly established in this village. That is why the place was called the hamlet of Mikoshiro.

Later, when Councillor Kamitsu Keno was governor of Harima Province, this hamlet grew and the number of households increased to as many as thirty. Therefore, Councillor Kamitsu Keno grouped the thirty households together and called the resulting unit Koshibe (surplus households). That is why it is now called Koshibe no Sato (village composed of surplus households).

According to another version, the residents in this area came from a miyake in the land of Tajima to settle in the hamlet, hence the name Koshibe (relocated people).

Sagisumi Yama. Sagisumi was named for the numerous herons that once came to this hill. Thus Sagisumi (heron-living) became the name of the hill.

Tanakura Yama. The rocks of this hill are piled up like shelves. Therefore, the hills are called Tanakura (shelves).

Mihashi Yama. The god Ohonamuchi piled bags of rice here in order to make stairs. In fact, the rocks on this hillside are piled up in such a way that they look like stairs. That is why the hill was named Mihashi (august stairs).

Hamlet of Sano. The forebear of Tamate of the Wake no Kimi was originally from Izumo District in Kahachi Province. His birthplace, however, was not a desirable place to live, so he decided to move. When Tamate arrived here in search of good land, he said, "This land is rather narrow but it looks like a good place for me to settle." Thus, it was named Sano (narrow field).

Village of Kami Woka. The old name was Hayashida no Sato. The condition of the soil is slightly below average. Kami Woka was named after a deed of the Great God Abo from Izumo. This god heard that three hills in Yamato -- Unebi, Kagu, and Miminashi -- were fighting each other for supremacy. The Great God Abo, wishing to intercede, set out for Yamato. When the god reached this area, he learned that the three contenders had already stopped fighting. Learning of the peace settlement among the three, the Great God Abo saw no need to proceed further. He capsized the boat in which he was travelling and decided to stay. The site of the capsized boat is called Kami Woka (god's hill). The shape of this hill really looks like a capsized boat.

Sugafu Yama. Sedge grows all around this hill. This gave rise to the name Sugafu Yama (sedge-growing hill). According to another tradition, it was named after words Prince Homuda uttered while he was on an inspection tour in the area. The prince ordered a well dug at the foot of the hill. The water of the well was very clear and cold. After drinking this good water, Prince Homuda said, "My mind is refreshed by this clear, chilled water." That is how the place came to be called Sugafu (richly refreshing).

Tono Woka. A palace was built on this hill. Thus, it is called Tono Woka (palace hill). Oak trees grow there.

Village of Kusakabe. The village is named after a man's surname. The condition of the soil is about average.

Tachino. The former name was Kusakabeno. In the past, Nomi no Sukune, a fashioner of clay images for funerals, was returning home from Yamato to the land of Izumo. He spent the night at Kusakabeno where he became ill and eventually died. Upon his death, the people of Izumo were summoned. They came from Izumo, formed a line from the riverbed of Ihibo Gaha to Kusakabeno, and passed pebbles by relay from the river to the burial site. There they constructed a burial mound using these pebbles. Because the people of Izumo lined up around Kusakabeno to construct a tomb, the area came to be called Tachino (standing field). The grave itself is called Izumo no Hakaya (Izumo tomb).

Village of Hayashida. The former name was Ihanashi. The condition of the soil is slightly below average. When he came to this land for the first time, the Great God of Iwa stuck a twig into the ground at this site to mark it as his territory. The twig grew tall and became an imposing elm tree. That is why the place used to be called Ihanashi (elm tree).

Matsuwo Woka. When Prince Homuda arrived at this hill on an inspection tour, the sun set and darkness fell. He collected pine branches from the hill and made a torch. That is why the place came to be called Matsuwo (pine's tail).

Shiho Woka. There is a spring on the south side of this hill. It is about thirty feet square. The site of the spring is about ten miles from the seashore, yet the water is salty and it rises and falls with the tide. At high tide, the water is about three inches deep. Pebbles line the bottom and grass grows on the edge. Animals such as bovines, horses, and deer are fond of this water. Because the water contains salt, the hill is called Shiho Woka (salt hill).

Iseno. Ise was named after two guardian deities of the newcomers who came to this area. These deities are Isetsuhiko and Isetsuhime, the god and goddess of Ise, children of the Great God of Iwa. The suffix hiko connotes the masculine and hime the feminine. Every time newcomers attempted to settle in this area they would suffer great misfortune. The immigrant families, however, wanted to stay. These were the forebears of Ite of the Kinunuhi (dressmakers) and Tora of the Ayahito and their people. Because they desired to settle in this area, they built a shrine to the two deities of Ise at the foot of this hill. After consecrating the shrine of these deities, the newcomers prospered and the number of their households increased. Thus originated the name Ise.

Ise Gaha. The river was named after the Ise deities.

Inadane Yama. The two deities, Ohonamuchi and Sukuna Hikone, were on the ridge of Ikuno in the village of Hani Woka, of Kamusaki District, when they looked upon these hills and said, "Lo, those hills would be a good place to store rice stalks." They sent for rice stalks and had them piled up there. The shape of these hills is like rice stalks piled high. That is why they are called Inatane Yama (rice stalk hills).

Village of Ohochi (Posting-Station). The condition of the soil is slightly below average. Ohochi was named for the words of Prince Homuda. When the prince came upon this place while on an inspection tour, he commented on this land, saying, "Though I imagined it as a narrow land, this is indeed a large tract of enclosed land." Because of this, it is named Ohouchi (large enclosed land).

Hiyama. There was once a spring on the east side of this hill. When Prince Homuda attempted to ladle water from this spring, it was frozen over. That is why the hill was named Hiyama (freezing hill).

Tsukiwore Yama. Prince Homuda went hunting on this hill. He attempted to shoot a running boar with his bow made from a zelkova tree. However, the bow snapped before the arrow could be launched. The incident gave rise to the name Tsukiwore Yama (zelkova-breaking, or bow-snapping, hill). There is a rock cavern on the south side of this hill. Cattail grows inside the cave. Thus, the place is called Kama Woka (cattail hill). The cattail has never ceased to grow there.

Village of Hiroyama. The former name was the hamlet of Tsuka. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Tsuka was named for a deed of the goddess Ihatatsu-Hime. This deity stood in the grove of Hatawi, in the hamlet of Izumi, and shot arrows in several directions. All the arrows she shot toward this place stuck deep in the ground, with only the ends protruding. The part protruding was about as long as a man's fist. Therefore, the place was called the hamlet of Tsuka (fist). The name was changed to the village of Hiroyama when Prince Ishikaha was serving as the commissioner of this area.

Asauchi Yama. Once upon a time, Marahi of the Izushi no Kimi, a resident of Tajima, lived on this hill. Two women from this man's household died one night while beating hemp. They died with beaten hemp on their chests, giving rise to the name Asauchi Yama (hemp-beating hill). The name carries a double meaning, for asa can mean both "hemp" and "morning." Today the residents around this hill never beat hemp after nightfall.

Oshi Kaha. It was during the reign of Prince Homuda that the Great Goddess Mikage of Izumo resided in Kamiwo Yama at the village of Hirakata. She harassed travellers in this area, killing half of them and sparing half. Three men -- Kohote of Hahaki (Hoki), Fukuro of Inaba, and Tsukiya of Izumo -- discussed the matter and appealed to the royal court for help. Kutoto of the Nukatabe no Muraji was sent by Prince Homuda to offer prayers to appease the goddess. Kutoto constructed an altar for prayer at Yakatada and established a winery at Sasa Yama for the ceremony. People feasted and enjoyed the occasion. They decorated their waists with oak leaves and walked down to the river jostling each other. This ritual gave rise to the name Oshi (pushing).

Village of Hirakata. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Hirakata was named after the native place of the people who settled in this area. Immigrants from Hirakata village in Mamuta District, which is in Kahachi Province, settled here first. Thus, the place was named Hirakata.

Sahi Woka. Sahi was named for the sahi (plough) that was made for sacrificial use to appease the violent deity of this area. The Great Goddess of Izumo, who is now enshrined at Kamiwo Yama, was quite violent at one time. Whenever travellers from Izumo passed through the area, this goddess killed half of them: five out of ten, three out of five. The Izumo immigrants made a plough to dedicate to the goddess in an attempt to appease her. The plough, however, was ineffective; the goddess was not appeased.

There is a reason why the goddess of Izumo was so spiteful toward Izumo men. In the remote past, a god of Izumo came to this place. His goddess followed him. The male deity was disturbed by her appearance in his new land and he deserted her. The female deity was so enraged that she determined to harm the Izumo people in reprisal. Later, immigrants from the village of Hirakata, of Mamuta District in Kahachi Province, came to the foot of this hill. These people respectfully prayed to the goddess, begging for a peace settlement, and finally they were successful. Because the goddess resides here, the hill is called Kamiwo (goddess's feet). Sahi Woka was named for the ineffective plough that the Izumo people dedicated to the goddess.

Sawoka. Sawoka was named after the annual rice-planting festival held there. During his reign, Prince Takatsu sent for peasants from Tsukushi to create rice fields in this area. Every year in the fifth month the farmers would gather around this hill for a feast celebrating the annual rice-planting ritual. That is why the hill is called Sawoka (rice-planting hill).

Ohomi Yama. Ohomi was named for a deed of Prince Homuda. The prince climbed to the top of this hill so that he could see in all four directions. This is why it is called Ohomi (grand viewing). The prince stood on a huge boulder about three feet tall, thirty feet long, and twenty feet wide. Some concave spots on the stone are said to be his footprints and the traces of his walking stick.

Misaki Yama. Three promontories protrude northward from this hill. They are so conspicuous that people began to call the place Misaki Yama (three-forked hill).

Mitachi Woka. Prince Homuda went to the top of this hill to view his country. Thus, it was named Mitachi Woka (noble-standing hill).

Village of Ohoyake. Its former name was Ohomiya. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. When he came to this area on an inspection tour, Prince Homuda built his palace in this village. That is why it was named Ohomiya (grand palace). Later, Councillor Tanaka changed its name to Ohoyake (great mansion) when he was the governor of Harima Province.

Ohonori Yama. The present name is Suguribe Woka. Prince Homuda promulgated an important code on this hill. This is how the hill came to be called Ohonori (grand code). The reason why it is now called Suguribe Woka is as follows. During her reign, Princess Kahara of Woharita, posthumously known as Empress Suiko, commissioned the Suguribe people of Chiyo, in Yamato, to reclaim the area. The Suguribe, who were from Paekche, settled at the foot of this hill. Because they lived in this area, the hill is also called Suguribe Woka.

Kamihako Woka, Shimohako Woka, Nahetsu, and Afukota. During the reign of Prince Uji, the Takanashi brothers, who were the forebears of the Uji no Muraji, asked that the place called Yofuto, in the hamlet of Ohotabe, be given to them. The land was granted by Prince Uji. When the Takanashi brothers arrived to reclaim the land, one of their servants carried the cooking utensils by means of a pole on his shoulder.

When the servant arrived at this place, the pole broke and the utensils fell to the ground. Thus, the place where the pans dropped was named Nahetsu (destination of the pan). Likewise, the place where the box attached to the front of the pole fell was named Kamihako Woka (front-box hill). The place where the box attached to the back of the pole dropped was called Shimohako Woka (back-box hill). The place where the pole fell was named Afukota (pole land).

Village of Ohota. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Ohota was named after the hamlet of Ohota where Korean immigrants settled. In ancient times, Suguri of Kure came from Kara (the southern Korean Peninsula) to settle in the hamlet of Ohota of Nagusa District in the land of Ki. Sometime later, a branch of this family moved to the village of Ohota of Kami in Settsu. From here, still another branch moved to the hamlet of Ohota of Ihibo District. Because the original Suguri family had settled in a place called Ohota, their branch families also called their farmland Ohota. The name Kure is an archaic Korean word meaning "the cultured," referring to China or the Chinese.

Kotoage Woka. Kotoage was named for the words of Princess Okinaga Tarashi. When she was about to dispatch her army to fight in the area, the princess gathered her troops on this hill and gave them instructions. She said, "This war should be carried out stealthily. It must not be declared beforehand." Thus, the place came to be known as Kotoage Saki (prior declaration hill).

Tsudzumi Yama. Long ago, Ise of the Nukatabe no Muraji fought Tamo of the Hara, who was a miwabito (a wizard or theurgist affiliated with a shrine) at this place. They began their battles with the beating of drums. Thus, the hill was named Tsudzumi (drum-sounding hill). The spindle tree grows in the valley below this hill.

Village of Ihami. The condition of the soil is excellent. Ihami was named after the native place of the laborers who opened this area. During the reign of the emperor posthumously known as Emperor Kotoku who governed the realm from Toyosaki Palace at Nagara in Naniha, an unusually bountiful crop of rice grew in the vast field of this village. Momotari of the Azumi no Muraji harvested the crop and dedicated it to the emperor. Thereupon, the emperor issued an edict, declaring, "It is fitting to reclaim this land and make it into a rice field." Thus, the emperor commissioned Tamu of the Adzumi no Muraji to recruit laborers from Ihami Province. That is why the village came to be called Ihami, and the rice field Momotari.

Sakawino. Sakawi was named after a well dug for a sake brewery. Prince Homuda constructed a palace in the village of Ohoyake, dug a well, and established a sake brewery in this field. Therefore, the place was named Sakawino (field of the rice-wine well).

Usukitsu. Princess Okinaga Tarashi came upon this place while she was en route to an overseas campaign in Kara. She anchored her fleet overnight in the sheltered mouth of the Uzu River. From this haven she proceeded toward Itsu. On the way to Itsu the fleet encountered an adverse wind and could not proceed. Under the circumstances the princess decided to drag the boats across the place called Funakoshi and continue overland. But the wind was so strong that the boats could not be pulled. The princess then mobilized the local peasants to help pull the boats. Among them was a woman who was eager to present her son to the princess as a servant. This woman was in such haste to reach the princess that she fell into the water. That is why the ford is called Usukitsu (ford of making haste). Today, the Japanese say isusuku to mean "make haste."

Uzu Gaha (swirling river). Uzu was named after swirling waves on the west side of Usukitsu. Princess Okinaga Tarashi anchored her fleet at one of the fords of this river.

Hamlet of Itsu. Itsu was named for words spoken by the princess's sailors, who said, "Itsu (how soon) can we return to see this place again?" That is why the village is called Itsu (when, or how soon).

Suzume Shima (sparrow island). This island was so named because a large number of sparrows gather there. No plants grow there.

Village of Urakami. The condition of the soil is about average. Urakami was named after the birthplace of Momotari of the Azumi no Muraji. Formerly this man resided at Urakami of Naniha. He later moved to this area. Thus, the place came to be known by the name of the man's place of origin, Urakami.

Mitsu. This place provided shelter to the fleet of Princess Okinaga Tarashi. That is why it is called Mitsu (honored anchorage).

Murofu no Tomari (shelter of Murofu). This shelter is so situated that wind is prevented from blowing in. It prevents drafts in the manner of a cellar. It is therefore called Murofu no Tomari (shelter like a cellar).

Ofu no Ura. In ancient times ofu (white clams) were obtained there. It therefore is called Ofu no Ura (white-clam beach).

Ihe Shima. Quite a few people live on these islands and there are many houses there. That is why they are called Ihe Shima (house islands). Bamboo and arrowroot grow there.

Kami Shima. This island is located east of Ito Shima. Kami Shima was named after a stone statue of a deity located on the west side of this island. It is shaped like an image of the Buddha. The island got its name of Kami Shima (deity island) from this stone deity. There are five different-colored jewels set into the face of this image. Several other jewels are set into its chest. It looks as though the deity is crying, shedding colored tears on its face and chest. One might well wonder why the image looks as if it is crying. Naturally, there is a story behind it, as follows.

During the reign of Prince Homuda, a visitor from Silla came to his Court. The visitor saw this statue and reckoned the jewels to be priceless. He crushed the face in order to remove one of the eyes, severely damaging it. The stone deity was enraged at this act and caused a violent wind to rise. Shipwrecked, the visitor's boat drifted toward the south shore of Taka Shima where it sank. All the passengers were drowned. The dead were buried on the beach. Thus, the beach was named Kara Hama (Korean beach). Today, those who pass through this area are careful not to mention the people of Kara or those who are blind, perhaps because the stone deity was blinded.

Karani Shima. The belongings of the people drowned in the above-mentioned shipwreck drifted to the shore of this island. It therefore was named Karani Shima (Korean cargo island).

Taka Shima. This island is higher than the others in this area. It therefore is called Taka Shima (tall island).

Village of Hagihara. The condition of the soil is about average. Hagihara was named after the bush clover, called hari in archaic Japanese. Princess Okinaga Tarashi was on her way home from her expeditionary campaign in Kara. She had her fleet anchor at the shore of this village. During the night the bush clover grew as tall as ten feet. That is why the village was named Hagihara (bush-clover field). Observing this unusual phenomenon, the princess and her subjects dug a well near the bush clover and ordered that the space around the clover and the well be left untouched. That is why the well is called Harimawi (well in an unreclaimed tract).

The well was built in the Korean style with a barrel installed in which underground water could collect. Because the well was Korean in style, people gave it the alternate name of Kara Shimizu (Korean water). The water of this well was abundant, accumulating day and night. The princess had a sake brewery built nearby. This site was named Sakata (sake field). Once one of the brewery barrels overturned and was emptied. Thus, the place came to be called Katabukita (overturned field).

Near the brewery site was a place where young girls processed sake by crushing rice. The princess's subjects married these maidens. Thus, the place was named Hototachita (first-night field). Around Hototachita bush clover grew abundantly. Thus, the area came to be called Hagihara. The deity enshrined there is Sukuna Tarashi.

Suzukuhi Woka. This hill is called Suzukuhi Woka because of one of Prince Homuda's hunting trips in the area. During his reign, Prince Homuda engaged in falconry on this hill. The hill was named after an incident in which one of his falcons dropped its bell to the ground. The bell was never found despite an earnest search -- thus, the name Suzukuhi Woka (bell-eating hill).

Village of Woyake. The former name was Ayabe no Sato. The condition of the soil is the middle grade of the inferior class. Ayabe was so named because immigrants lived in this village. The name was later changed to Woyake. The reason for the change is as follows. The grandfather of Wakasa, of the Kahara family, married a daughter of the Hata no Kimi of Woyake and named his house Woyake. Later, Chimaro, the grandson of Wakasa, was elevated to the position of head of the village. Upon this, the village was named Woyake. The event took place in the year of Kanoye Tora (690).

Shitadami Gaha. Shitadami was named after the small clams once found in this river. Farmers dug irrigation ditches for the rice fields in this area. There were a large number of small, fresh-water clams in the ditches. The ditches later formed a small river. Thus, the river was named Shitadami (small clams).

Village of Ihibo. The condition of the soil is about average. Ihibo was named after the hill in this village. Because the hill is called Ihibo Yama (rice-grain hill), the village came to be called Ihibo no Sato (village of rice grains).

Ihibo Woka. Ihibo was named after the rice dropped atop this hill. When he arrived from Kara (Korea), Ame no Hihoko (Prince of the Shining Halberd) asked Ashihara no Shikowo (Ugly Man in the Reed Field) to give him shelter at the mouth of the Uzu River. Ame no Hihoko represents newcomers to this area, while Ashihara no Shikowo represents the local people already settled there.

"I wish to find a place where I can stay the night," said the Prince of the Shining Halberd. "You are the lord of this land. Provide me with a shelter." However, Ugly Man in the Reed Field did not allow the prince to come ashore. Thereupon, the prince god stirred the sea with his sword to form a whirlpool and sat on top of it. After witnessing this valorous feat, the Ugly Man became afraid of the prince. He saw that he must secure his priority over the area. He therefore climbed to the top of Ihibo Woka and ate some rice, for to partake of a meal was felt to have a magical effect on the ability to control land. In so doing, he dropped a few grains of rice from his mouth. That is how the hill came to be called Ihibo (grain of rice). All the pebbles on this hill resemble grains of rice.

In the meantime, the native god stuck his walking stick into the ground. Water sprang from the spot and began flowing north and south. The northern stream is cold, and the southern stream is warm. The wokera plant, a medicinal herb, grows there.

Kami Yama. There is a stone statue of a deity on this hill. Therefore, the place is called Kami Yama (god's hill). Pasania trees grow there. Pasania nuts grow during the eighth month.

Village of Izumi. There is a cold spring in this village. The village is identified with this spring and therefore is called Izumi. The condition of the soil is about average.

Minashi Gaha. Minashi was named after the outcome of a water fight between two deities in this area. The god Ihatatsu and the goddess Ihatatsu, children of the great god of Iwa, fought over the water of this river. The brother god wanted the river to flow north toward the village of Koshibe, while the sister god wanted to direct it south toward the village of Izumi. The male deity broke off the ridge of the hill so that the river would flow north. Upon seeing this the goddess, thinking her brother's conduct unreasonable, used her magical comb to block the water and dig a ditch, directing the river southward toward the village of Izumi. Thus, their quarrel continued.

The male deity then went around to the south side of the village of Izumi and devised a scheme to make the water flow toward the hamlet of Kuhahara in the west. But the goddess never capitulated. She constructed an underground water pipe so that more of the river water reached the rice field belonging to the hamlet of Izumi. Because of this, the original river dried up. Therefore, it is called Minashi, meaning "waterless."

Village of Kuhahara. The former name of the village was Kurami. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. When he stood atop Tsukiwore Yama to view the surrounding territory, Prince Homuda saw the tall granary buildings that belonged to him. He therefore named the village Kurami (granary-viewing). The name has since been altered to Kuhahara.

There is another version of this etymology. According to the elders, members of the Kuhahara no Suguri stole saddles in the district of Sayo. The owner of the saddles followed and accused them of the theft when they came to this village. Thus, the place was called Kurami (saddle-revealing).

Koto Saka. Koto Saka was named for a zither that was played there. During the reign of Prince Ohotarashi a traveller from Izumo rested at the pass on this hill. While resting, he heard about an old man who made his living tilling rice fields with his daughter at the foot of the hill. The Izumo visitor wished to win the girl's heart, and he serenaded her with his koto (zither). Therefore, the pass was named Koto Saka (zither pass). The site produces copper-bearing rocks shaped like the dice used to play sugoroku.

## District of Sayo

Sayo was named for the season of rice planting. When the two great deities, the Great God and the Great Goddess Tamatsuhime, competed, expanding their territories, the goddess slaughtered a deer, opened its bowels, and sowed rice seeds in the blood to obtain fast-growing seedlings. The seedlings sprouted overnight. The goddess then transplanted them. This act signified her victory over the great god. It was the fifth month of the year.

"You have indeed transplanted the seedlings during the sayo (the evening in this early season)," said the great god. He thus acknowledged that he had been defeated by the goddess's advanced farming techniques, and he left for another place. His words gave rise to the name Sayo. Sayo later came to mean "a night in the fifth month." Thus, the district was named Sayo.

Likewise, the goddess acquired a new name, Sayotsuhime (beauty of Sayo). Even today, there is a Sayo no Machida (oracle rice field) in this district. The hill where the deer was slaughtered was named Kaniha Yama (deer's garden). There are twelve dales on the four sides of this hill, from which iron ore can be obtained. Inu, of the Wakebe family, discovered the iron. It was this Inu's grandson who began the custom of presenting iron to the court of the emperor posthumously known as Emperor Kotoku who governed the realm from Toyosaki Palace in Naniha.

Village of Sayo. The etymology of this village's name is the same as that of the district. The condition of the soil is excellent.

Yegaha. The former name was Tamaochi Gaha (jewel-dropping river). The great god once dropped his jewel into this river. Thus, it was named Tamaochi (jewel-dropping). Today it is called Yegaha because Oho Yegaha of the Inasabe once lived in the village. The Japanese gold-thread plant grows on the hill of this village.

Kurami. The Great Goddess Sayo produced iron saddles on the hill of this area. Therefore, the hill was named Kanakura (iron saddle) and the river was named the Kurami (saddle-revealing).

Ishi (Stream). This is the upper part of the Kurami River. The riverbed is as smooth as the surface of a bench. Thus, it is called Ishi (bench). False goatsbeard grows on this hill.

Village of Hayase (rapid water). The condition of the soil is excellent. The village was so named because of the rapids in this area. The goddess that presides at the Hayase Shrine is Hiro, the younger sister of the Great Goddess Sayo.

Kohorino. When the goddess Hiro occupied this area, it was frozen. Thus, the hill was named Kohorino (frozen hill) and the dale was named Kohori Tani (frozen dale).

Village of Oho. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. While he was in this village, Prince Mima dug a well, ate some dried rice, and said, "I have acquired a lot of land now." His words gave rise to the name Oho (plenty). The spot where the prince dug the well was named Miwi (august well).

Kuhaye Gaha. Kamuhiko (Prince of the Divine Nature) obtained a handle for his plough from the hill in this area. The river flowing from this hill therefore was named Kuhaye (plough handle).

Murofu Yama. This hill protects the area surrounding it in much the same way as a cellar prevents the wind from blowing in. This is why it was named Murofu. Ginseng, udo, mercury, false goatsbeard, and wokera are obtained there. This hill also produces limestone.

Kuzuno. Prince Mima said, "This hill would be crushed if I stepped on it." Thus, it was named Kuzuno (crumbling hill). The name was later changed to Uno. On the four sides of this area there are low hills and at the center there is a flat field.

Village of Kashihahara. Oak trees grow abundantly in this village. Therefore, it was named Kashihahara (oak-leaf field).

Uheto (River). When he came from Izumo, the great god chose as his bench a hill in the village of Shima, sat upon it, and set a fish trap in this river. The river, named after the god's fish trap, was called Uheto, meaning "fish-trapping." But no fish were caught in the trap. Instead a deer became trapped in it. The great god prepared the deer meat as namasu, a dish of sliced raw meat. As the god was about to eat, he dropped the first piece before he could put it into his mouth. He interpreted this as a bad omen and immediately left for another place.

Village of Nakatsugaha. The condition of the soil is very good. Nakatsugaha was named after a man called Oho Naka (Great Naka), the forebear of the Toma no Obito (chieftain of the straw-mat makers). On her way to Kara (Korea), Princess Okinaga Tarashi anchored her fleet at Ihaya, a port of Ahaji Shima (Ahaji island). At that time a heavy rainstorm soaked everything. The princess's soldiers were drenched. Oho Naka devised makeshift huts, using straw mats, in which the soldiers took shelter. The princess, who was very pleased by his ingenuity, said, "This man is indeed valuable to our country." Thus, she gave Oho Naka a kabane (title), calling him Toma no Obito. After that the man and his family settled in this village. The river in this area was named Nakatsugaha (the river of Naka) after this man. The village was named after the river.

In the past, during the reign of the emperor posthumously known as Emperor Tenji, who held his court at Ohotsu in Afumi, there was a man named Sonafu of the Wanibe. He was a resident of Nakatsugaha. Sonafu bought a sword from a resident of Tonoki in Kahachi Province. After he obtained the sword, all the members of his family died one after another.

Later, a man named Inuwi of the Tomamibe unearthed a sword while tilling a rice field. The sword was found under the topsoil at the site of Sonafu's former homestead. It was lying in a hole about a foot in diameter. The handle of the sword was decayed but its blade was not tarnished and it still shone like a mirror. The man thought this strange and sent for a blacksmith to temper the blade. When it was put to the fire, the sword wriggled like a snake. The astonished blacksmith refused to temper it. Inuwi then realized that the sword had a divine nature and he presented it to the Court. The sword was accepted by the Court.

Many years later, in the seventh month of the year of Kinoye Saru (684), during the reign of the emperor posthumously known as Emperor Tenmu who had his court at Kiyomihara, Maro of the Sone no Muraji was commissioned to return the sword to its original place. Today the sword is kept at the miyake (royal granary) in this village of Nakatsugaha.

Funahiki Yama. Chimori no Omi was appointed governor of Harima Province during the reign of the emperor posthumously known as Emperor Tenji who held his court in Afumi. Chimori constructed an official ship on this hill. When the ship was finished, he had it slid down the hill to the sea. That is why the hill is called Funahiki (boat-pulling).

Kasasagi (idle chatterers) live on this hill. They are also called Korean crows. These birds live in the hollows of dead trees and are seen in spring but not in the summer. Ginseng and wild ginger grow there. At the foot of this hill there are five damson plum trees, which bear fruit until midwinter.

Mikazuki Hara. During the reign of Prince Takatsu, posthumously known as Emperor Nintoku, who governed the realm from Takatsu Palace in Naniha, there were two men whose extravagance was such that they washed their feet with fine wine. These men were Kaguro of Hahaki and Oyuko of Inaba. The Court considered their conduct excessive and disrespectful, and it dispensed Sayo of the Sawi no Muraji to summon them. Sayo arrested all the members of the two households and began the journey back to the capital. En route Sayo tortured his prisoners by plunging them into water.

Among these prisoners were two women who wore jewels on their wrists and ankles. Sayo thought that these women must be persons of some consequence, so he asked about their background. In answer to Sayo's inquiry the women said, "We are Una and Kuha, the daughters of Miso of the Hatori no Muraji and his wife Princess Arasaka. As you may know, our mother is a daughter of the kuni no miyatsuko of Inaba."

Sayo was astonished. He said, "Then you must be the daughters of one of the most influential persons at Court!" Immediately he released the women. The place where they were released was named Mi-oki Yama (farewell hill), and the place where Sayo tortured his prisoners was named Mikazuki Hara (soaking field).

Village of Uno. The condition of the soil is excellent. The god Tamatarashi, the son of the great god, fathered Prince Ohoiha by his wife, goddess Tamatarashi. Prince Ohoiha was very submissive to his father's wishes. The place was named Uno (in agreement, or harmony) after this filial son.

Hamlet of Shihonuma. Salt water flows from the ground in this hamlet. That is why it is called Shihonuma (salt marsh).

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Shisaha

Shisaha was named after an experience of the Great God of Iwa. After he finished founding his land, the god embarked upon an inspection tour of the hills, rivers, and valleys to determine the boundaries of his territory. While on this tour he met a huge deer at the hamlet of Yata. This deer was holding its tongue out as it walked. The god declared, "An arrow is hidden under this animal's tongue." The district was named Shisaha, an abbreviated form of shishiaha, meaning "to have met with deer." The hamlet in which he saw the deer was named Yata (arrow field).

Village of Hii. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Hiji was named after a man who became the village headman of this area. During the reign of the emperor posthumously known as Emperor Kotoku who governed the realm from Toyosaki Palace at Nagara in Naniha, the government divided Ihibo District in two and established Shisaha District. At that time Hiji of the Yamabe was appointed village headman. The village is known as Hiji after this man's given name.

Hamlet of Uhara. When he occupied this area, the Ugly Man in the Reed Field said, "This place is so small that it looks like the door of a cellar." Thus, it was named Uhato (front door).

Hamlet of Hirami. The great god dropped his belt in this hamlet. It therefore was named Hirabi (belt). Today people call it Hirami.

Hamlet of Kahato. The Prince of the Shining Spear stayed in this hamlet. While he was there he said, "The river is very noisy." Thus, the hamlet was named Kahato (sounding river).

Hamlet of Nihato. The former name was Nihaki. The great god once travelled through this village carrying some rice. The rice happened to get wet. Finding some mold on his rice, the god decided to make wine out of it. When the wine was ready the god dedicated it to the spirits of this land and feasted with his followers there. That is how the place came to be called Nihaki (wine-dedicating garden). Today people call it Nihato.

Ubahi Tani. Ugly Man in the Reed Field and the Prince of the Shining Spear fought each other for possession of this area. The contenders struggled by grappling in a valley. As a result, the shape of the valley was greatly distorted. It looks like a series of twisted vines. Because the deities grappled over this place, it is called Ubahi Tani (grappling ravine).

Inatsuki Mine. The great god had his followers pound rice on the ridge of this hill. That is why the hill was named Inatsuki Saki, meaning "rice-pounding promontory." Tasty chestnuts grow there. The place where the bran of the pounded rice fell was named Nuka Saki (rice-bran promontory).

Village of Takaya. The condition of the soil is the middle grade of the inferior class. Takaya was named after the words of the Prince of the Shining Spear. He said, "This village exceeds all the other villages of this area in height." That is why the place is called Takaya (higher houses).

Tsuda Gaha. No one was able to provide its etymology.

Hamlet of Shiho. The water obtained in this hamlet contains salt. That is why the hamlet is called Shiho (salt). Cattle love to drink this water.

Village of Kashihano. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Kashihano was named for the oak trees growing in this area. That is why it is called Kashihano (oak-leaf field).

Inaka Gaha. When the Ugly Man in the Reed Field and the Prince of the Shining Spear contended for this land, they happened to see a horse crying by the side of this river. So the river was named Inaku (neighing). Today people call it Inaka.

Hamlet of Hijima. The great god's garment fell to the ground in this hamlet. Thus, it was named Hijima (mud-getting land).

Hamlet of Shikikusa. The seat of the great god was prepared at this place. It was made of grass. Therefore, the place is called Shikikusa (grass carpet). There is a hill in this hamlet. About three miles from this village is a marsh, which is about 2,500 feet in circumference. Sedge grows in this marsh. The sedge grass of this marshland makes the best hats. Also growing there are cypress, Richard bald cypress, chestnut, Japanese gold-thread, and vines. Iron ore is obtained there. Wolves and bears live there.

Ihibe Woka. The great god who occupied this area prepared his meal atop this hill. Thus, the hill came to be called Ihibe (cooking stove). The shape of the three peaks of this hill resembles those of a rice steamer, a winnow, and a cooking stove.

Village of Anashi. The former name was the village of Suka. The condition of the soil is slightly above average. The great god had his meal at this village. Therefore, it was named Suka (eating). The name was later changed to Yamamori (mountain keeper) because Mima of the Yamabe was made village headman. The name was changed again; at present, it is Anashi. Anashi was named after Anashi Gaha, and the river was named after the goddess Anashi.

The Great God of Iwa wished to court this goddess Anashi but she repeatedly refused to see him. The god became so angry that he blocked the flow of the river by piling up pebbles at its source. Thus, the river changed its course and flowed in the direction of Mikata. That is why Anashi Gaha is very small. Cypress, Richard bald cypress, and vines grow on the hill of this village. Wolves and bears also live there.

Village of Ishitsukuri. The former name was Iwa. The condition of the soil is the middle grade of the inferior class. The Ishitsukuri no Obito lived in this village. That is why the village was named Ishitsukuri in the year of Kanoye Uma (670).

Ikama Gaha. When the great god occupied this land, he found squid in the river. Thus, it was named Ikama (squid-living).

Village of Uruka. The condition of the soil is the lowest grade of the inferior class. Konohana Sakuyahime, the wife of the great god, was very beautiful. That is why the village was named Uruka (beautiful).

Hamlet of Haka. When he contended with the Great God of Iwa, the Prince of the Shining Spear arrived at this place ahead of the great god. The great god was very alarmed, and said, "I did not expect him to arrive before me, but he beat me there!" Thus, the place was named Haka, by adopting the first two syllables of the word hakarazu (not expecting). It always rains when someone comes to this place without washing his limbs. Cypress, Richard bald cypress, spindle tree, vines, and horseradish grow on the hills of this village. Wolves and bears also live there.

Village of Mikata. The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior class. The Ugly Man in the Reed Field and the Prince of the Shining Spear arrived at Shini Take (Shini dale) where the soil is black. With his toe each of them tossed three pieces of vine to determine his territory, a kind of tossing game still popular among Korean children. A piece of the Ugly Man's vine landed in Keta District of Tajima Province. Another piece landed in Yafu District of Tajima Province, and the third piece fell in this village. That is why the village was named Mikata (the third piece). All three pieces tossed by the Prince of the Shining Spear landed in Tajima Province. Therefore, the Prince of the Shining Spear occupied Izushi District of Tajima Province.

According to another theory, Mikata was named for a deed of the great god who planted his mace as a symbol of his presence in this village. Thus, the village came to be called Mikata (respectful figure).

Ohouchi Gaha, Wouchi Gaha, and Kanauchi Gaha. The big river is called Ohouchi (great space), the small one is called Wouchi (small space), and the one that produces iron sand is called Kanauchi (iron-containing). Cypress, Richard bald cypress, and vines grow on the hill that is the source of these three rivers. Wolves and bears also live there.

Hamlet of Iwa. The former name was Miwa. The great god brewed rice wine in this hamlet. Therefore, it was named Miwa (divine wine). The hamlet was also called Owa. After founding this land, the great god said, "I have finished my work. I shall keep this as the place where my coffin will rest."

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Kamusaki

Kamusaki was named after Kamusaki Yama in the hamlet of Yamasaki. Prince Take Ihashiki, the son of the Great God of Iwa, resides on this hill. Because of this, the district was named Kamusaki (god's territory).

Village of Haniwoka. It includes the hamlets of Ikuno, Ohokahachi, Yukaha, Ahaka-kahachi, and Hajika. The condition of the soil is the lowest grade of the inferior class. Haniwoka was named after the clay carried by the god Sukuna Hikone in his contest of strength with the Ohonamuchi. Sukuna Hikone said, "Which do you think would be more difficult on a journey: to carry a load of clay or to proceed without stopping for a bowel movement?" Ohonamuchi answered, saying, "I'll wager on proceeding without stopping for a bowel movement." "Then I will wager on carrying a load of clay," said Sukuna Hikone. Thus, they departed on their journey.

Several days passed, and Ohonamuchi declared that he could proceed no farther. He stopped for a bowel movement. Sukuna Hikone smiled at this, and said, "I am suffering, too." With this he threw his load of clay onto this hill. That is how the hill came to be called Hani-woka (clay hill).

When Ohonamuchi had had his bowel movement, some feces that had dropped on the small bamboo leaves rebounded from the leaves and stained his clothing. Thus, the place was named the hamlet of Hajika (repelling). The clay and feces turned into stones. These stones are said to be still in existence.

According to another version, Haniwoka was named for Prince Homuda's words. While on an inspection tour, Prince Homuda constructed a palace at this hill. He said, "This is the right kind of clay for making mud walls and ceramics." Thus, it was named Haniwoka. The word haniwa (cylindrical clay figurine) is derived from hani, meaning "clay."

Ikuno was named at Prince Homuda's discretion. In the remote past, there was a wild goddess living there who killed half the passersby. That was the reason why the place was called Shinino (dying field). Later, Prince Homuda decided that this name was a bad omen and he changed it to Ikuno (living field).

Ahaka-Kafuchi was named for the Ahaka Gaha, which rises in Ahaka Yama in the district of Asako in Tajima Province. The Ahaka River valley thus was named Ahaka-kafuchi (around the Ahaka). Elm trees grow there.

Ohokafuchi. It was named after the Ohokaha (big river). Therefore, it was named Ohokafuchi (within the big river). Cypress and Richard bald cypress grow there. There are about thirty families there whose customs differ from the local ones.

Yukaha. In the remote past, there was a hot spring in this river. Thus, it was named Yukaha (hot-water river). Cypress, Richard bald cypress, and vines grow there. There are also about thirty families there whose customs differ from the local ones.

Village of Kahanohe. Seka Gaha and Tokaha Yama are in this village. The condition of the soil is slightly below average. This village is located alongside the river. Thus, it was named Kahanohe (beside the river).

Seka was named after a hunting incident involving Prince Homuda. He cornered several wild boar and deer at this place and had his huntsmen shoot and kill the animals. Thus, the area was named Seka (cornering). The prince continued to hunt until night fell and the stars appeared in the sky. Therefore, it is called Hoshikura (numerous stars).

Togaha Yama (sandstone-river hill) was so named because it produces sandstone.

Village of Takawoka. Kamusaki Yama and Nagusa Yama are in this village. The condition of the soil is about average. Takawoka (high hills) was so named because of the high hills in this village.

Kamusaki Yama. The etymology is the same as that for the name of the district.

Nagusa Yama. There is no etymological explanation for the name of this hill. Cypress grows there.

Village of Tada. Ohowachino, Yachigusano, and Nuka Woka are included in this village. The condition of the soil is slightly below average. Tada was named for the words of Prince Homuda. Aganoko, the forebear of the lord-in-waiting Sahekibe, earnestly requested that the prince grant him this land when Prince Homuda came to the area. The prince said, "You requested it so ardently." Thus, it was named Tada (ardently).

Ohowachino was named for the miscanthus used to construct a fence around Ajisuki Takahikone's palace. Ajisuki Takahikone (Prince of the Shining Plough), who resided in the shrine of Nihisuki, built the fence around his palace. That is why it was named Ohowachino (tall miscanthus field).

The place known as Nuka Woka was named after bran piled high at this place. When the Great God of Iwa and the Prince of the Shining Spear fought each other and mobilized their armies, the troops of the great god gathered and pounded rice there. The bran from this rice was piled high. These piles of the winnowed bran were called tsuka (mounds). Some people also called them Kimure Yama (fortress hills), for both ki (fortress) and mure (hills) are words of Korean origin. According to another theory, people from Paekche built fortresses in this area like the ones they knew in their homeland. It was during the reign of Prince Homuda that they came to this area. Yashiro of the Miyake family, in the village of Kahanohe, is one of the descendants of these Paekche people.

Yachigusano was named for the troops of the Prince of the Shining Spear. The place was named Yachigusano (field of eight thousand soldiers).

Village of Kageyama. Kage Woka and Kabuto Woka are in this village. The condition of the soil is slightly below average. Kageyama was named after the headdress of Prince Homuda. Prince Homuda dropped his headdress while walking on the hill in this village. That is why the village is called Kagayama (headdress hill) and the hill Kage Woka. On the same outing, Prince Homuda discovered that his sword was not sharp enough to cut his way through the bushes and tall grass. He issued an order, saying, "Dig some sandstone and bring it to me." That is why the place was named the hamlet of Tohori (sandstone-digging).

Kabuto Woka was named for the helmet of the god Iyo. When the god Iyo was fighting Prince Uchikakumu Toyoho (surrounding strong gates), the god dropped his helmet on this hill. Thus, the hill was named Kabuto Woka (helmet hill).

Village of Ikuhabe. The divine hill of Ihakura and the Takano Shrine are in this village. The condition of the soil is about average. The village was named for the Ikuhabe who lived there.

Divine Hill of Ihakura. The god Uchikakumu Toyoho is consecrated in this hill. Therefore, the hill is called Ihakura (divine rock chair).

The Takano Shrine was so named because of the height of the hill on which it stands. It is the highest hill in the area. Therefore, it is called Takano (high hill). The goddess Tamayori resides on this hill. The Japanese pagoda tree and the katsura tree grow there.

## District of Taka

Taka was named after the words spoken by a man in ancient times. Very long ago there was a giant who always walked bent over. He went from the South Sea to the North Sea, and from there he moved west. When the giant arrived in this land, he said, "I always walked bent over because in other places the sky is low. The sky of this land is high enough so that I can stretch myself and walk upright." This is why the district was named Taka (being high). The giant's footprints became marshes.

Village of Kami. Ohomi Yama and the hamlet of Arata. The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior class. Kami (upper part) was named after the location of the village on the upper part of the river called Sugihara Gaha.

Ohomi Yama was named for the people who lived in this area. In the remote past people from the village of Ohomi in Akashi District came to live at the foot of this hill. Thus, it was named Ohomi Yama. Pine trees grow there.

Arata was named after the condition of the soil of this area. The goddess of this area, who was named Michinushi (road mistress), gave birth to a child deity whose father was unknown. The goddess wished to learn the identity of her child's father and so she planned to have some oracle wine brewed. The goddess cultivated a rice field of about fifteen acres. The rice ripened within seven days. The goddess then prepared sake for oracle use, gathered a great number of gods, and had her son serve the wine. The child god turned immediately, faced the god Ame no Mahitotsu (Prince of the Heavenly Blacksmith), and served him some wine. Thus did the child recognize his father. Afterward, this rice field went unused. That is why the hamlet is called Arata (unused rice field).

Village of Kuroda. Ofu Yama, Kihe Woka, and Ohoamino are in this village. The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior class. Kuroda was named after the color of the soil. It is dark; therefore, this place is called Kuroda (black field).

Ofu Yama was named for the words spoken by the goddess Okitsushima (island in the offing), the Great Goddess of Munakata. In the remote past, the great goddess conceived a child by the great god of Iwa, came to this hill, and said, "My time of waiting is over." Thus, the hill was named Ofu (is over).

Kihe Woka was named for other words of the Great Goddess of Munakata. The goddess said, "The time of my delivery has come." Thus, it was named Kihe (time has come).

Ohoamino was named for a net used to catch birds. In the remote past there was an elderly couple who made a living by catching birds. They strung a huge net and caught birds on Ofu Yama. Once a great number of birds came over, hit the net, and flew away with it. The birds flew as far as this field where they dropped the net. That is why it is called Ohoamino (big net field).

Village of Tsuma. This village includes Tsutaki, Hiya Yama, Hiyano, Suzuhori Yama, Iya Woka, Afu Yama, Takase, Masaki, Wanifutaki, and Atakano. The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior class. Tsuma was named for the tasty water of this area. When they were determining the boundary between their territories, Harima Tome (female chieftain of the land of Harima) and Taniha Tome (female chieftain of the land of Taniha) came to this hill. They ladled some water from a well in this village, tasted it, and said, "This water tastes good." Thus, the place is called Tsuma, an abbreviation of mitsu umashi (water tastes good).

Tsutaki was named for the words spoken by the god Sanuki who courted the female chieftain of this area. In ancient times the god Sanuki came to court Hikami Tome (female chieftain of Hikami in the land of Taniha). Hikami Tome consistently rejected him. But the god insistently kept courting her. This outraged the female chieftain, who asked, "Why do you force me?" She finally hired Prince Take Iha and his troops to get rid of the god Sanuki. The god Sanuki was severely defeated. Upon returning to his home, he said, "How unskillful I am!" Thus, the place was named Tsutaki, an abbreviation of tsutanaki (unskillful).

Hiya Yama was named for the cry of a deer. Once Prince Homuda was hunting on this hill and came upon a deer. The deer cried "hee-hee." Hearing the deer's cry, the prince restrained his huntsmen. Thus, the hill was named Hiya, in imitation of the deer's cry. Likewise, the field was named Hiyano.

Suzuhori Yama was named for a bell lost on this hill. When Prince Homuda visited the area on an official inspection tour, he lost a bell on this hill. Though the prince even had the soil turned over to find the bell, it was never recovered. Thus, the hill was named Suzuhori (bell-digging).

Iya Woka was named for an order of Prince Homuda. One of his hunting dogs, whose name was Manashiro (snow white), chased a wild boar to this hilltop. The prince saw the chase and ordered his men to shoot the boar. That is why the hill was named Iya (arrow-shooting). The dog died of wounds inflicted by the wild boar. The prince buried its body on this hill. Inuhaka (dog grave) is on the west side of this hill.

Afu Yama was named for a pole used to carry wild boar's meat. Thus, it was named Afu (carrying pole).

Takase was named for the shallowness of the river in this area.

Masaki was named for the prince's hound whose eyes were injured by the wild boar. Masaki means "eye-crushing."

Atakano was named for the injured wild boar. While hunting in this field, Prince Homuda heard the groaning of a wild boar that had been shot with an arrow. It therefore was named Atakano (groaning field).

Village of Hafuta. Mika Saka and Hananami Yama are in this village. The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior class. Hafuta was named for an act of the god Sanuki following his struggle with Prince Take Iha. After he lost the battle, the god Sanuki crawled to this area. That is why the place was named Hafuta (crawling field).

Mika Saka was named for Prince Take Iha's cap. When he chased the god Sanuki to this pass, Prince Take Iha said, "You will never be able to cross this border again." So saying, Prince Take Iha placed his cap on this pass. That is why the pass is called Mika Saka, abbreviated from mikage saka (cap pass).

According to another theory, Mika Saka was named for a large jar buried at this place to mark the boundary between the lands of Taniha and Harima. Therefore, it was named Mika Saka (jar pass).

Hananami Yama was named for the god who resides on this hill. This is the god Hananami in Afumi.

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Kamo

Kamo was named for the wild geese that nested in the hamlet of Kamo. It was during the reign of Prince Homuda that a pair of kamo laid eggs there. Thus, the district was named for the birds, Kamo (wild geese).

Village of Kami Kamo. The condition of the soil is slightly above average.

Village of Shimo Kamo. The condition of the soil is about average.

The reason why these two townships are called Kamo was discussed above. Kamo was originally one village. Later it was divided into the two townships of Kami (upper) Kamo and Shimo (lower) Kamo.

While on an inspection tour, Prince Homuda saw a pair of geese land in a tree near the Sufu no Wi (sucking well). The prince asked what kind of birds these were. Sakitama of the Homuchibe no Kimi in Tagima, the lord-in-waiting, replied that these were some of the wild geese that flew along the rivers of the area. The prince ordered the geese shot. One of the prince's huntsmen shot the two birds with an arrow. Although they were both pierced by the arrow, they flew over the ridge of the hill in this village and fell into a dale. Thus, the ridge was named Kamo Saka (geese pass) and the dale into which the birds fell was named Kamo Tani (geese dale). The prince's men prepared the meat of the two birds for his meal. The spot where the meat was cooked was named Nisaka (cooking pass).

There are three dales in the village of Shimo Kamo: Usuwi Tani, Mitani, and Sakaya Tani. The place where the god Ohonamuchi pounded rice was named Usuwi Tani (mortar dale) and the place where he set his winnow was named Mitani (winnow dale). The spot where the god Ohonamuchi built a sake brewery was named Sakaya Tani (brewery dale).

Village of Sufu. The condition of the soil is about average. There is a well in this village. Once a woman was sucked into the well as she attempted to ladle water from it. Thus, the village was named Sufu (sucking).

Kakuhi Yama. Kakuhi was named for a white deer that Prince Homuda saw on this hill. The deer's tongue was protruding when the prince spotted it. That is why the hill was named Kakuhi (deer's tongue showing).

Hamlet of Homuchibe. Homuchibe was so named because Sakitama, the forebear of the Homuchibe family, received a grant of land in this area during the reign of Prince Homuda.

Village of Mihe. The condition of the soil is about average. Long ago a woman of this village obtained a bamboo sprout. She wrapped it in a cloth and nibbled at it. The woman then became numb. She crouched in pain and was unable to stand. Therefore, the place came to be called Mihe (crouching).

Village of Narahara. The condition of the soil is about average. Narahara was named for the oak trees that grow there. Thus, the village came to be known as Narahara (oak field).

Kisumino. Kisumino was named for the words spoken by Kurodawake, the kuni no miyatsuko of this area. During the reign of Prince Homuda, Ohotomo no Muraji petitioned the prince to grant him this land. The prince summoned Kurodawake, the kuni no miyatsuko, for a report on the condition of this place. Kurodawake told him, "It is like a refined garment stored at the bottom of a chest," meaning beautiful, well-conditioned, hidden land. This phrase gave rise to the name Kisumi (hidden treasure).

Ihimori Dake. The hill was so named because Ohonamuchi's rice was piled there.

Nuka Woka. Nuka Woka was named for the chaff that flew on this hill when Ohonamuchi pounded rice in the village of lower Kamo. That is why the place is called Nuka Woka (chaff hill).

There is a hamlet called Tamano in this area. The hamlet was named after the jewels dedicated to the tomb of a beautiful woman who died there. The royal princes Oke and Woke, who resided at the palace in the village of Shijimi in Minagi District, sent Wotate of the Yamabe no Muraji to court Nehime, the daughter of the kuni no miyatsuko Koma of the Kurodawake family. Nehime accepted the marriage proposal. The two princes, however, stood on ceremony, for each was afraid of offending the other by marrying the girl first. In the end, neither of them married her.

Years passed, and the girl grew old and died. The princes were grieved by her death. They sent Wotate with a royal proclamation announcing their wishes regarding the girl's funeral. The royal message read "We shall have her tomb placed where the sun shines from morning till evening. Be sure to bury her remains there, and decorate her tomb with jewels." That is why the hill was named Tama Woka (jewel hill) and the village was called Tamano (jewel field).

Village of Kose. The condition of the soil is the middle grade of the inferior class. Kusaye and Kurokaha belong to this village. Kose was named after the Kosebe who lived in this village. That is why it is called Kose.

Kusaye. Kusaye was named for the smell of the corpses of people executed there. During the reign of Prince Homuda there were several chieftains in the land of Harima who fought among themselves incessantly. Prince Homuda issued an edict prohibiting these contentious and troublesome factions, and then he chased them all to this village where they were executed. The bodies created a terrible stench, and the blood of the dead turned black and flowed like a river. That is why this village is called Kusaye (stinking spot) and the river is called Kurokaha (black river).

Village of Yamada. The condition of the soil is slightly below average. Ikahino is included in this village. Yamada was named for the people who settled alongside the hill of this area. Therefore, the place is called Yamada (hillside field).

Ikahino. Ikahino was named for a wild boar that was kept in this area. During the reign of Prince Takatsu, posthumously known as Emperor Nintoku, who governed the realm from Takatsu Palace in Naniha, Asabe no Kimi, one of the Kumahito of Himuka, a resident of southeastern Kyushu, brought a wild boar to the boat in which the goddess Amaterasu was consecrated. Asabe no Kimi asked the prince for a place in which to keep the wild boar in memory of the goddess Amaterasu. The prince gave this place to the man. The wild boar was released on the hill. Thus, Ikahi (wild-boar keeping) became the designation of this hill.

Village of Hashika. The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior class. Hashika was named for the words spoken by a god. In ancient times there was a god who distributed nuts to the hamlets in this area. But when he came to this hamlet he discovered that he was short of nuts. The god said, "Indeed there are too few nuts." Therefore, it was named Hashika (being short). This deity still resides in this village. Even today, no trees in this village bear nuts. Chinese black pine, cypress, and Richard bald cypress grow there.

Village of Hotsumi. Its former name was Shihono. Womeno belongs to this village. The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior class. Shihono was named after the salty water obtained in this village. Thus, it was named Shihono (salt field). It is now called Hotsumi because the Hotsumi no Omi family lives in this village.

Womeno. Wome was named for words spoken by Prince Homuda while he was on an inspection tour. Prince Homuda stopped in this field, looked all around, in every direction, and said, "What am I seeing there? Is it a sea or a river?" "It is mist, your highness," said the lord-in-waiting. "I cannot see it in detail," said the prince, "although I can get a general idea of what it is." Thus, the place was named Wome (detailed view). The prince also composed a poem there.

Lovely leaves
Of small bamboo of Wome,
Though you suffer
From sleet, or frost,
Do not wither,
You, the leaves of small bamboo of Wome.

Prince Homuda's subjects dug a well at this place. It was named Sasa no Miwi (bamboo-leaves well).

Village of Urumi. The condition of the soil is about average. The original name of Urumi was Umi. It was named for the words of the god Nitsuhiko. The god Nitsuhiko wished to direct the water of Hafuta Gaha toward Urumi, so he made a request to the great water god of this village. The great water god disliked the idea, and said, "I raise rice seedlings by using wild boar's blood. I do not need river water to do that." The god Nitsuhiko reasoned aloud to himself, "This god must be tired of digging the canal. That is why he does not agree with me." Thus, the place was named Umi (being tired). Today people call it Urumi rather than Umi.

Village of Kafuchi. The condition of the soil is slightly below average. The village was named for the river that runs through it. Thus, the village is called Kafuchi (within the river).

Peasants in this village do not spread straw before sowing rice seeds; instead they sow the seeds directly into the wet rice paddy. This custom came from an ancient episode. The Great God of Suminoye, a sea god worshipped by seafarers, came to this village and had his ritual meal there. The god's servants scattered a haystack, which was made by a peasant of this village, to prepare seats for the meal. The owner of the haystack naturally was upset by this, and he appealed to the god Suminoye. The god judged the situation to be serious, and he gave the man a summary decision, saying, "As to the seedlings of your rice field, I will cause them to grow without the hay being spread over the field. They will grow just as though the seedlings were protected by mulch." That is how the farmers of this village came to use hotbeds for rice and no longer spread hay on the ground prior to replanting.

Village of Kahaahi. The condition of the soil is excellent. Harasaki Numa is part of this village. Kahaahi was named for the geographical location of the village, which is situated where the Hashika Gaha flows into the Kamo Gaha. It therefore is called Kahaahi (meeting rivers).

Harasaki Numa. Harasaki was named for a goddess who disemboweled herself and died at this marsh. The goddess from Afumi, the wife of the god Hananami, came upon this place while she was chasing her husband and discovered that her husband had already gone elsewhere. Greatly disappointed, the goddess disemboweled herself and jumped into the marsh. This is why the place is called Harasaki (disemboweling). The silver carp in this marsh are said to have no entrails.

## OBSOLETE DISTRICT
## District of Minagi

Minagi was named for the words spoken by Prince Izahowake, posthumously known as Emperor Richu, while he was on a tour to determine the boundaries of his jurisdiction. When he arrived at the grove of Koso, in the village of Shijimi, he said, "How beautiful are the waters of this land." Thus, the district came to be called Minagi, a derivation of the word minagare uruhashi (beautiful rivers and streams).

Village of Shijimi. The condition of the soil is about average. Shijimi was named for a clam that climbed up to the edge of Prince Izahowake's rice bowl. While Prince Izahowake was having a meal in this village, he noticed a small clam that had climbed to the edge of his rice bowl. The prince said, "This clam is identical to one I ate at Wanasa in Aha." That is how the village came to be called Shijimi (small clam).

Shijimi is the place where the princes Oke and Woke, later known as emperors Ninken and Kenso, spent their youth in exile. Following the murder of their father, Prince Ichinohe, the son of Emperor Richu, at Kutawatano in Afumi, the two princes fled to this village with the assistance of Omi of the Kusakabe no Muraji. There they found shelter in a stone cave.

After securing this shelter for the princes, Omi unbridled their horses, burned all their belongings to erase the evidence of their presence, and strangled himself. He strangled himself because he was aware that by protecting contenders to the throne he had committed a grave offense against the new ruler.

The two princes kept changing their shelters from one place to another, finally seeking refuge with Itomi, the village chief of Shijimi. This they did by disguising themselves as servants. Itomi was a rich man, and he built a new dwelling while the princes were serving him. At the dedication of his new house, Itomi let the two princes keep the light burning in the courtyard.

Later that night, Itomi asked them to sing congratulatory songs for him. The princes told each other, "After you," but finally the younger stood up and sang. Among the songs he sang was the following:

With iron hoe
Of Kibi,
The sufficient,
Till you the land.
Why not clap your hands;
I will dance.

Also:

The land of water is Afumi,
The green fenced is Yamato;
He who governed the realm
In green fenced Yamato
Was Ichinohe; but his descendants,
Alas, are servants!

At this, everybody rushed to pay their respects to the princes. Among them was Wotate, of the Yamabe no Muraji, who later was made supervisor of Yamato in the land of Harima, a territory under the direct rule of the royal house. Wotate said, "They are indeed the sons of Princess Tashiraga. I have heard that her grief at losing her sons is such that she can neither eat nor sleep. She is dying of grief."

Thus, Wotate journeyed to the Court to see Princess Tashiraga and reported to her what he had witnessed. By that time Prince Ohohatsuse, who had murdered the princes' father, had died. Princess Tashiraga's joy was such that she shed tears at the good news. She immediately sent Wotate to fetch her sons. The princess and her sons rejoiced upon seeing each other and they spoke together of their long and painful separation.

Afterward the princes returned to the village of Shijimi and constructed their palaces there. Thus, the palaces of Takano, Wono, Kahamura, and Ikeno were built. Royal granaries were also constructed. The hamlet in which the granaries were built was named Miyake, and the place where the granaries stood was named Mikurawo (royal granary site).

The deities who reside in the shrine of Hafuta of the village of Takano are Tamatarashihiko Ohoinawo and Tamatarashihime Toyoiname. The god who resides in the shrine of Misaka in the village of Shijimi is Ashihara no Shikowo (Ugly Man in the Reed Field) whose other name is Yatokakasu Mimoro. When he consolidated this land, the Ugly Man in the Reed Field ascended to the top of Misaka no Mine and became the guardian god of products.

The name of the village of Yegaha was so designated because the goddess Yegaha no Ohotoji (female chief) resides there.

The name of the village of Hirano (flat field, or opened field) was so decided because of the configuration of the land there.

The name of the village of Takano (highland) was so decided because of the configuration of the land there.
