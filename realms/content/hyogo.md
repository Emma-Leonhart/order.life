The Realm of Hyōgo is a realm in Japan.

Old provinces: Harima, Tajima, Awaji, Tanba, Settsu.


The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
[DISTRICT OF KAKO]
Looking all around [him, the prince] said, “This land is shaped like a
[huge] kako with [rolling] hills and stretching fields.! Thus, this district
came to be called Kako. When the prince went out hunting, a deer
ran up this hill and cried out “hee-hee.” Therefore, the hill was named
Hiwoka.’ {The residing deity there is Ihatsuhiko (Prince of Rock),
the son of Ohomitsuha.} Hire Haka is located on this hill. It is called
Hire Haka because [of the following story].
' The subject of the first sentence is missing in the original. Michiyasu Inoue
suggests that Homuda (Emperor Oujin) is the subject, while Hisamatsu favors
Ohotarashi (Emperor Keiko). Akimoto is undecided. Inoue’s contention is based
on the name of the residing deity of Hiwoka, recorded in the Engi-shiki jinmyocho,
which is given as Isasahiko. He argues that Isasahiko is a rendering of Homuda’s
other name, Isasawake. My interpretation follows Hisamatsu. In any case, most
scholars insist that the original document compiled in Harima Province must have
begun with a description of the district of Akashi. This portion is now missing.
Akashi District belonged to Harima Province at the time of the compilation of the
document, and was situated on the eastern border of the province. Also missing
from the extant text is the heading for the district of Kako; this translation supplies
it in brackets.
? The word kako is traditionally interpreted to mean “deer,” because of the
text’s etymological explanation, but there is no topographical resemblance to a
deer. A more liberal translation of this passage would be: [While Prince Ohotarashi
was out hunting,] a deer nimbly climbed a hill and let out a cry. The cry sounded
something like “hee-hee.” The hill is therefore called Hiwoka (the hill of “hee”).
Looking all around [him, the prince] said, “Vast are the hills and fields of this land.
As I look down at the hill on which I stand, it reminds me of a kako (deer).” That
is how the district came to be called Kako.

The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 165
Once upon a time Prince Ohotarashi decided to court Wake Iratsume
(Princess Wake) of Inami. On the courting journey he wore a long
sword decorated with carved jewels and a bright mirror. He took Okinaga
{also called Ishiji} [along to serve] as his escort. This man is the
forebear of the Yama no Atahi family in Kamo District of this province.’
Prince Ohotarashi and his escort arrived at the ford of the Takase
in Settsu. At the prince’s request for a ferry, the boatman, a resident
of Kii named Wotama, said, “I am not your subject, sir.” The prince
replied, “Nevertheless, let me cross the river, agi (my dear man).” The
man answered, “If you wish to cross here, you must pay the fare.”
Thereupon the prince threw the boatman his kadzura (travelling cap).
It lay in the boat [with its jewels] glistening [in the sun]. Upon receiving this [unusual] fare, the boatman ferried the prince across the
tiver. Thus, the place came to be called Agi no Watari (Agi ford)
[after the prince’s manner of addressing the boatman].
> Wake Iratsume: Similar names appear in both the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki
(NKBT 1, 202-3; Aston, Nihongi, 1:191, 2n). The family name Yama no Atahi
appears in a document of the Nara period. The postscript of a copied sutra produced in 734 mentions three members of the Yama no Atahi family of the district
of Kamo in Harima Province. Therefore, the Yama no Atahi family must have
been influential in this area. See Fudoki, ed. Hisamatsu Sen’ichi (Tokyo: Asahi
Shinbun Sha, 1950), 1:105-6.
4 We can infer from this story that the influence of the man called Prince
Ohotarashi had not yet reached Settsu. Nonetheless, in this section of the document he is referred to as sumera mikoto. A question thus arises: is it always proper
to translate this term as “emperor”? In my opinion, the term came to mean “emperor”
only during Empress Suiko’s time (the early seventh century, or even later, when
the Kojiki was compiled). Settsu: Settsu no Kuni in Japanese. It would be improper
to translate this phrase as “Settsu Province,” for province applies only to an area
under the control of the central government. For the period covered by the Harima
fudoki, a clear distinction must be made. Settsu after the Taika Reform (645) may
properly be called Settsu Province, while the Settsu of the pre-Taika period should
be referred to as Old Settsu, or simply Settsu. This principle is also applied to other
areas, including Izumo, Kibi, and Kahachi. Travelling cap: The original (extant)
document contains graphs that can be rendered as “beautiful vine prepared for the
journey.” The second and third graphs read as michtyuki in Japanese. Note that the
word appears here for the first time in known history. It became an important
literary device in seventeenth-century plays in which the michiyuki (lovers’ journey) is crucial in deciding the course of events. See Donald Keene, Major Plays of

The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 167
The prince arrived at Kashihade no Miwi in the district of Akashi
where he took his princely meal. Thus, the place was named Kashihade
no Miwi (the well of Kashihade).
Meanwhile in Kako, Princess Wake learned of the prince’s journey
to seek her hand in marriage and she fled in fear to an island. The
prince arrived on the shore of Kako no Matsuhara (pine groves of Kako)
only to find the princess gone and a white dog barking in the direction
of the sea. The prince inquired [about the dog, saying,] “Whose dog
is this?” Suzumura no Obito (local chieftain of Suzumura) answered,
“It is Princess Wake’s dog.” The prince said, “Your information is of
great help to me.” Thus, the man was renamed Tsuge no Obito (chief
informant).°
Having learned of the princess’s whereabouts, the prince wished
to cross the straits to the island. He went to Ahetsu (Ahe harbor)
where he ate his ahe (meal). Thereafter, the place came to be called
the village of Ahe. Fish caught in the straits were served to the prince
on a mitsuki tray. This is why the place is called Mitsuki. The prince
ordered a wharf to be built of young tree branches from which he
embarked for the island. Thus, the place came to be called Tanatsu
(wharf).°
Upon reaching the island and seeing the princess for the first time,
the prince’s first words to her were, “Nabihashi tsuma.of the isle” (My
beloved wife who has been hiding on this island). The island then
became known as Nabitsuma (hiding wife). The prince tied his boat
to hers and gave his pilot [escort] Okinaga a new name, Ohonaka no
Chikamatsu (New York: Columbia University Press, 1961). The last two graphs
read as otokatsura or otokadzura. Otokatsura was an ornamental headdress worn
by a person having the right to perform rituals for the gods, namely, a chieftain or
shaman.
> White dog: Things white were regarded in general by the early Japanese as
bringing good fortune. For instance, a pair of white birds was an important tributary
item presented to the reigning emperor by the kuni no miyatsuko (high priest) of
Izumo Province in the eighth century (Aoki, Izumo fudoki, 19).
6 This place is identified by the locals as the present-day Ahe-mura in Kakogun. Small tray: Mitsuki in the original. Mi is an honorific. Tsuki is a small serving
tray with a single stem at the center.
168 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
Ishiji (Ishiji the grand intermediary). [The escort guided their boats
back to the mainland.]’
Upon returning to the mainland the couple journeyed to the village
of Mutsugi in the district of Inami in order to conduct their mutsubigoto (lovers’ talk) for the first time. The place therefore came to be
called by the name of Mutsugi (a derivation of mutsubigoto). The prince
[was not pleased with this place. He] complained, “The sound of
waves and cries of birds here are annoying.” Thus, he [and his wife]
moved to a palace built on higher ground, the site of which later
came to be called Takamiya (palace on the high [ground]).
Several buildings were added to the palace grounds. The site of
the sake brewery became the village of Sakaya (sake brewery). The
site of the pantry and/or kitchen became the village of Niheta, and
the basement storehouse (muro) became the village of Murotsumi.®
For his wedding ceremony, the prince moved to a newly constructed
[fortified] palace. After the ceremony, he presented his escort, Okinaga
[Ohonaka no Ishiji], with one of the palace’s ladies-in-waiting. This
was Hisura, a daughter of the Izumo no Omi. This man’s grave is
located west of the posting-station of Kako.’
Years passed and Princess Wake died at the [fortified] palace. For
her grave [the prince] chose a site on Hiwoka. As the funeral procession
was crossing Inami Gaha (Inami river), a cyclone rose from downstream, causing the waves to suck the body of the deceased into the
river. Her body was never recovered; only her comb box and scarf
were found. The funeral was conducted with the burial of these two
objects. That is why the place is called Hire Haka (scarf tomb).
Grief stricken, the prince swore never to eat another fish from this
river. As a result, ayu caught in Inami Gaha may not be used as tribute
presented to the court."
In later years the prince himself became ill. [Medicine was sent for,
’ Nabihashi tsuma: The word nabi means “to hide/hiding,” hashi means “lovely,”
and tsuma means “sweetheart.”
8 Storehouse: My reading of this word follows Akimoto. Hisamatsu reads it as
yakata, which means “a lodge.”
” Fortified palace: Kimiya in the original. Ki (in kimiya) means “Korean-style
fortress.” The site of the fortress is unknown but it was most likely on the hillside.
'° Ayu: A fish belonging to the Plecoglossid family. It previously had been an
important item of tribute presented-by Harima Province to the Imperial Court.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 169
and] a new palace was constructed at his request in Kako no Matsuhara. The prince moved into the new palace. [There] a man found a
good [vein of] water and dug a well. Because of this, the area came to
be known as Matsuhara no Miwi (august well in the pine grove).!!
Village of Magari. {The condition of the soil in this village is slightly
above average.} When Prince Ohotarashi made an inspection tour of
this area, he noticed the river winding through this village, and he
said, “The curve of this river is very beautiful.” That is why the place
is called Magari (curve).!?
Village of Ahaha. {The condition of the soil in this village is about
average.} In ancient times, Korime, the forebear of the Ohotomo no
Miyatsuko, tilled this land and sowed a great deal of millet. The
place is therefore called Ahaha (abundant millet).!’
'' Tn early Japanese belief, a place where a person became ill was considered to
be contaminated. When stricken by illness, people moved from one place to another
to ward off such contamination. When a sovereign died, the capital was moved to
a new site, a custom that strongly suggests a northeastern Eurasian origin.
2. The imperial edict of 713 asked provincial governors to supply the central government with information about land conditions. The condition of the soil was roughly
classified into three groups: superior, average, and inferior. Each group was divided
into subgroups—better, medium, and poor—making a total of nine categories.
Superior better superior in every way
Superior medium excellent
Superior poor very good
Average better slightly above average
Average medium about average
Average poor slightly below average
Inferior better upper grade of the inferior class
Inferior medium middle grade of the inferior class
Inferior poor lowest grade of the inferior class
The etymology for the village of Magari given here seems unsubstantiated by the
local topography. It is more plausible that the village was once owned by Prince Magari,
hence the name (see “Village of Koshibe,” under the “District of Ihibo” below).
'3 Ahaha: This village is not included in the Wamyosho. Akimoto assumes that
its site is the present-day Kakogawa City (NKBT 2, 263, l6n). Korime: She was
known as a Korean immigrant from Kara. The story perhaps represents slash-andburn agriculture, the main products of which were millet and kaoliang, crops
cultivated in Japan before the introduction of wet rice.
170 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
There is a field in this village called Funahiki. It is said that in the
past there was a tempestuous god in the nearby village of Kamusaki
who detained half the boats that passed there. Therefore, boatmen
passing through the area tried to avoid the god by entering Ohotsu no
E (Ohotsu inlet) in Inami and rowing upstream on the Inami Gaha
(Inami river). At the dale of Kaworita the boatmen would pull their
vessels over the land, dragging them as far as Hayashi no Minato
(waterway of Hayashi) in the district of Akashi. This is why the field
is called Funahiki (boat-pulling).!*
The etymology [for the name Hayashi no Minato] is the same as
that provided in the report [from the district of Akashi] above.”
Village of Nagata.{The condition of the soil is about average.} Once
upon a time, there was a long rice-field located along the road that
Prince Ohotarashi was accustomed to take to visit Princess Wake.
While passing [the field] one day, the prince was heard to say, “What
a long rice-field this is!” Therefore, the place came to be called the
village of Nagata (long rice-fields) .'®
Village of Umaya. {The condition of the soil is about average.} This
village belongs to the umaya. Because of this function, it is called
Umaya no Sato (village of the posting-station).!”
[DISTRICT OF INAMI]
According to a tradition, the district of Inami was named after the
calm waves of the sea during the time of [Prince Tarashi Naka, posthumously known as Emperor Chuai] who governed the realm from
Toyora Palace in Anato. The prince was to go down to Kumaso State,
in Tsukushi, accompanied by his wife. En route to Tsukushi their boat
was anchored at the shore of Inami. At that time the sea was very
‘4 This story suggests the existence not only of frequent high tides but of pirates.
'’ This statement appears to refer to the missing Akashi section (see note 1).
The word ge (“report”) in the original authenticates the document’s compilation
date, namely, the eighth century.
'6 The site of Nagata is the present-day Onoe-cho, in Kakogawa.
'’ Umaya no Sato: The posting-station of Kako. The income from this village
was used for the upkeep of the posting-station (see Aoki, Izumo fudoki, 28).
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 171
calm, the wind and waves quiet. Therefore, it was named Irinami
(quiet waves). Inami is the derivation of Irinami.'®
Village of Ohokuni. {The condition of the soil is about average.}
Ohokuni was named after the peasants’ dwellings located there. They
were so numerous that the place came to be called Ohokuni (thickly
populated/large territory).
In this village there is a hill called Iho Yama. When Prince Tarashi
Naka passed away, his wife, Princess Okinaga Tarashi, took Ohoku of
the Ishitsukuri no Muraji (chief stonecutter) as her guide and travelled to Sanuki in search of hawaka stones [for the prince’s burial
chamber].'? The site of the funerary shed had not yet been chosen
when Ohoku found the right kind of stones. Returning [from Sanuki,]
Ohoku discovered this hill [and found it suitable for the burial site].
That is why the site is called Iho Yama (sepulchral mound).”°
There is a field on the west side of this hill. In the field is a pond.
Thus, the field is called Ike no Hara (pond field). In the southern part of
this field there is a piece of sculpture in the shape of a house. It is about
twenty feet long, fifteen feet wide, and fifteen feet high. The sculpture is called Ohoishi (great stone). It is said that the stone was carved
by the order of the Yuge no Ohomuraji during Prince Shotoku’s reign.?!
'8 Prince Tarashi Naka: Posthumously known as Emperor Chuai. Most postwar
Japanese historians deny that Emperor Chuai existed. According to the widely
accepted current view, he and his wife, Okinaga Tarashi (Empress Jingu), were
created by the editors of the Kojiki and the Nihon shoki to legitimize Emperor
Oujin’s claim to the throne. The phrase, which is translated here as “according to
a tradition,” literally means “one authority says.” It is commonly used in the Harima
fudoki to introduce variant etymological explanations. For more information about
postwar scholarship, see Inoue Mitsusada, “Nihon kodaishi to Tsuda Sokichi.” In
ed. Ueda Masaaki. Hito to shiso: Tsuda Sokichi. Kyoto: San’itsu Shobo, 1974, 255-70.
'9 Princess Okinaga Tarashi: A quasi-mythological figure of the Japanese imperial
genealogy known as Empress Jingu (see Aoki, “Empress Jingu,” 3-39).
20 Scholars differ in their interpretations of the use of the site. In Akimoto’s
opinion, it was used as a temporary burial site (NKBT 2, 265, 18n, 19n). See also
Inoue Michiyasu, Harima fudoki shinko (Tokyo: Ookayama Shoten, 1931), 68;
and Fudoki (Hisamatsu), 1:112.
“1 Yuge no Ohomuraji is another name for Mononobe Moriya (?—587), an influential person at Court who was opposed to Prince Shotoku’s policy of adopting
Buddhism as a Court-sponsored religion.
172 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
Village of Mutsugi.{The condition of the soil is about average.} The
reason the place is called Mutsugi is discussed above. In this village
there is a pine grove where mushrooms grow abundantly. Their color
is like that of the flower of the namomi plant, and their shape is like
that of uguhisutake mushrooms.They sprout early in the tenth month
and last about twenty days. The taste of these mushrooms is excellent.”
Village of Yake. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average. }
Yake is named after Prince Ohotarashi’s granaries, which were built
in this village. That is why it is called the village of Yake (royal granary).”
In this village are two [monuments] called Masukata Yama. Both
are made of rocks. One monument resembles a square measuring cup,
and the other is like a barrel. Situated near them is a stone bridge. It
is said that once this bridge reached the sky (heaven) and people
climbed up and down between heaven and earth. That is why it is
called Yaso Hashi (bridge crossed by the multitudes).
Village of Kamuki. {The former name was Kame-ochi.} The condition of the soil is slightly above average.” Kame-ochi was named after
an incident that occurred during the reign of Prince Takatsu [posthumously known as Emperor Nintoku] who governed the realm from
Takatsu Palace in Naniha. Kumachi from Wosada, the forebear of the
Kisakibe archers, travelled this area looking for a suitable place to build
his house. He tied a wine jar to the flank of the horse he was riding.
*? Namomi and uguhisutake: Because the graphs were badly distorted during the
copying process, it is difficult to identify the names of these plants. These readings
are tentative.
This site is the present-day Masuda, Higashi Kamiyoshi, Kakogawa.
4 This passage has long been taken as proof that the ancient Japanese believed
in the existence of heaven and earth. See “Shaku Nihongi,” in Shintei zoho kokushi
taikei, ed. Kuroita Katsumi (Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kobunkan, 1932), 8:75. In reality,
however, the bridge in question could have been a symbol for either the political or
the psychological boundary between the old residents and the new.
’ When the old name of a place was reported, it was inscribed in small graphs.
Thus, in this translation the old name has been placed in braces.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 173
While he was in this village, the wine jar fell off and landed [on the
ground]. Thus, the village was named Kame-ochi (jar-dropping).®
There is also a place called Saka Yama in this village. During the
time of Prince Ohotarashi a spring of wine issued forth at this place.
This is why it was named Saka Yama (wine hill). Whenever the farmers
became intoxicated with this wine, they fought each other wildly.
Hence, the prince ordered that the spring be plugged. Later, in the
year of Kanoye Uma (670) someone reopened the spring. The water of
this spring still retains the flavor of sake wine.
There is a small island called Nabitsuma in the sea off the southern
coast of this district. Prince Taka Anaho [posthumously known as
Emperor Seimu], who governed the realm from the palace of Taka
Anaho in Shiga, sent Hikonamuchi, the ancestor of the Wanibe no
Omi, to determine the provincial boundaries. At that time Kibihiko
and Kibihime (the chieftains of this area) came to see the royal [surveyor] Hikonamuchi. Hikonamuchi wed Kibihime, and she gave birth
to a girl. This girl was Wake Iratsume of Inami [the Princess Wake
who later married Prince Ohotarashi]. Her beauty was unsurpassed.
Prince Ohotarashi wished to marry this maiden and went to court
her. Learning of his [impending] visit, the princess fled to this island
and hid herself there. That is why the island is called Nabitsuma
(hiding wife).”’
District of Shikama
The district of Shikama was named after the words of Prince Ohomima.
[Once,] when he was staying at his temporary palace in this district,
6 Prince Takatsu (r. c. 420): His palace is described as Naniha no Takatsu no
Ohomiya in the original. Kisakibe archers: Kisakibe no Yumitori in Japanese.
Kisakibe were the people who worked for the wives of reigning princes. The
practice of creating Kisakibe was a device used to strengthen the royal family in
early Japan. Yumitori could also be read as a personal name meaning “those who
take up the bow.”
21 Hikonamuchi: The Kasuga no Omi and Kakimoto no Omi families are also
said to have been the descendants of Hikonamuchi. Wanibe: The Wanibe family
was powerful in the Yamato region (Fudoki [Hisamatsu], 1:113, 28n).
174 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
he heard the loud cry of a deer. The prince exclaimed, “Oh, the deer
cries so!” Because of this, it is called the district of Shikama (deercrying land).’®
Village of Ayabe. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average. }
Ayabe was named after immigrants who came from the land of Sanuki
[on Shikoku Island] to live there. That is why the place is called Ayabe
(immigrant group).”
Village of Sugafu. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average. }
Sugafu was named after the sedge fields surrounding this area. That
is why it is called Sugafu (sedge-growing).
Village of Masaki. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average. }
Masaki was named after the words of Prince Homuda [posthumously
known as Emperor Oujin].°° When the prince came upon this area,
while on an inspection tour, he said, “These two hills remind me of a
man’s tattooed eyes.” That is why it is called Masaki (tattooed eyes) .*!
Village of Aga. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average.}
8 Prince Ohomima: The original reads Oho Mimatsuhiko, which could be
rendered as Prince Mima the Great. In the next line of the original he is described
by means of the Chinese graph wang (ohokimi in Japanese), which is usually rendered as “prince” by Sinologists. However, in Japanese scholarship the same graph
is customarily interpreted as “king.” Probably the man was a chieftain who came
from a place called Mima, possibly on the Korean Peninsula.
”? Traditionally, Japanese scholars have interpreted the words ayabe and ayahito
to mean “those who came from Paekche.” However, not all the immigrants necessarily came from that area. Some may have come from places such as Silla, Koguryo,
mainland China, and even Southeast Asia.
* Although Prince Homuda, traditionally identified as Emperor Oujin (r. c.
390-410), is known to have engaged in a military campaign on the Korean Peninsula, recent scholarship casts doubt upon this identification (see Ledyard, “Galloping,” 217-54).
*! Tattooed eyes: This refers to a type of permanent eyeshadow, which is applied to the outer edges of the eyes in a particular design so as to make them look
larger. A comparable custom is observed by a small number of Ainu who live in
Hokkaido today.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki LD
The village is named after the two deities who reside there. They are
Agahiko and Agahime, the son and daughter of the Great God of
Iwa. Because of this the place is called Aga.
Village of Iwa [Iwa-be]. [This village includes the areas of] Funawoka,
Namiwoka, Kotowoka, Hakowoka, Kushigewoka, Miwoka, Mikawoka,
Inawoka, Kabutowoka, Ikariwoka, Fujiwoka, Shikawoka, Inuwoka,
and Himejiwoka.*? The condition of the soil of this village is slightly
above average. Iwa-be was named after the people who migrated there.
Iwa no Kimi and his family came from the district of Shisaha to settle
in this area. That is why it came to be known as Iwabe.*4
[There is a hill called Tegariwoka in this village.] Tegariwoka was
named after the deed of a neighborhood deity who came to this area
to cut grass by hand, and who wove a mat on which to sit while
eating. That is why it is called Tegariwoka (hand-cut hill). According
to another version, Korean immigrants in this area did not know how
to use the sickle, so they simply cut grass by hand. Their method of
cutting grass gave the village the name Tegari (cutting by hand).*
[Apart from Tegariwoka,] the aforesaid fourteen hills are described
in detail, as follows. Long ago, Hoakari, the son of Ohonamuchi, was
known for his fierce and reckless nature. Ohonamuchi was very upset
by his son’s temperament, and he decided [to disown him]. He devised
[a scheme] to get rid of him. He took his son to Kamiyama (godly
hill) in [the village of] Idate and ordered him to fetch some water.
32 The Great God of Iwa is known to have been a god of the land of Izumo. He
may be the representation of a powerful chieftain who came from Izumo to the
land of Harima.
33 The texts differ in the order in which they list these hills. This translation
follows Akimoto who rearranged the order according to the appearance of the hills
in the following sentences.
44 Twa no Kimi family: This family lived in the district of Shisaha and worshiped
the Great God of Iwa as their ancestral deity. They seem to have been descended
from the people who came to the area from northern Harima.
35 The original text states that they broke off the grass by hand. Probably they
were using harvesting knives, which have no handle. Korean immigrants are here
described as Karahito. The graph denoting kara stands for han in Korean.
176 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
[The area was adjacent to the sea in those days.] Before Hoakari
could return, Ohonamuchi embarked [upon the water] to escape.”
When Hoakari returned with the water, he spied his father’s boat
sailing away. Outraged, he caused winds and high waves to rise, and
chased his father’s boat. Ohonamuchi’s boat was unable to navigate
under such conditions and was wrecked. The area [where the ship
was wrecked] thus came to be known as Funawoka (boat hill) and
Namiwoka (wavy hill). [When his boat broke up, Ohonamuchi’s belongings were thrown into the sea and transformed into several hills.]
Thus, Kotokamiwoka (zither-god hill) appeared at the site where
Ohonamuchi’s zither fell. Hakowoka (box hill) appeared at the site
where his box fell, and Kushigewoka (comb hill) where his comb
dropped. At the site to which the winnow was thrown, Mikatawoka
(winnower hill) emerged. [Likewise,] the place where Ohonamuchi’s
wine jar fell produced Mikawoka (jar hill). The place where his rice
sank into the water yielded Inamurewoka (rice, or rice-stalk, hill).
[Ohonamuchi’s weapons also sank and were transformed into hills. ]
These are Kabutowoka (helmet hill), Ikariwoka (anchor hill), and
Fujiwoka (wisteria-rope hill). [Ohonamuchi’s animals were also transformed into hills.] Thus emerged Shikawoka (deer hill), Inuwoka
(dog hill), and Himejiwoka (silkworm hill).*’
Ohonamuchi later spoke of his misfortune to his wife Princess
Notsu, saying, “I intended to escape from that reckless child [but the
consequences were worse than I expected.] I suffered much from
rough winds and waves.” This is why the area is called Ikashiho (angry waves), or Tashiname no Watari (ford of suffering) .*®
36 Prince Hoakari is described as the son of Ninigi in the NS. He is said to have
been the forebear of the Ohari no Muraji family (Nihongi, trans. Aston, part 1, p.85;
Saeki, Shinsen hojiroku, 222). Ohonamuchi is considered to be the tutelary deity of
the Izumo people. He has about a dozen alternate names. In the folklore tradition
of later times this deity is better known by the name of Ohokuninushi. Both
Ohonamuchi and Ohokuninushi mean “great land holder.” See Aoki, Izumo fudoki,

Village of Kaya (mosquito netting). {Mitegurawoka is in this village. }
The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Kaya was named
after the mosquito net [that protected Prince Homuda from bites
while he was travelling in this area]. The prince had his hut built at
this place and put up a mosquito net in the building. That is why the
place is called Kaya (mosquito netting). The same word is the etymology for the hill and the river in this village.
Mitegurawoka. It was named after a deed of Prince Homuda. The
prince went [to the top of this hill] to present gifts to the local deities.
The hill therefore was named Mitegurawoka (gift-offering hill).*”
Village of Karamuro. {The condition of the soil is about average. }
Karamuro is named after Korean-style storage buildings. The forebear
of Takara of the Karamuro no Obito family was very wealthy and
successful. He erected Korean-style buildings around the area. That
is how the place came to be known by the name of Karamuro (Koreanstyle houses) .*°
Village of Kochi. {The hamlets of Kusakami and Ohotachiwoka [belong
to this village].} The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the
inferior class. The Kochi, an immigrant family that settled in this
village, was the first [to clear the farmland]. Thus, the family name of
Kochi came to designate this village.*!
The name of Kusakami [hamlet] also has some relation to an immigrant family. Kana, of the Nara no Kochi, who is the forebear of
Yamamura, originally from Korea, requested this land for reclamation.
At that time there was grass growing there, the roots of which had a
distinct odor. That is why the hamlet came to be known by the name
Kusakami (stinking grass).
» The story may represent political concessions among local leaders of this area.
40 The Karamuro no Obito family was probably of Korean origin. Muro literally
means “room or storage place.” I have translated it as “buildings and houses.”
+! A textile fragment preserved in the Imperial Repository of Shosoin bears the
graphs that mean “the owner of the rice field at Kochi” (cited in Takeuchi, Nihon
kodai jimmeijiten, 775).
# The word Nara, a part of this man’s name, indicates that the family first
settled in the Nara region and then moved to this area. Hence, the Narano Kochi
family is distinct from the above-mentioned Kochi family. Kochi is a place name in

Ohotachiwoka was named after an act of Prince Homuda. One
day the prince went to the top of this hill to observe the land. That is
why the hill is called Ohotachi (grandstand).
Village of Asako. {Nagaunegaha [runs through this village].} The
condition of the soil is about average. Asako was named after the
birthplace of the farmers who settled in this area. [The story goes
back to the time of Prince Homuda’s reign.] Prince Homuda came to
this place from the land of Tajima. On his way he was unable to obtain [materials for] his head ornament, mikage. This gave one hill of
the area the name Kageyama no Saki (hill [without] headdress). Toyo
Oshiwake, the kuni no miyatsuko, was stripped of his title and office.”
Presently Akone, the kuni no miyatsuko of Tajima[, came to his
rescue]. Akone interceded with [the prince] for [Toyo Oshiwake, in
an attempt] to have the latter’s offense pardoned. According to the
agreement then concluded, Toyo Oshiwake surrendered about ten
acres of rice field, labelled salt land, to compensate for his offense,
and he regained his title and office.
[The prince arranged] for his farmers from Asako, in the land of
Tajima, to settle this newly acquired rice land. That is how the village
came to be known as Asako.*{It was formerly called Asakobe. The
word asako was expressed by one graph. Later, according to the order
of [the Council of State], the word asako came to be expressed by two
graphs. }

Yamamura of Korean descent: According to the NS, the ancestors of the Yamamura
came to the Yamato region from Paekche in 540 (Nihongi, part 2, 38).
*} Head ornament: This passage in the original is corrupt, and the graph in most
texts is meaningless. According to Inoue Michiyasu, however, a kind of headdress
is intended. I have followed Inoue’s interpretation on the assumption that providing
headdress materials to a new ruler might have been a symbolic gesture of submission
(Inoue Michiyasu, Harima fudoki shinko, 407).
** This must have been a device through which the early rulers gained control
over the land of other chieftains. In early Japanese belief, salt was thought to
counteract an offense. Thus, the ceded land was labelled salt land.
* “Newly acquired rice land” is my liberal translation of the original text. The
original reads shihoshiro no ta, which literally means “the rice field for [the expense]
of salt.”
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 179
According to the [source material] for this report, Akone [the
friend of Toyo Oshiwake] married a woman from the village of Aho.
He lived with her in this village until [the time of] his death. When
he died his people constructed a tomb and buried him in the village.
It is said that later his kabane (remains, or bones) were moved to [his
place of origin].*°
Nagaunegaha was named after the village of Nagaune in Kamo
District from which people would go to harvest makomo (wild rice).
A struggle ensued between these people and [the followers of]
Ishitsukuri no Muraji [who had settled there. Earlier settlers tried to
prevent the people of Nagaune from stealing. The former] killed [the
latter] and threw their bodies into the river. The river was named
after the village of the slain people, Nagaune.
Village of Hirano. {The hamlet of Shirakuni and the hill called
Hakowoka [belong to this village].} The place now called Hirano
(reclaimed land) was once called Wono (small field). The hamlet of
Shirakuni was named after [a group of] people who came from Shiragi
(Silla) in the past. When the people [envoys] of the Silla Court came
to the [Japanese] Court [to present tribute,] they usually took lodging
in this village. That is why it is called Shirakuni (place of Sillans).
{There is also a hill of the same name. }
Hakowoka was named after the utensils of Princess Himejiwoka
who allowed Ohonamuchi Sukuna Hikone to pay a nightly visit to
her. The princess kept food and such utensils as a food box on this
hill. Therefore, the place came to be called Hakowoka (box hill).*
Village of Ohono. {Tohori is located in this village.} The condition of
the soil is about average. The place now called Ohono was once a
46 Akone: By interceding in the conflict between Toyo Oshiwake and the
prince, this man seems to have obtained the position of the prince’s deputy at
Asako village. The original places this paragraph about Akone after the etymology
of Nagaunegaha. Akone’s bones must have been moved to his place of birth, as
such a practice was customary.
47 Ohonamuchi Sukuna Hikone: Most commentators agree that this is the
combined name of two deities, Ohonamuchi and Sukuna Hikone. Note that
Ohonamuchi means “great land holder” while Sukuna Hikone means “small land
holder.”
180 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
vast barren field, and thus it gave rise to the name Ohono (vast field).
During the reign of Prince Shima, who governed the realm from Shima
Palace [posthumously known as Emperor Kimmei], Weta, the forebear
of Murakami Tarushima, requested this area [reclaimed it] and stayed
there. The village is still called Ohono.*
Tohori was named after a site from which sandstone was dug. During
the reign of Prince Homuda a road was built along the Ohokaha (great
river), the boundary between the districts of Kamusaki and Shikama.
At that time sandstone was dug from the site. Therefore, the place
came to be called Tohori (sandstone-digging). The place still produces
sandstone.
Village of Wogaha. {[This village includes] the hamlets of Takase and
Toyokuni, Agamano, Imesaki, Mayumisaka, Mitachiwoka, and
Itoshima.} The condition of the soil is about average. {The former
name of this village was Kisaki no Sato.} Kisaki was named after the
occupation of aman who belonged to the Kisaki-be (empress’s corporate
group). This man was Yumitsuka. His forebear was Hiru of the Tatari
no Kimi. This Hiru of the Tatari no Kimi asked Prince Shima to grant
him this land. His descendants were later made the Kisaki-be. That
is why the village was called Kisaki in the past. In the year of Kanoye
Tora [690], Councillor Kamitsu Keno renamed it Wogaha (small river).
Councillor Kamitsu Keno was governor of Harima Province at that
time.*?
According to another version, Wogaha was named after a small
stream that flows from the field of Ohono to this area.
The hamlet of Takase was named after rapids in this area. When
Prince Homuda was viewing the area from the top of Imesaki, he
looked to the north and saw a white object moving in the distance.
‘8 Prince Shima: The original text describes this prince’s office as Shima no
Miya. It is generally agreed that this is the same as the Shiki-Shima no Miya
described in the NS. The Soga family had their mansion at the place called Shima,
and Soga Umako was known as Shima no Oho-omi. See Inoue Michiyasu, “Harima
fudoki,” in Kofudoki-shu, 2:20; and Kadowaki Teiji, Asuka: Sono kodaishi to fudo
(Tokyo: Nippon Hoso Shuppankyokai, 1970), 98; Nihongi, part 2, 38. See also
“Village of Wogaha,” below.
* Hiru of the Tatari no Kimi is said to have been a descendant of a king of Kara
(Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku, 311).
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 181
An attendant from Kamitsu Keno was sent to observe it more closely.
The attendant’s name was Manahiko. Manahiko reported that it was
rapids in a stream rushing down from the highlands. This is why it is
called the hamlet of Takase (rapid water).°°
The hamlet of Toyokuni was named after the god Toyokuni in
Tsukushi. The god Toyokuni resides in this hamlet. Thus, it is called
Toyokuni.*!
Agamano was named after an incident involving one of Prince
Homuda’s horses. While hunting in this field, the prince happened to
see one of his horses run away from the herd. Prince Homuda asked
whose horse it was. “That is the horse of Aga Kimi [my lord],” said a
gentleman-in-waiting. Thus, the place was named Agamano (field of
my horse).
The place where the prince let his huntsmen shoot their arrows at
that time was named Imesaki (target knoll). [The name was later
changed to Yumesaki.] The place where one bow was broken was
named Mayumi Woka (bow-tree hill). The hill on which the prince
stood was named Mitachiwoka (observation hill). The shooting [of
the arrows] caused a deer to emerge from the grove and jump into the
sea. The deer swam to the opposite shore. That is why the islands
were named Itoshima.* [In the sea there was a group of islands that
later came to be called Ito Shima.]
°° An attendant: The original graphs are usually read as toneri. In early Japan it
was customary for local chieftains to send their young sons to the Yamato Court as
a gesture of submission. These boys often became loyal attendants of the members
of the imperial family. Manahiko may well have been from Kamitsu Keno (front
Keno, present-day Gunma Prefecture), in the upper Tonegawa region. (The word
kamitsu literally means “upper,” indicating, in this instance, that this part of the
area or province is closer to the capital than the other. The counterpart of the word
is shimotsu, which literally means “lower.” It indicates that this part of the area or
province is farther from the capital than the one preceded by the word kamitsu.)
After the Taika Reform, the toneri came to constitute the lower aristocracy. It was
this class of men that supported Prince Ohoama (Emperor Tenmu) in the Jinshin
Insurgency (672-73) and led him to victory.
5! This is one of the tales that suggests the “west-to-east” migratory routes of the
early Japanese settlers. Toyokuni refers to the territory included in Buzen and
Bungo in the eighth century.
2 These islands are the present-day Yejima Gunto where old courting customs
were preserved until the 1950s (Aoki, Ancient Myths, 149-50).
182 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
Village of Abo. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average. }
Abo was named after the native place of the people who settled in
this area. They came from the hamlet of Abo in Iyo [on Shikoku
Island]. That is why it is called the village of Abo.
Village of Mino. {The village includes Tsugi no Minato.} The condition
of the soil is of the middle grade of the inferior class. Mino was named
after the native place of the settlers of this area. They came from the
district of Mino in Sanuki. It is therefore called Mino.
Tsugi no Minato was named after a man who possessed the extraordinary power [of theurgy]. Once upon a time, there was a dead
woman in this area. A man came and restored her life. This man is
said to have been the forebear of the Hi no Kimi in Tsukushi {but his
name is not known}. After restoring the dead woman to life, the man
married her. That is why the place is called Tsugi no Minato (([life-]
restoring/connecting haven).
Village of Idate. {The condition of the soil is about average.} Idate
was named after the god Idate who resides in this village. When
Princess Okinaga Tarashi desired to conquer Silla and mobilized her
army to cross the sea, the god Idate guarded the fleet. Because of this
god’s presence, the village is called Idate.*
Village of Anashi. {The condition of the soil is about average.} Anashi
was named after the god Anashi in the Yamato region. The entire
village of Anashi constitutes a kamube, or unit of shrine households,
of the Anashi Shrine. That is why the village is called Anashi.*
Village of Ayabe. {The village includes [the hamlets of] Tashino, Ahino,
and Tenugaha.} The etymology of this name is the same as that given
for the village of Ayabe [above. It is inhabited by immigrants and
their descendants].
Tashino was named after a gesture of Prince Homuda. When he
3 This man may have been a shaman.
* The god Idate is known to have been a war god with the power to control
seafaring.
® All the taxes collected in this village were allocated to the Anashi Shrine. I
have interpreted kamube as referring to a unit of shrine households based on its use
in the Izumo fudoki (see Aoki, Izwmo fudoki, 18, 28).
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 183
came upon this area, while on an inspection tour, Prince Homuda
raised his whip to point to this field, and said, “This is a good field in
which to build houses and cultivate.” That is why the place is called
Sashino (indicated field). The name has been altered to Tashino.
Ahino was named after the meeting of Prince Homuda and his
subjects. While the prince approached from the hillside, his subjects
[perhaps newly subjugated ones] arrived by sea. They met at this
place. That is why the place is called Ahino (meeting field).*
Tenugaha was named after a deed of Prince Homuda. While touring
the area, the prince washed his hands in this river. That is why it is
called Tenu (hand-wetting). {Ayu are obtained there. They are very
tasty. }
There is a pond called Umahaka at the northern foot of Funawoka
in the village of Iwa.*’ In the past, during the reign of Prince Ohohatsuse [posthumously known as Emperor Yuryaku], there lived a man
named Nagahiko, the forebear of the Wohari no Muraji. This man
had a nice maid and a good horse, and he was very pleased with both.
On his deathbed this man instructed his son regarding his funeral
[following which his maid and his horse were expected to die in memory
of their master]. The man said, “After my death be sure to conduct
all funerals in the same manner as mine.” The son accordingly constructed three tombs: one for his own father, one for his father’s maid,
and one for his father’s horse. Later, when Councillor Ofushi became
governor of Harima Province, he built dikes around the [horse’s] tomb.
That is why the water around the tomb is called Umahaka no Ike
(horse-tomb pond).
Shikama no Miyake. [Shikama no Miyake (the royal granary of Shikama) was established by Prince Ohosasagi in this district.] During
his reign, Prince Ohosasagi ordered a subject to fetch the kuni no miyatsuko of five provinces: Oki, Izumo, Hahaki [Hoki], Inaba, and Tajima.
°6 This area is in the rolling hills west of Himeji City where the San’indo Highway left the San’yodo Highway.
7 This paragraph rightly belongs in the section under the village of Iwa. Akimoto
believes that it contains supplementary information added after the rough draft of
the fudoki had been completed (Akimoto, Fudokino kenkyu, 247).
58 This tale describes the custom of self-immolation, which some scholars claim
did not exist in Japan.
184 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
These five magistrates forced the prince’s messengers to act as pilots
on their journey to the capital. [The prince was greatly offended by this.]”
Because of their offense, the five magistrates were banished to
Harima Province and confined to a prison workshop where they tilled
the royal granary land [their followers must have accompanied them].
The prisoners reclaimed the prince’s land. The rice fields thus created
were named Okita (the rice field of Oki), Izumota, Hahakita, Inabata,
and Tajimata. Since that time the Shikama no Miyake has collected
and stored the yields of these rice fields for royal use. The granary is
also called Kawaraku no Miyake (compensation granary).
District of Ihibo
The etymological explanation is provided later [in this section].
Ito Shima. This is the collective name for a group of islands. These
islands were named after an incident that occurred while Prince Homuda
was present. The prince conducted a hunting tour around the area.
He then had his huntsmen shoot arrows at Imesaki of Shikama. Thereupon a doe [startled by the shot] emerged from Agamano. It passed
the hill on which the prince stood and waded into the water.°!
The deer swam in the sea until it finally reached one of these islands.
The huntsmen saw this and said to each other, “[How very fast the
deer is!] It has already reached the island.” These islands came to be
known by the name of Ito [perhaps meaning “how very . . .”]®
Village of Kagwyama. {The former name was Kakuhaka (deer-coming
tomb).} The condition of the soil is of the upper grade of the inferior
class. The name Kakuhaka is [a kind of name in which two things are
combined:] the shape of this hill actually looks like a burial mound,
® Commentators differ in their readings of this prince’s name. The graphs mean
“large sparrow” or “wren.” Sakamoto, Inoue Michiyasu, and Hisamatsu read them
as ohosazaki, which can mean “wren.” Akimoto and Inoue Mitsusada read them
as ohosasagi, which can mean “grandiose burial mound.” My reading follows the
latter. On the word sazaki (wren), see Nihongi, part 1, 277-78.
© This story illustrates some of the tactics by which the unifiers of early Japan
gained power over local chieftains.
6! See note 52.
* The phrase translated as “how very” could also mean “already.”
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 185
{and legend tells us that] while the Great God of Iwa occupied the
area, a deer came and stood on top of this hill. It therefore came to be
called Kakuhaka. Later, in the time of Provincial Governor Chimori
no Omi, the name was changed to Kaguyama (fragrant hill).©
Yanuchi Dani [or Yanuchi Tani]. This is a dell in Kaguyama. Viewed from
this small valley, the surrounding [bluffs] have the appearance of an
enclosing fence. Therefore, it came to be known as Yanuchi Dani
(courtyard dell).
Hamlet of Sasa. While on an inspection tour, Prince Homuda came
upon this place and saw a monkey with a bamboo leaf in its mouth.
The village was named Sasa after the bamboo leaf.
Hamlet of Atsu. At one time the Great God of Iwa made an inspection
tour of this area. When he came to this hamlet he was suffering from
heartburn. He broke the cord fastening his clothes [in order to air his
chest]. That is how the place came to be called Atsu (burning hot).
Another theory suggests that the village got its name from [an
incident that occurred in the area]. Long ago there were two stars
shining in the sky. One day these stars fell to earth [at this place] and
became two rocks. The villagers gathered around the site to determine
what had happened to the stars. They had a heated discussion [about
these “fallen stars”]. That is why the place is called Atsu (abridgment
of agetsu, meaning “to discuss”).
Ihimori Yama. Ihimori was named after the spouse of the meal god in
the district of Utari in Sanuki. The goddess was called Ihimori no
Ohotoji (meal-serving dame). She came from across the sea to live on
this hill. Thus, it is called Ihimori (meal-serving).
Ohotori Yama. Bean geese (large wild geese) live on this hill. That is
why it is called Ohotori (big bird.)
6} The site of Kaguyama (or Kaku Yama) is the present-day Shingu City. The
original gives the graphs for Kakuhaka, which literally could mean “the grave to
which deer come/came.” The Chimori no Omi family is perhaps descended from
Korean immigrants who gained a moderately high position at the Yamato Court
(see Nihongi, part 2, 290; and Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku, 199.
64 Hisamatsu Sen’ichi suggests that storks are intended here rather than bean
geese. The original simply gives the graphs meaning “big bird” (fudoki [Hisamatsu], 131).
186 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
Village of Kurusu. {The condition of the soil is about average. } Kurusu
was named after a chestnut grove in this village. Prince Takatsu [posthumously known as Emperor Nintoku], who governed the realm from
Takatsu Palace in Naniha, ordered some peeled chestnuts to be presented in his name to Ikeko of the Waka Yamatobe no Muraji. Ikeko
thereupon retired from the Court to come to this place and plant the
royal gifts in the village. The chestnut trees grew, and thus the hamlet
was named Kurusu (chestnut grove). Chestnuts from this grove are
said to be free of bitterness [bitter skin] because the nuts were peeled
before they were planted.”
Kanaya Gaha. (winding river): This river was named after one of Prince
Homuda’s arrows. When the prince was here on an inspection tour,
one of his iron hunting arrows fell into the river. The incident gave
tise to the name Kanaya (iron arrow).©
Awi Yama. The mercury plant is obtained on this hill. Therefore, the
hill is called Awi (mercury plant). It was during the reign of Prince
Homuda that this plant was first found on the hill. Some unidentified
birds come to stay there. They stay from the first to the fourth month.
After the fifth month they fly away. The shape of the birds resembles
that of doves, and their color is dark blue.*’
Village of Koshibe. [The former name was Mikoshiro no Sato.] The
condition of the soil is about average. Mikoshiro was named after
land given to the people who were settled in the village as royal serfs.
During the reign of Prince Magari, Wotsu of the Tajima no Kami was

Waka Yamatobe family.

Kanaya Gaha. Akimoto believes them to be a kind of footnote describing the river.
[have followed him, and interpret the passage to mean “iron arrow.”
*’ Mercury plant: The original has graphs to which Hisamatsu gives the reading
kure no awi (abbreviated as kurenai). If he is correct, this plant is Carthamus tinctorius
L., namely, the safflower. Although the color of its flower is orange, the dye extracted from the dried safflower is dark red. Another name of this flower is suyetsumu
hana, which later was adopted as the name of one of the heroines in the Tale of
Genji.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 187
accorded princely favor and endowed with the title of Mikoshiro no
Kimi (chief of the royal serfs). He was made supervisor of the royal
granary, which was newly established in this village. That is why the
place was called the hamlet of Mikoshiro.®
Later, when Councillor Kamitsu Keno was governor of Harima Province, this hamlet grew and the number of households increased to as
many as thirty [a number insufficient to constitute a village]. Therefore,
Councillor Kamitsu Keno, who was the governor of Harima Province,
grouped the thirty households together and called [the resulting unit]
Koshibe (surplus households). That is why it is now called Koshibe no
Sato (village composed of surplus households).”
According to another version, the residents in this area came from
[a] mtyake, in the land of Tajima, to settle in the hamlet, hence [the
name] Koshibe (relocated people).””
Sagisumi Yama. Sagisumi was named for the numerous herons that
once came to this hill. Thus Sagisumi (heron-living) became the name
of the hill.
Tanakura Yama. The rocks of this hill are piled up like shelves. Therefore, the hills are called Tanakura (shelves).
Mihashi Yama. The god Ohonamuchi piled bags of rice here in order
to make stairs. In fact, the rocks on this hillside are piled up in such a
6 Prince Magari: It is significant that this prince’s name is recorded here. Although he is posthumously known as Emperor Ankan (r. 534-357), his reign must
have been nominal, or at least only partially recognized in some localities. We can
infer from this portion of the text that Prince Magari was accepted as the sovereign
by the local people of this area. There is some debate over how to translate the
word koshiro, or mikoshiro. I have followed John W. Hall’s interpretation in his
Government and Local Power in Japan, 39, 56. See also Kida Teikichi, “Keitai Tenno
ika san-tenno koi keisho ni kansuru gimon,” Rekishi chiri 52, no. 1 (July 1928): 1-29.
6 Note that the NS mentions Kamitsu Keno in connection with Prince Magari
(see Nihongi, part 2, 31). The suffix be of Koshibe signifies that these people were
workers serving the royal family (Hirano, Taika zandai shakai soshiki no kenkyu,
130). For evidence of a similar grouping, see the section under amaribe in Aoki,
Izumo fudoki, 11, 86.

way that they look like stairs. That is why the hill was named Mihashi
(august stairs).”!
Hamlet of Sano. The forebear of Tamate of the Wake no Kimi was
originally from Izumo District in Kahachi Province. His birthplace,
however, was not a desirable place to live, so he decided to move.
When Tamate arrived here in search of good land, he said, “This
land is rather narrow but it looks like a good place for me to settle.”
Thus, it was named Sano (narrow field) .”
Village of Kami Woka.{The old name was Hayashida no Sato.} The
condition of the soil is slightly below average. Kami Woka was named
after a deed of the Great God Abo from Izumo. This god heard that
three hills in Yamato—Unebi, Kagu, and Miminashi—were fighting
each other [for supremacy]. The Great God Abo, wishing to intercede,
set out for Yamato. When the god reached this area, he learned that
the three contenders had already stopped fighting. [Learning of the
peace settlement among the three, the Great God Abo saw no need
to proceed further.] He capsized the boat in which he was travelling
and decided to stay. The site of the capsized boat is called Kami Woka
(god’s hill). The shape of this hill really looks like a capsized boat.”
[Sugafu Yama.] Sedge grows all around this hill. This gave rise to the
name Sugafu Yama (sedge-growing hill). According to another tradition,
™ See “Village of Yake,” under the “District of Inami,” above.
” Probably Wake no Kimi was related to Prince Homuda. The prince’s full
name was Homudawake. According to recent studies, Wake derives from the
suffix of Homudawake. See Ueda Masaaki, “Yamato kokka no kozo,” in Nihon
reskishi: kodai 2 (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1962), 30.
® The Yamato version of the tale has a more romantic flavor. In this story, there
are three hills in the Yamato Basin, where the capital towns were located in the
seventh and eighth centuries. Two of the three hills were believed to be male, the
third female. The two male hills contended for the female’s favor. The tale refers
to the intricate love affairs of two brothers, Prince Naka and Prince Ohoama
(Emperors Tenji and Temmu, respectively). The brothers loved the same beauty,
Princess Nukata, who left many love poems in the Man’yoshu. In her prime, she was
in love with Prince Ohoama. But when Prince Naka ascended the throne a love
triangle allegedly developed. Eventually Prince Ohoama withdrew from the affair,
According to some historians, the Jinshin Insurgency of 672 resulted from the
personal hatred between the brothers.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 189
it was named after words Prince Homuda uttered while he was on an
inspection tour in the area. The prince ordered a well dug at the foot
of the hill. The water of the well was very clear and cold. [After
drinking this good water,] Prince Homuda said, “My mind is refreshed
by this clear, chilled water.” That is how the place came to be called
Sugafu (richly refreshing).
Tono Woka. A palace was built on this hill. Thus, it is called Tono
Woka (palace hill). Oak trees grow there.
Village of Kusakabe. {The village is named after a man’s surname. }
The condition of the soil is about average.
Tachino. [The former name was Kusakabeno.] In the past, Nomi no
Sukune, a fashioner of clay images for funerals, was returning home
[from Yamato] to the land of Izumo. He spent the night at Kusakabeno
where he became ill and eventually died. [Upon his death, the people
of Izumo were summoned.] They came from Izumo, formed a line from
the riverbed [of Ihibo Gaha] to Kusakabeno, and passed pebbles by
relay from the river to the burial site. There they constructed a burial
mound using these pebbles. Because the people of Izumo lined up
around Kusakabeno to construct a tomb, the area came to be called
Tachino (standing field). The grave itself is called Izumo no Hakaya
(Izumo tomb).”
Village of Hayashida. {The former name was Ihanashi.} The condition
of the soil is slightly below average. When he came to this land for the
first time, the Great God of Iwa stuck [a twig] into the ground at this
site to mark it as his territory. The twig grew tall and became an
4 The Chinese graphs in the editor’s (Akimoto’s) note and the ones given at
the end of the statement differ, hence the difference in the meanings.
This description strongly suggests that travellers between the Izumo and
Yamato regions followed a route that passed through Harima Province. Nomi no
Sukune: He is known to have been a funeral director for the royal house and for
other nobles in Yamato. When he became old, he probably retired from the Court
and planned to return home, dying on the way. According to the native cult of
Japan, a man’s dead soul cannot be appeased unless his people recite the proper
prayers. The NS contains a poem suggesting a similar way of carrying rocks by
hand: “If one passed from hand to hand / The rocks / Built up / On Ohosaka, /
How hard ‘twould be to send them” (Nihongi, part 1, 159).

imposing elm tree. That is why the place used to be called Ihanashi
(elm tree).’°
Matsuwo Woka. When Prince Homuda arrived at this hill on an inspection tour, the sun set and darkness fell. He collected pine branches
from the hill and made a torch. That is why the place came to be
called Matsuwo (pine’s tail).
Shiho Woka. There is a spring on the south side of this hill. It is about
thirty feet square. The site of the spring is about ten miles from the
seashore, yet the water is salty and it rises and falls with the tide. At
high tide, the water is about three inches deep. Pebbles line the bottom
and grass grows on the edge. Animals such as bovines, horses, and
deer are fond of this water. Because [the water contains salt,] the hill
is called Shiho Woka (salt hill).
{Iseno.} Ise [was named after two guardian deities of the newcomers
who came to this area. These deities are Isetsuhiko and Isetsuhime].
Every time newcomers attempted to settle in this area they would
suffer great misfortune. The immigrant families[, however, wanted to
stay]. These were the forebears of Ite of the Kinunuhi (dressmakers)
and Tora of the Ayahito and their people. Because they desired to
settle in this area, they built a shrine to the two deities of Ise at the
foot of this hill. The deities [enshrined on the ridge of this hill] are
the god and goddess Ise, the children of the Great God of Iwa. After
consecrating the shrine of these deities, [the newcomers] prospered
and the number of their households increased. Thus originated the
name Ise.”
Ise Gaha. The river was named after the Ise deities.
Inadane Yama [Inatane Yama]. The two deities, Ohonamuchi and
Sukuna Hikone, were on the ridge of Ikuno in the village of Hani
Woka, of Kamusaki District, [when] they looked upon these hills and

" Tsetsuhiko and Isetsuhime: Tsu in Isetsuhiko is genitive. The suffix hiko connotes the masculine and hime the feminine, hence the “god of Ise” and the “goddess of Ise.”
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 191
said, “Lo, those hills would be a good place to store rice stalks.” They
sent for rice stalks and had them piled up there. The shape of these
hills is like rice stalks piled high. That is why they are called Inatane
Yama (rice seed or rice stalk hills).”
Village of Ohochi {Posting- Station}. The condition of the soil is slightly
below average. [Ohochi was named for the words of Prince Homuda.]
When the prince came upon this place while on an inspection tour,
he commented on this land, saying, “Though I imagined it as a narrow
land, this is indeed a large tract of enclosed land.” Because of this, it
is named Ohouchi (large enclosed [land]).”
Hiyama. There [was once] a spring on the east side of this hill. When
Prince Homuda attempted to ladle water from this spring, it was frozen
over. That is why the hill was named Hiyama (freezing hill).
Tsukiwore Yama. Prince Homuda went hunting on this hill. He attempted to shoot a running boar with his bow made from a zelkova
tree. However, the bow snapped [before the arrow could be launched].
The incident gave rise to the name Tsukiwore Yama (zelkova-breaking,
or bow-snapping, hill). There is a rock cavern on the south side of this
hill. Cattail grows inside the cave. Thus, the place is called Kama
Woka (cattail hill). The cattail has never ceased to grow [there].
Village of Hiroyama. {The former name was the hamlet of Tsuka.}
The condition of the soil is slightly above average. Tsuka was named
for a deed of the goddess Ihatatsu-Hime. This deity stood in the grove
of Hatawi, in the hamlet of Izumi, and shot arrows in several directions.
All the arrows she shot toward this place stuck deep in the ground,
with only the ends protruding. [The part protruding was about as long
as] a man’s fist. Therefore, the place was called the hamlet of Tsuka
8 Inatane Yama (or Inadane Yama): At the beginning of the section the original
gives graphs meaning “rice seed hills.” At the end it gives graphs that could mean
“hills where rice stalks are piled high.” The inconsistency seems to reflect a change
of connotation in the word meaning “rice seeds.” In early times, Japanese farmers
stored rice seeds with the stalks attached. Later they changed their method of
storage, keeping only the grains to be used as seeds in the following season.
79 Posting-station of Ohochi: This is the site of the present-day Himeji City.

(fist). The name was changed to the village of Hiroyama when Prince
Ishikaha was serving as the commissioner of this area.*°
Asauchi Yama. Once upon a time, Marahi of the Izushi no Kimi, a
resident of Tajima, lived on this hill. Two women from this man’s household died one night while beating hemp. They died with beaten hemp
on their chests, giving rise to the name Asauchi Yama (hemp-beating
hill). Today the residents around this hill never beat hemp after nightfall. People say that in Sanuki. . 2!
Oshi Kaha. It was during the reign of Prince Homuda that the Great
Goddess Mikage of Izumo resided in Kamiwo Yama at the village of
Hirakata. She harassed travellers in this area, killing half of them and
sparing half. Three men—Kohote of Hahaki (Hoki), Fukuro of Inaba,
and Tsukiya of Izumo—discussed the matter and appealed to the royal
court for help. Kutoto of the Nukatabe no Muraji was sent [by Prince
Homuda] to offer prayers to appease the goddess. Kutoto constructed
an altar for prayer at Yakatada and established a winery at Sasa Yama
for the ceremony. People feasted and enjoyed the occasion. They decorated their waists with oak leaves and walked down to the river jostling
each other. This ritual gave rise to the name Oshi (pushing).
Village of Hirakata. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average. }
Hirakata was named after the native place of the people who settled
8° Prince Ishikaha was the governor of the “old” Kibi and Harima regions.
Commissioners (or early territorial governors—certainly those of post-Taika period) ruled larger areas than those assigned to the governors of the eighth-century
provinces. A commissioner’s position is understood to have been similar to that of a
viceroy. According to the NS, Prince Ishikaha served as the commissioner of Kibi
and Harima until his death in 680 (Nihongi, part 2, 341; see also HIT, note 3).
‘! There is a play on words in the name Asauchi. The first part, asa, has two
connotations: hemp and morning. Thus, asauchi can be translated two ways, as
“beating hemp” or as “beating [hemp] in the morning.” The rest of the text is
missing but it probably would have continued with something like “a similar tale
was handed down by the elders in Sanuki.”
*’ This legend seems to constitute an explanation of an existing local festival.
Note that those concerned with the problem were not Harima residents but the
residents of neighboring areas. These areas were located in the San’in Circuit
while Harima was in the San’yo Circuit. The tale hints at conflict between the
San’in and San’yo circuits (see note’75).
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 193
in this area. Immigrants from Hirakata village in Mamuta District,
which is in Kahachi Province, settled here first. Thus, the place was
named Hirakata.*
Sahi Woka. [Sahi was named for the sahi (plough) that was made
for sacrificial use to appease the violent deity of this area]. The Great
Goddess of Izumo, who is now enshrined at Kamiwo Yama, was quite
violent [at one time]. Whenever travellers from Izumo passed through
the area, this goddess killed half of them: five out of ten, three out of
five. The Izumo [immigrants] made a plough to dedicate to the goddess
in an attempt to appease her. [The plough, however, was ineffective; ]
the goddess was not appeased.
There is a reason [why the goddess of Izumo was so spiteful toward
Izumo men. In the remote past] a god of [Izumo] came to this place.
His goddess followed him. The male deity was disturbed [by her appearance in his new land] and he deserted her. The female deity was
so enraged [that she determined to harm the Izumo people in reprisal].
Later, immigrants from the village of Hirakata, of Mamuta District in
Kahachi Province, came to the foot of this hill. These people respectfully prayed to the goddess, [begging for a peace settlement,] and
[finally] they were successful. Because the goddess resides here, the hill
is called Kamiwo (goddess’s feet). Sahi Woka was named for the [ineffective] plough that the [Izumo people] dedicated to the goddess.
Sawoka. Sawoka was named after the annual rice-planting festival
held there. During his reign, Prince Takatsu sent for peasants from
Tsukushi to create rice fields in this area. Every year in the fifth month
the farmers would gather around this hill for a feast celebrating the
annual rice-planting ritual. That is why the hill is called Sawoka
(rice-planting hill).*
83 This must have been a group of people called the Imaki no Ayahito (newly
arrived immigrants). According to the SSR, the land of Mamuta in Kahachi was
given to a group of immigrants headed by a man named Ofukamuki who claimed
to be a descendant of the royal family of the Kingdom of Wu in southern China
(Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku, 325; Hirano, Taika zendai shakai soshiki no kenku, 183-84).

techniques.

translated as “workers in the rice fields,” tabe. This story indicates that the royal

Ohomi Yama. Ohomi was named for a deed of Prince Homuda. The
prince climbed to the top of this hill so that he could see in all four
directions. This is why it is called Ohomi (grand viewing). The prince
stood on a huge boulder about three feet tall, thirty feet long, and
twenty feet wide. Some concave spots on the stone are said to be his
footprints and the traces of his walking stick.
Misaki Yama. Three promontories protrude [northward] from this hill.
They are so conspicuous that people began to call the place Misaki
Yama (three-forked hill).
Mitachi Woka. Prince Homuda went to the top of this hill to view his
country. Thus, it was named Mitachi Woka (noble-standing hill).
Village of Ohoyake. {Its former name was Ohomiya.} The condition of
the soil is slightly above average. When he came to this area on an
inspection tour, Prince Homuda built his palace in this village. That
is why it was named Ohomiya (grand palace). Later, Councillor Tanaka
changed its name to Ohoyake (great mansion) when he was the governor of Harima Province.*®
Ohonori Yama. {The present name is Suguribe Woka.} Prince Homuda
promulgated an important code on this hill. This is how the hill came
to be called Ohonori (grand code). The reason why it is now called
Suguribe Woka [is stated below]. During her reign, Princess Kahara
of Woharita [posthumously known as Empress Suiko] commissioned
the Suguribe people of Chiyo, in Yamato, to reclaim the area. The
Suguribe settled at the foot of this hill. Because they lived in this
area, [the hill is also] called Suguribe Woka.*’
family maintained a stronghold in Tsukushi (Kyushu) sometime around the early
fifth century. It is widely accepted that Prince Takatsu is a historical figure who
sent envoys to the Chinese court around 421. At this time the planting of rice
seedlings was an advanced farming technique. Before it was introduced, rice
seeds were sown directly on the ground (see glossary, under tabe).
8° Councillor Tanaka was a relative of the Soga family (Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku, 174).
87 The Suguribe were from Paekche. In the original text, the subject of the sentence
that begins with the expression “During her reign . .. commissioned” is unclear. I
have interpreted it to mean that Empress Suiko (r. 593-628) is referred to. Note
that this part of the HAR uses Suiko’s name to express time, while another section
indicates the time by mentioning Prince Shotoku’s name. See “Village of Ohokuni,”
under the “District of Inami,” above; and Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku, 303, 309-10.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 195
Kamihako Woka, Shimohako Woka, Nahetsu, and Afukota. During the
reign of Prince Uji, the Takanashi brothers, who were the forebears of the
Uji no Muraji, asked that the place called Yofuto, in the hamlet of Ohotabe, be given to them. [The land was granted by Prince Uji.] When
the Takanashi brothers arrived to reclaim the land, one of their servants
carried the cooking utensils by means of a pole on his shoulder.**
When the servant arrived at this place, the pole broke and the
utensils fell to the ground. Thus, the place where the pans dropped
was named Nahetsu (destination of the pan). Likewise, the place
where the box attached to the front of the pole fell was named Kamihako Woka (front-box hill). The place where the box attached to the
back of the pole dropped was called Shimohako Woka (back-box hill).
The place where the pole fell was named Afukota (pole land).
Village of Ohota. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average. }
Ohota was named after the hamlet of Ohota where Korean immigrants
settled. In ancient times, Suguri of Kure came from Kara [the southern
Korean Peninsula] to settle in the hamlet of Ohota of Nagusa District
in the land of Ki. Sometime later, a branch of this family moved to the
village of Ohota of Kami [the eighth-century Mishima District] in
Settsu. From here, still another branch moved to the hamlet of Ohota
of Ihibo District. Because the original Suguri family had settled in a
place called Ohota, their branch families also called their farmland
Ohota. *
Kotoage Woka. Kotoage was named for the words of Princess Oho
[Okinaga] Tarashi. When she was about to dispatch her army to fight
in the area, the princess gathered her troops on this hill and gave
88 The Uji no Muraji were related to the Mononobe family. In 684, they were
given anew title, sukune (Nihongi, part 2, 367; Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku, 237, 272).
Prince Uji: The original reads Uji no Sumeramikoto. According to the NS, he was
Prince Homuda’s heir apparent. But when Homuda died Uji declined to ascend
the throne, recommending Prince Ohosazaki (Emperor Nintoku) instead. The
tale in the NS is suggestive of power struggles that arose after Homuda’s death (see
Nihongi, part 1, 272-77).
8° Suguri of Kure: Kure no Suguri. Among those who were accepted as immigrants from the southern Korean Peninsula some came from China by way of
Paekche. Kure is an archaic Korean word meaning “the cultured,” namely, China,
and/or the Chinese.
196 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
them instructions. She said, “This war should be carried out stealthily.
It must not be declared beforehand.” Thus, the place came to be
known as Kotoage Saki (prior declaration/declaration hill).”°
Tsudzumi Yama. Long ago, Ise of the Nukatabe no Muraji fought Tamo
[Fukuta] of the Hara, who was the miwabito at this place. They began
their battles with the beating of drums. Thus, the hill was named
Tsudzumi (drum-sounding hill). {The spindle tree grows in the valley
below this hill. }%
Village of Ihami. {The condition of the soil is excellent.} Ihami was
named after the native place of the laborers who opened this area. During
the reign of the emperor [posthumously known as Emperor Kotoku
who governed the realm from] Toyosaki [Palace] at Nagara in Naniha,
an unusually bountiful crop of rice grew in the vast field of this village.
Momotari of the Azumi no Muraji harvested the crop and dedicated
it to the emperor. Thereupon, the emperor issued an edict, declaring,
“It is fitting to reclaim this land and make it into a rice field.” Thus,
the emperor commissioned Tamu of the Adzumi no Muraji to recruit
laborers from Ihami Province. That is why the village came to be
called Ihami, and the rice field Momotari.”
Sakawino. Sakawi was named after a well dug for a sake brewery.
*° Okinaga Tarashi: The original has graphs that may be read as Ohotarashi
Hime no Mikoto. I have amended the name according to the suggestions of the
majority of Japanese commentators. However, the identification of this woman in
terms of the imperial genealogy may not be significant. More important is the
implication that belligerent female chieftains such as this one existed in the Japanese
Islands.
*! Tamo of the Hara: The identification of this name is tentative, for no Japanese
commentator has achieved a conclusive reading. Miwabito: The original has graphs
that could mean “god’s people.” This probably refers to a wizard or a family of
theurgists. In medieval Japan, the same graphs were read as shinjin (in a SinoJapanese reading). The term referred to people affiliated with ecclesiastical institutions such as Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples (see Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku, 258).
” According to the SSR (ibid., 268), the Adzumi no Muraji family was descended from the sea god Watatsumi. This probably means that they were originally
seafarers. The “laborers” from Ihami Province were probably conscripted workers,
or yoboro.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 197
Prince Homuda constructed a palace in the village of Ohoyake, dug
a well, and established a sake brewery in this field. Therefore, the
place was named Sakawino (field of the rice-wine well).
Usukitsu. Princess Oho [Okinaga] Tarashi came upon this place while
she was en route to an overseas campaign in Kara. She anchored her
fleet overnight in the sheltered mouth of the Uzu River. From this
haven she proceeded toward Itsu. On the way to Itsu the fleet encountered an adverse wind and could not proceed. Under the circumstances
the princess decided to drag the boats across the place called Funakoshi
and continue overland. But the wind was so strong that the boats
could not be pulled. The princess then mobilized the local peasants to
help pull the boats. Among them was a woman who was eager to
present her son to the princess as a servant. This woman was in such
haste to reach the princess that she fell into the water. That is why
the ford is called Usukitsu (ford of making haste). {Today, the [Japanese]
say isusuku to mean “make haste.” }%?
Uzu Gaha (swirling river). Uzu was named after swirling waves on the
west side of Usukitsu. Princess Okinaga Tarashi anchored her fleet at
[one of the fords of] this river.
Hamlet of Itsu. Itsu was named for words spoken by the princess’s sailors,
who said, “Itsu (how soon) can we return to see this place again?”
That is why the village is called Itsu (when/how soon).
Suzume Shima (sparrow island). This island was so named because a
large number of sparrows gather there. {No plants grow there.}
Village of Urakami. {The condition of the soil is about average. }
Urakami was named after the birthplace of Momotari of the Azumi no
Muraji. Formerly this man resided at Urakami of Naniha. He later
moved to this area. Thus, the place came to be known by the name of
the man’s place of origin, Urakami.”
3 Funakoshi, or Funagoshi: A similar story is found in the description of the
“Village of Ahaha,” under the “District of Kako,” above. The child must have
been presented as a hostage or an attendant.
For the Azumi no Muraji family, see note 92.
198 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
Mitsu. This place provided shelter to the fleet of Princess Okinaga
Tarashi. That is why it is called Mitsu (honored anchorage).”
Murofu no Tomari (shelter of Murofu). This shelter is so situated that
wind is prevented from blowing in. It prevents drafts in the manner of a
cellar. It is therefore called Murofu no Tomari (“shelter like a cellar”).*°
Ofu no Ura. In ancient times ofu (white clams) were obtained there.
It therefore is called Ofu no Ura (white-clam beach).
Ihe Shima. Quite a few people live on these islands and there are
many houses there. That is why they are called Ihe Shima (house
islands). {Bamboo and arrowroot grow there.}
Kami Shima. This island is located east of Ito Shima [former name of
Ihe Shima]. Kami Shima was named after a stone [statue] of a deity
located on the west side of this island. It is shaped like an image of
the Buddha. The island got its name of Kami Shima (deity island)
from this stone deity. There are five different-colored jewels set into
the face of this image. Several other jewels are set into its chest. It
looks as though the deity is crying [shedding colored tears on its face
and chest]. One might well wonder why the image looks as if it is
crying. [Naturally,] there is a story behind it, as follows.
During the reign of Prince Homuda, a visitor from Silla came to
his Court. The visitor saw this statue and reckoned the jewels to be
priceless. He crushed the face in order to remove one of the eyes,
severely damaging it. The stone deity was enraged at this act and
caused a violent wind to rise. Shipwrecked, the visitor’s boat drifted
toward the south shore of Taka Shima where it sank. All the passengers
were drowned. The dead were buried on the beach. Thus, the beach
was named Kara Hama (Korean beach). Today, those who pass through
this area are careful not to mention the people of Kara or those who
are blind. [Perhaps this is because the stone deity was “blinded.”]%”
»® The early connotation of tsu (in the name Mitsu) was “anchorage.” Later it
also came to mean “ford.”
*° The meaning is that the sea was calm since the spot was sheltered from the
wind.
*” Visitor from Silla: This probably was an emissary sent to present tribute to the
Japanese Court. The tone of the tale suggests its date, for it sounds as if it was
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 199
Karani Shima. The belongings of the people drowned in the [abovementioned] shipwreck drifted to the shore of this island. It therefore
was named Karani Shima (Korean cargo island).
Taka Shima. This island is higher than the others in this area. It therefore is called Taka Shima (tall island).
Village of Hagihara. {The condition of the soil is about average. }
Hagihara was named after the bush clover, which began growing there
during the stay of Princess Okinaga Tarashi who was on her way home
from her expeditionary campaign in Kara. She had her fleet anchor at
[the shore of] this village. During the night the bush clover grew as
tall as ten feet. That is why the village was named Hagihara (bushclover field). [Observing this unusual phenomenon,] the princess and
her subjects dug a well near the bush clover and [ordered that] the
space around the clover and the well be left untouched. That is why
the well is called Harimawi (well in an unreclaimed tract).
The well was built in the Korean style with a barrel installed in
which underground water could collect. Because the well was Korean
in style, people gave it the alternate name of Kara Shimizu (Korean
water). The water of this well was abundant [accumulating day and
night]. The princess had a sake brewery built nearby. This site was
named Sakata (sake field). Once one of the brewery barrels overturned and was emptied. Thus, the place came to be called Katabukita
(overturned field).”
[Near the brewery site was a place where] young girls [processed
sake] by crushing rice. The princess’s subjects married these maidens.
created after the enmity between Silla and Japan worsened. This entry seems to
reflect the armed conflict of 663 in which Japan was defeated in a sea battle waged
against Silla and T’ang forces. Also note that indigenous Japanese beliefs do not
emphasize icons. Tales such as this one betray a Buddhist influence on the storytellers’ knowledge and mentality.
°8 Hagihara: Inoue Michiyasu suggests that the name of this village was actually
Harihara since the word meaning “bush clover” is hari in archaic Japanese. In any
case, the word hari seems to have been incorporated into the name of the province,
Harima (Inoue Michiyasu, Harima fudoki shinko, 284).
” The word Kara later came to mean “China,” as in Kara-mono (imported from
China).
200 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
Thus, the place was named Hototachita (first-night field). Around
Hototachita bush clover grew abundantly. Thus, the area came to be
called Hagihara. The deity enshrined there is Sukuna Tarashi.'° .
Suzukuhi Woka. This hill is called Suzukuhi [Woka] because of [one
of Prince Homuda’s hunting trips in the area. During his reign,] Prince
Homuda engaged in falconry on this hill. [The hill was named after
an incident in which] one of his falcons dropped its bell to the ground.
The bell was never found despite [an earnest search] —thus, the name
Suzukuhi Woka (bell-eating hill).
Village of Woyake. {The former name was Ayabe no Sato.} The condition of the soil is the middle grade of the inferior class. Ayabe was so
named because immigrants lived in this village. The name was later
changed to Woyake. The reason for the change [is described below].
The grandfather of Wakasa, of the Kahara family, married a daughter
of the Hata no Kimi of Woyake and named his house Woyake. Later,
Chimaro, the grandson of Wakasa, was [elevated to the position of]
head of the village. Upon this, the village was named Woyake. [The
event took place] in the year of Kanoye Tora [690].!°!
Shitadami Gaha. Shitadami was named after the small clams once
found in this river. Farmers dug irrigation ditches for the rice fields in
this area. There were a large number of small, fresh-water clams in
the ditches. The ditches later formed a small river. Thus, the river
was named Shitadami (small clams).
Village of Ihibo. {The condition of the soil is about average.} Ihibo
was named after the hill in this village. Because the hill is called
'© This story implies the existence of communal marriage. See also HIT, under
the districts of Kashima and Tsukuha.
'°! Wakasa of the Kahara family: According to the SSR, this family was descended from Prince Ch’en Ssu, the son of Wu-ti of the kingdom of Wei. Though
the family’s ancestral background may be fictitious, the tale introduced here may
shed light on the rise of “powerful” local chieftains on the strength of “arranged
marriages.” Note that the progenitor of the Kahara family, the grandfather of
Wakasa, married a girl of the Hata no Kimi and took the name of the girl’s place of
origin, Woyake (junior house), as the name of his own house (i.e., of his family).
This is one of the earliest known records of family-name adoption by an adult male
(Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku, 322-23; Nihongi, part 2, 36-37).
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 204
Thibo Yama (rice-grain hill), the village came to be called Ihibo no
Sato (village of rice grains).
Thibo Woka. thiho was named after the rice dropped atop this hill.
When he arrived from Kara (Korea), Ame no Hihoko (Prince of the
Shining Halberd) asked Ashihara no Shikowo (Ugly Man in the Reed
Field) to give him shelter at the mouth of the Uzu River.!”
“I wish to find a place where I can stay the night,” said the Prince
of the Shining Halberd. “You are the lord of this land. [Provide me
with a shelter].” However, Ugly Man in the Reed Field did not allow
the prince to come ashore. Thereupon, the prince god stirred the sea
with his sword to form a whirlpool and sat on top of it. After witnessing
this valorous feat, the Ugly Man became afraid of the prince. He saw
that he must secure his priority over the area. He therefore climbed
to the top of Ihibo Woka and ate some rice [for its magical effect]. In
so doing, he dropped a few grains of rice from his mouth. That is how
the hill came to be called Ihibo (grain of rice). All the pebbles on this
hill resemble grains of rice.!%
[In the meantime,] the native god stuck his walking stick into the
ground. Water sprang from the spot and began flowing north and
south. The northern stream is cold, and the southern stream is warm.
{The wokera plant grows there. }!%
102 Ame no Hihoko and Ashihara no Shikowo: Ame no Hihoko represents
newcomers (immigrants) to this area. Ashihara no Shikowo represents the local
people who were already settled there when the newcomers arrived. It is reasonable
to interpret this story as a reflection of conflict between the indigenous leadership
and an intruding power (see note 133; and Saunders, “Japanese Mythology,” 427).
'03 To partake of a meal was felt to have a magical effect on the ability to control
land. This ritual must have been practiced by chieftains in many areas. The one
who first performed it probably gained priority over the land involved. Note that
even today a part of the Japanese emperor’s accession ceremony, daijo-sai, includes sucha “rice-eating” ritual. See Bock, Engi-shiki, 15, 22, 26, 41, 59; Felicia G.

Kami Yama. There is a stone [statue of a] deity on this hill. Therefore,
the place is called Kami Yama (god’s hill). {Pasania trees grow there.
Pasania nuts grow during the eighth month.}
Village of Izumi. There is a cold spring in this village. The village is
identified with this spring and therefore is called Izumi. {The condition
of the soil is about average. }!%
Minashi Gaha. Minashi was named after the outcome of a water fight
between two deities in this area. The god Ihatatsu and the goddess
Ihatatsu, children of the great god of Iwa, fought over the water of
this river. The brother god wanted the river to flow north toward the
village of Koshibe, while the sister god wanted to direct it south toward the village of Izumi. The male deity broke off the ridge of the
hill [so that the river would flow north]. Upon seeing this the goddess,
thinking [her brother’s conduct] unreasonable, used her [magical]
comb to block the water and dig a ditch, directing the river southward toward the village of Izumi.! [Thus, their quarrel continued.]
The male deity then went around to [the south side of the village
of] Izumi and devised a scheme to make the water flow toward the
hamlet of Kuhahara in the west. But the goddess never capitulated.
She constructed an underground water pipe so that more of the river
water reached the rice field belonging to the hamlet of Izumi. Because
of this, the original river dried up. Therefore, it is called Minashi,
meaning “waterless.”!”
Village of Kuhahara. {The former name of the village was Kurami.}
'05 Akimoto reports (NKBT 2, 306) that the Sanjo-Nishi Text, which he uses as
his basic text, has the condition of the soil described at the end of the etymology of
this village. He amended the text as it appears in this translation, that is, he placed
the description immediately after the name of the village.
'6 As the comb was a shamanistic charm, the story testifies to a Japanese
association with shamanism. The gods concerned are [hatatsuhiko and Ihatatsuhime.
'°T This story must reflect actual fights over water. With the adoption of more
advanced rice-farming techniques, irrigation became a crucial factor. The story
reveals that the fight was won by people who developed the ability to make underground water pipes.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 203
The condition of the soil is slightly above average. When he stood
atop Tsukiwore Yama to view the surrounding territory, Prince Homuda
saw the tall granary buildings [that belonged to him]. He therefore
named the village Kurami (granary-viewing). The name has since
been altered to Kuhahara.
[There is another version of this etymology.] According to the
elders, members of the Kuhahara no Suguri stole saddles in the district
of Sayo. The owner of the saddles followed and accused them of the
theft when they came to this village. Thus, the place was called Kurami
(saddle-revealing) .!°°
Koto Saka. Koto Saka was named for a zither that was played there.
During the reign of Prince Ohotarashi a traveller from Izumo rested
at the pass on this hill. [While resting, he heard about] an old man
who made his living tilling rice fields with his daughter at the foot of
the hill. The Izumo visitor wished to win the girl’s heart, and he serenaded her with his koto (zither). Therefore, the pass was named Koto
Saka (zither pass). The site produces copper-bearing rocks shaped
like the dice used to play sugoroku.!”
District of Sayo
Sayo was named for the season of rice planting. When the two great
deities, the Great God and the Great Goddess Tamatsuhime, competed, expanding their territories, the goddess slaughtered a deer,
opened its bowels, and sowed rice seeds in the blood [to obtain fastgrowing seedlings]. The seedlings sprouted overnight. The goddess
108 Perhaps both of the parties involved in this story were immigrants. Obviously
the people of the district of Sayo were adept at saddle making while the people of
the Kuhahara no Suguri were not. Note that Soga Iruka, who was killed by Prince
Naka (later Emperor Tenji) in 645, was known as the chief of the saddle makers.
The rise of the Soga family at the Yamato Court coincided with a marked improvement in saddlery in the Japanese Islands.
109 Probably the traveller was a sorcerer. In the Japanese myths the koto (zither)
plays a role comparable to that of Orpheus’s lyre in the Orphic tradition. Sugoroku
was a popular pastime during the Heian period (794-1192). See Ivan Morris, The
World of the Shining Prince (New York: Knopf, 1964), 150-51.
204 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
then transplanted them. [This act signified her victory over the great
god. It was the fifth month of the year.]'"®
“You have indeed transplanted the seedlings during the sayo (the
evening in this early season),” said the great god. [He thus acknowledged that he had been defeated by the goddess’s advanced farming
techniques] and he left for another place. His words gave rise to the
name Sayo. [Sayo later came to mean “a night in the fifth month.”]
Thus, the district was named Sayo.
Likewise, the goddess acquired a new name, Sayotsuhime (beauty
of Sayo). Even today, there is a Sayo no Machida (oracle rice field) in
this district. The hill where the deer was slaughtered was named
Kaniha Yama (deer’s garden). There are twelve dales on the four
sides of this hill, from which iron [ore] can be obtained. Inu, of the
Wakebe family, discovered the iron. It was this Inu’s grandson who
began the custom of presenting iron to the court of the emperor [posthumously known as Emperor Kotoku who governed the realm from]
Toyosaki [Palace] in Naniha.!
Village of Sayo. The etymology of this village’s name is the same as
that of the district. The condition of the soil is excellent.
Yegaha. {The former name was Tamaochi Gaha (jewel-dropping
tiver).} The great god [once] dropped his jewel into this river. Thus,
it was named Tamaochi (jewel-dropping). Today it is called Yegaha
because Oho Yegaha of the Inasabe once lived in the village. {The
Japanese gold-thread [plant] grows on the hill of this village. }!!
Kurami. The Great Goddess Sayo produced iron saddles on the hill of
'° This story reflects the custom of establishing priority rights over crops. The
Taiho Code stipulated that if seeds were planted on the land the crops belonged to
the person who had planted them (“Ryo no gige,” 113-14).
'll This area was known for its excellent blacksmiths (who were Korean immigrants). The Wakebe were the people of the Wake family (see note 72). This story
suggests that at the time of Kotoku’s reign (645-54) the Wakebe people lost their
monopoly over the iron industry. Iron ore from that time on had to be turned over
to the central government.
'!? Names of plants can be extremely useful in identifying the location of a
particular site. For example, kakumagusa (Japanese gold-thread) grows in damp areas
where the sun never shines. It was‘used to treat stomach and intestinal ailments.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 205
this area. Therefore, the hill was named Kanakura (iron saddle) and
the river was named the Kurami (saddle-revealing).!
Ishi [Stream/River]. This is the upper part of the Kurami [River]. The
riverbed is as smooth as the surface of a bench. Thus, it is called Ishi
(bench). { ... and false goatsbeard grows on this hill. }!!4
Village of Hayase (rapid water). {The condition of the soil is excellent.} The village was so named because of the rapids in this area.
The goddess that presides at the Hayase Shrine is Hiro, the younger
sister of the Great Goddess Sayo.!!
Kohorino. When the goddess Hiro occupied this area, it was frozen.
Thus, the hill was named Kohorino (frozen hill) and the dale was
named Kohori Tani (frozen dale).
Village of Oho. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average. }
While he was in this village, Prince Mima dug a well, ate some dried
rice, and said, “I have acquired a lot of land now.” His words gave
rise to the name Oho (plenty). The spot where the prince dug the
well was named Miwi (august well).'!®
Kuhaye Gaha. Kamuhiko (Prince of the Divine Nature) obtained a
handle for his plough from the hill in this area. The river flowing from
this hill therefore was named Kuhaye (plough handle).!!”
Murofu Yama. This hill protects the area surrounding it in much the
same way as a cellar prevents the wind from blowing in. This is why it
was named Murofu. {Ginseng, udo, mercury, false goatsbeard, and
wokera are obtained there. This hill also produces limestone. }!!8
"3 See “Village of Kuhahara,” under the “District of Ihibo,” above; see also note 108.
'l4 The original has two graphs preceding the plant name “false goatbeard” but
the meaning of the graphs is indecipherable today.
5 Goddess Hiro: This is rendered as Hiro Hime (Hirohime) in the original.
'16 Prince Mima: The original has graphs that can be read as Mimatsuhiko (a
prince of Mima). Note that the name carries no epithet in this passage (see note 28;
see also HIT, note 56).
"17 Kamuhiko: Perhaps this is Prince Mima.
8 For the etymology of a similar name, see “Murofu no Tomari,” under the
“District of Ihibo,” above. Udo is Aralia Cordata Thunb. It was used as a medicine,
and hence was a tribute good.
206 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
Kuzuno. Prince Mima said, “This hill would be crushed if I stepped on
it.” Thus, it was named Kuzuno (crumbling hill). The name was later
changed to Uno. On the four sides of this area there are low hills and
at the center there is a flat field.!”
Village of Kashihahara. Oak trees grow abundantly in this village.
Therefore, it was named Kashihahara (oak-leaf field).
Uheto [River]. When he came from Izumo, the great god chose as his
bench a hill in the village of Shima, sat upon it, and set a fish trap in
this river. The river, named after the god’s fish trap, was called Uheto,
meaning “fish-trapping.” But no fish were caught in the trap. Instead
a deer became trapped in it. The great god prepared the deer [meat]
as namasu. As the god was about to eat, he dropped the first piece
before he could put it into his mouth. [He interpreted this as a bad
omen and immediately] left for another place.!”
Village of Nakatsugaha. {The condition of the soil is very good.} Nakatsugaha was named after a man called Oho Naka (Great Naka), the
forebear of the Toma no Obito (chieftain of the straw-mat makers).
On her way to Kara (Korea), Princess Okinaga Tarashi anchored her
fleet at Ihaya, a port of Ahaji Shima (Ahaji island). At that time a
heavy rainstorm soaked everything. The princess’s soldiers were
drenched. Oho Naka devised makeshift huts, using straw mats, in
which the soldiers took shelter. The princess [who was very pleased
by his ingenuity] said, “This man is indeed valuable to our country.”
Thus, she gave Oho Naka a kabane (title), calling him Toma no Obito.
After that [the man and his family] settled in this village. [The river
in this area] was named Nakatsugaha (the river of Naka) after this
man. The village was named after the river.
In the past, during the reign of the emperor [poshumously known

connotes “hills/plateau” but not “field” in this case (see “Kohorino,” above). Prince
Mima: Mimatsuhiko in the original, which can be rendered as Prince of Mima.
'20 Namaszu is sliced raw meat. By the eighth century the word had come to
mean sliced raw meat soaked in vinegar. Today the same word also means finely
sliced radish and/or carrots soaked in vinegar. The story indicates that meat was
part of the diet of people during this period. For the magical effects of eating, see
note 103. :
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 207
as Emperor Tenji, who held his court at Ohotsu] in Afumi, there was
a man named Sonafu of the Wanibe. He was a resident of Nakatsugaha.
Sonafu bought a sword from a resident of Tonoki in Kahachi Province.
After he obtained the sword, [several misfortunes befell his household,
and] all [the members of] his family died one after another.!”!
Later, a man named Inuwi of the Tomamibe unearthed a sword
while tilling a rice field. The sword was found under the topsoil at the
site of Sonafu’s former homestead. It was lying in a hole about a foot
in diameter. The handle of the sword was decayed but its blade was
not tarnished and it still shone like a mirror. The man thought this
strange and sent for a blacksmith to temper the blade. When it was
put to the fire, the sword wriggled like a snake. The astonished blacksmith refused to temper it. Inuwi then realized that the sword had a
divine nature and he presented it to the Court. [The sword was accepted by the Court.!”
[Many years later,] in the seventh month of the year of Kinoye
Saru [684], during the reign of the emperor [posthumously known as
Emperor Tenmu who had his court] at Kiyomihara, Maro of the Sone
no Muraji was commissioned to return the sword to its original place.
Today the sword is kept at the miyake (royal granary) in this village
[of Nakatsugaha].!”
Funahiki Yama. Chimori no Omi was appointed governor of Harima
Province during the reign of the emperor [posthumously known as
Emperor Tenji who held his court] in Afumi. Chimori constructed an
official ship on this hill. When the ship was finished, he had it slid
down the hill [to the sea]. That is why the hill is called Funahiki
(boat-pulling) .!%4
'21 The Wanibe are said to have been undertakers (Fudoki [Yoshino], 115).
!22 The NS records a similar tale in the section concerned with the time preceding
Emperor Tenji’s accession (see Nihongi, part 2, 276).
'23 Scholars disagree about the proper place of the sword story in the text. Given
the context, it would seem that this passage was independently compiled and
added to the original text some time later. The importance of the story lies in the
fact that this “sword of divine nature” was later kept at the miyake in this village.
Probably it was placed there as a symbol of the strengthened imperial institution
while also appeasing the soul of the dead.
'24 Ror Chimori no Omi, see note 63.

Kasasagi (idle chatterers) live on this hill. They are also called Korean
crows. These birds live in the hollows of dead trees and are seen in
spring but not in the summer. {Ginseng and wild ginger grow there. }
At the foot of this hill there are five damson plum trees, which bear
fruit until midwinter.!?°
Mikazuki Hara. During the reign of Prince Takatsu [posthumously
known as Emperor Nintoku, who governed the realm from Takatsu
Palace] in Naniha, there were two men whose extravagance was such
that they washed their feet with fine wine. These men were Kaguro
of Hahaki and Oyuko of Inaba. The Court considered their conduct
excessive [and disrespectful], and it dispensed Sayo of the Sawi no
Muraji to summon them. Sayo arrested all the members of the two
households and began the journey back to the capital. En route Sayo
tortured his prisoners by plunging them into water.!”6
Among these prisoners were two women who wore jewels on their
wrists and ankles. Sayo thought that these women must be persons of
some consequence, so he asked about their background. In answer to
Sayo’s inquiry the women said, “We are Una and Kuha, the daughters
of Miso of the Hatori no Muraji and his wife Princess Arasaka. As you
may know, our mother is [a daughter of] the kuni no miyatsuko of
Inaba: 712
Sayo was astonished. He said, “Then you must be the daughters of
one of the most influential persons at Court!” Immediately he released
the women. The place where they were released was named Mi-oki
Yama (farewell hill), and the place where Sayo tortured his prisoners
was named Mikazuki Hara (soaking field) .'”
"5 Midwinter: The eleventh month according to the lunar calendar.
"26 Note the manner of torturing the prisoners, which reminds one of the South
Vietnamese soldiers’ treatment of their captives during the Vietnam War.
"7 Miso of the Hatori no Muraji: This is rendered as Hatori no Miso no Muraji in
the original. In those days, when one wished to show respect for a person with a
particular name and title, it was customary to place the title (muraji in this case) at
the end of the name. Usually a man with an official title such as this would have
been known as Hatori no Muraji Miso (i.e., Miso, being his given name, would
have come last). In this tale, obviously, the daughters were very proud of their
lineage. Hence, they spoke their father’s name and title in this respectful fashion.
"* Translated as an “influential person at Court,” the original uses the term
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 209
Village of Uno. {The condition of the soil is excellent.} The god Tamatarashi, the son of the great god, fathered Prince Ohoiha by his wife,
goddess Tamatarashi. Prince Ohoiha was very submissive to his father’s
wishes. The place was named Uno (in agreement/harmony) after this
filial son.
Hamlet of Shihonuma. Salt water flows from the ground in this hamlet.
That is why it is called Shihonuma (salt marsh).
District of Shisaha
Shisaha was named after an experience of the Great God of Iwa.
After he finished founding his land, the god embarked upon an inspection tour of the hills, rivers, and valleys to determine the boundaries
of his territory. While on this tour he met a huge deer at the hamlet of
Yata. This deer was holding its tongue out as it walked. The god
declared, “An arrow is hidden under this animal’s tongue.” The district
was named Shisaha [abbreviated form of shishiaha, meaning “to have
met with deer”]. The hamlet in which where he saw the deer was
named Yata (arrow field).!”?
Village of Hii. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average.}
Hiji was named after a man who became the village headman of this
area. During the reign of the emperor [posthumously known as Emperor
Kotoku who governed the realm from] Toyosaki [Palace] at Nagara in
Naniha, the government divided Ihibo District in two and established
Shisaha District. At that time Hiji of the Yamabe was appointed village
headman. The village is known as Hiji after this man’s given name.!*°
Hamlet of Uhara. When he occupied this area, the Ugly Man in the
mahetsukimi (councillor). However, it would be difficult to identify any member of
the Hatori (or Hataori) no Muraji as a councillor at Court during Prince Takatsu’s time.
29 A similar story is found in the description of “Kakuhi Yama,” under the
“District of Kamo,” below.
130 Hiji of the Yamabe: This man would be the descendant of an influential
magistrate in the land of Harima. Yamabe means “mountain keeper.” According
to the SSR, the Yamabe’s forebear is the same as that of the Wake family (Saeki,
Shinsen shojiroku, 170-80; see also note 139).
DAO The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
Reed Field said, “This place is so small that it looks like the door of a
cellar.” Thus, it was named Uhato (front door).!*!
Hamlet of Hirami. The great god dropped his belt in this hamlet. It
therefore was named Hirabi (belt). Today people call it Hirami.
Hamlet of Kahato. The Prince of the Shining Spear stayed in this
hamlet. While he was there he said, “The river is very noisy.” Thus,
the hamlet was named Kahato (sounding river).
Hamlet of Nihato. {The former name was Nihaki.} [The great god
once travelled through this village carrying some rice.] The rice happened to get wet. Finding some mold on his rice, the god decided to
make wine out of it. [When the wine was ready] the god dedicated it
[to the spirits of this land] and feasted [with his followers] there.
That is how the place came to be called Nihaki (wine-dedicating
garden). Today people call it Nihato.!”
Ubahi Tani. Ugly Man in the Reed Field and the Prince of the Shining
Spear fought each other for possession of this area. The contenders
struggled by grappling in a valley. As a result, the shape of the valley
was greatly distorted. It looks like a series of twisted vines. Because
[the deities] grappled over [this place,] it is called Ubahi Tani (grappling ravine).)?
Inatsuki Mine. The great god had [his followers] pound rice on the
ridge of this hill. That is why the hill was named Inatsuki Saki [sic],
meaning “rice-pounding promontory.” {Tasty chestnuts grow there. }
51 Uhato: The original text has graphs that could mean “front door.” But the
name Uhato does not necessarily explain the name of the village, Uhara.
'? The word nihaki has been interpreted in two ways. Inoue Michiyasu takes it
to mean unrefined rice wine, while Akimoto interprets it as wine brewed for ritual
use (NKBT 2, 318, 11n; Inoue Michiyasu, Harima fudoki shinko, 356).
'> This story seems to underscore the potential conflict between the early
settlers and the newcomers. Apparently, the Prince of the Shining Spear (Ame no
Hihoko) is a product of the metal age. This name is listed in the section entitled
shoban (miscellaneous foreign origins) in the SSR. This means that the deity represented the newly arrived immigrants from the continent (Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku,
290, 306, 310).
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki Aan
The place where the bran of the pounded rice fell was named Nuka
Saki (rice-bran promontory).!*4
Village of Takaya. {The condition of the soil is the middle grade of the
inferior class.} Takaya was named after the words of the Prince of the
Shining Spear. He said, “This village exceeds all the other villages of
this area in height.” That is why the place is called Takaya (higher
houses).
Tsuda Gaha. No one was able to provide its etymology.
Hamlet of Shiho. The water obtained in this hamlet contains salt. That
is why the hamlet is called Shiho (salt). Cattle love to drink this water.'>
Village of Kashihano. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average.} Kashihano was named for the oak trees growing in this area.
That is why it is called Kashihano (oak-leaf field) .!°°
Inaka Gaha. When the Ugly Man in the Reed Field and the Prince of
the Shining Spear contended for this land, they happened to see a
horse crying by the side of this river. So the river was named Inaku
(neighing). [Today people call it Inaka.]
Hamlet of Hijima. The great god’s garment fell to the ground in this
hamlet. Thus, it was named Hijima (mud-getting land).
Hamlet of Shikikusa. The seat of the great god was prepared at this
place. It was made of grass. Therefore, the place is called Shikikusa
(grass carpet). There is a hill in this hamlet. About three miles from
this village is a marsh, which is about 2,500 feet in circumference.
4 Rice pounding: The Izumo fudoki contains a similar legend, though in that
story the deities pounded earth instead of rice. Rice pounding must have had a
strong ritual symbolism relating to the covenant between the leader of a given area
and his followers. Both Inatsuki Mine and Inatsuke Saki can be translated as “ricepounding hill.” The words saki, mine, and woka are used interchangeably in HAR.
See also Aoki, Izumo fudoki (p. 62) for earth stamping.
5 Today it is about fifteen miles from the sea.
'56 To be precise, kashiha means “oak leaf,” not “oak tree.” Hence, the place
name means “field covered with oak leaves” (see also “Village of Kashihahara,”
rder the “District of Sayo,” above).

Sedge grows in this marsh. The sedge grass [of this marshland] makes
the best hats. {Also growing there are cypress, Richard bald cypress,
chestnut, Japanese gold-thread, and vines. Iron [ore] is obtained there.
Wolves and bears live there. }}>”
Ihibe Woka. The [great god] who occupied this area prepared his meal
atop this hill. Thus, the hill came to be called Ihibe (cooking stove).
The shape of [the three peaks of this] hill resembles those of a rice
steamer, a winnow, and a cooking stove.!**
Village of Anashi. {The former name was the village of Suka.} The
condition of the soil is slightly above average. The great god had his
meal at this village. Therefore, it was named Suka (eating). The
name was later changed to Yamamori because Mima of the Yamabe
was made village headman. [The name was changed again;] at present,
it is Anashi. Anashi was named after Anashi Gaha, and the river was
named after the goddess Anashi.!?
The Great God of Iwa wished to court this goddess [Anashi] but she
repeatedly refused to see him. The god became so angry that he blocked
the flow of the river by piling up pebbles at its source. Thus, the river
changed its course and flowed in the direction of Mikata. That is why
Anashi Gaha is very small. Cypress, Richard bald cypress, and vines
erow on the hill of this village. Wolves and bears also live there.!*°
Village of Ishitsukuri. {The former name was Iwa.} The condition of
the soil is the middle grade of the inferior class. The Ishitsukuri no
Obito lived in this village. That is why the village was named
Ishitsukuri in the year of Kanoye Uma [670].!*!
57 The site of this hamlet is said to be the present-day Chigusa-mura. Inoue
Michiyasu interprets the graph for the first item in the original as kuchinashi (gardenia). Akimoto takes it to represent hinoki. Given the order of the plant descriptions
elsewhere in the document, it seems reasonable to assume that hinoki is meant
(Retinospora obtusa Sieb. et Zucc., usually rendered as cypress). See NKBT 2, 320,
6n; and Inoue Michiyasu, Harima fudoki shinko, 364.
'88 This story illustrates the early Japanese beliefin the efficacy of rice-eating rituals.
'° Yamamori means “mountain keeper.” The name Yamabe is derived from
their profession of “keeping mountains.”
'° This suggests that there was once an unsuccessful negotiation for alliance.
'1' Tshitsukuri no Obito was probably a kinsman of Ishitsukuri no Muraji of the
district of Inami. The title obito is one degree lower than that of muraji.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 213.
Ikama Gaha. When the great god occupied this land, he found squid
in the river. Thus, it was named Ikama (squid-living).!#
Village of Uruka. {The condition of the soil is the lowest grade of the
inferior class.} Konohana Sakuyahime, the wife of the great god, was
very beautiful. That is why the village was named Uruka (beautiful) .!%
Hamlet of Haka. When he contended with the Great God of Iwa, the
Prince of the Shining Spear arrived at this place ahead of the great
god. The great god was very alarmed, and said, “I did not expect him
to arrive before me, but he beat me there!” Thus, the place was named
Haka [by adopting the first two syllables of the word hakarazu (not
expecting) ]. It always rains when someone comes to this place without
washing his limbs. {Cypress, Richard bald cypress, spindle tree, vines,
and horseradish grow on the hills of this village. Wolves and bears
also live there. }!44
Village of Mikata. {The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the
inferior class.} The Ugly Man in the Reed Field and the Prince of the
Shining Spear arrived at Shini Take (Shini dale) where the soil is black.
With his toe each of them tossed three pieces of vine to determine his
territory. A piece of the Ugly Man’s vine landed in Keta District of
Tajima Province. Another piece landed in Yafu District of Tajima Province, and the third piece fell in this village. That is why the village
was named Mikata (the third piece). All three pieces [tossed by the]
Prince of the Shining Spear landed in Tajima Province. Therefore,
'42 Squid: The graph in the original is highly distorted. However, most commentators agree that it may be read as ika (squid). It may also be an abbreviation of
ikanago (sand lance).
3 Konohana Sakuyahime: This name is also found in NS and Kojiki tales. In
both documents, this beauty is Ninigi’s wife. However, the personage represented
by the name Konohana Sakuyahime may not be, for the name means “princess of
the blossoming flower.” Hence, she could be taken simply as a female chieftain or
as a group of people whose social customs were matrilineal.
\4 The racing story suggests the success of the newly arrived immigrants. The
place could have been the sanctuary of a tutelary deity of the early settlers, and
washing may have been a prerequisite of entering it. Note that the rival of the
Prince of the Shining Spear is described as a god of Iwa both here and under the
“Village of Tada,” below. In other parts of the document, the prince’s rival is the
Ugly Man in the Reed Field.
214 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
the Prince of the Shining Spear occupied Izushi District of Tajima
Province.!*°
According to another theory, Mikata was named for a deed of the
great god who planted his mace as a symbol of his presence in this
village. Thus, the village came to be called Mikata (respectful figure).
Ohouchi Gaha, Wouchi Gaha, and Kanauchi Gaha. The big river is
called Ohouchi (great space), the small one is called Wouchi (small
space), and the one that produces iron sand is called Kanauchi (ironcontaining). Cypress, Richard bald cypress, and vines grow on the hill
[that is the source of these three rivers]. Wolves and bears also live
there.
Hamlet of Iwa. {The former name was Miwa.} The great god brewed
rice wine in this hamlet. Therefore, it was named Miwa (divine wine).
The hamlet was also called Owa. After founding this land, the great
god said, “(I have finished my. work). I shall keep this as the place
where my coffin will rest.”!*
District of Kamusaki
Kamusaki was named after Kamusaki Yama [in the hamlet of
Yamasaki]. Prince Take Ihashiki, the son of the Great God of Iwa,
resides on this hill. Because of this, the district was named Kamusaki
(god’s territory).!47
Village of Haniwoka. {It includes the hamlets of Ikuno, Ohokahachi,
Yukaha, Ahaka[-kahachi], and Hajika.} The condition of the soil is

This kind of tossing game is still popular among Korean children.
'46 The last sentence is my liberal interpretation of the text. Japanese commentators do not agree in their interpretations. However, one thing is clear: the manner
of ending this tale is similar to that employed in an IZU legend (see Aoki, Izumo
fudoki, 83).
'47 Yamasaki: Inoue Michiyasu believes that the name of this village was included in the original text, while Akimoto considers it to have been an editorial
note made by a copyist of a later generation. Take Ihashiki: Perhaps this was a local
chieftain who came to be called Ihashiki (stone-built) after his burial chamber.

the lowest grade of the inferior class. Haniwoka was named after the
clay carried by the god Sukuna Hikone in his contest of strength with
the Ohonamuchi. Sukuna Hikone said, “Which do you think would
be more difficult on a journey: to carry a load of clay or to proceed
without stopping for a bowel movement? Ohonamuchi answered, saying,
“LIL wager on proceeding without stopping for a bowel movement.”
“Then I will wager on carrying a load of clay,” said Sukuna Hikone.
Thus, they departed on their journey.!*
Several days passed, and Ohonamuchi declared that he could proceed no farther. He stopped for a bowel movement. Sukuna Hikone
smiled at this, and said, “I am suffering, too.” With this he threw his
load of clay onto this hill. That is how the hill came to be called
Hani-woka (clay hill).
When [Ohonamuchi] had had his bowel movement, some feces
[that had dropped on the small bamboo leaves] rebounded from the
leaves and stained his clothing. Thus, the place was named the hamlet
of Hajika (repelling). The clay and feces turned into stones. [These
stones] are said to be still in existence.
According to another version, Haniwoka was named for Prince
Homuda’s words. While on an inspection tour, Prince Homuda constructed
a palace at this hill. He said, “This is the right kind of clay for [making
mud walls and ceramics].” Thus, it was named Haniwoka.!*?
[Ikuno was named at Prince Homuda’s discretion.] In the remote
past, there was a wild goddess living there who killed half the passersby. That was the reason why the place was called Shinino (dying
field). Later, Prince Homuda decided that this name was a bad [omen]
and he changed it to Ikuno (living field).!°°
Ahaka-Kafuchi was named for [the Ahaka Gaha], which rises in
Ahaka Yama in the district of Asako in Tajima Province. The Ahaka
'48 Haniwoka: See “Inadane Yama,” under the “District of Ihibo,” above. Sukuna
Hikone: See note 47; and Aoki, Izumo fudoki, 129. Hani: The word Haniwa
(cylindrical clay figurine) is derived from hani, meaning “clay.”
'49 This version of the etymology is more convincing than the first. It is probable
that the people of this era found the local clay suitable for ceramics.
150 There are two similar stories in the HAR (see “Oshi Kaha” and “Village of
Hirakata,” under the “District of Ihibo,” above).
1G The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
[River] valley thus was named Ahaka-kafuchi (around/within the
Ahaka). {Elm trees grow there. }
Ohokafuchi. It was named after the Ohokaha (big river). Therefore,
it was named Ohokafuchi (within the big river). {Cypress and Richard
bald cypress grow there. There are about thirty families there whose
customs differ [from ours] }.!*!
Yukaha. In the remote past, there was a hot spring in this river. Thus,
it was named Yukaha (hot-water river). {Cypress, Richard bald cypress,
and vines grow there. There are [also] about thirty families there
whose customs differ [from ours].}
Village of Kahanohe.{Seka Gaha and Tokaha Yama [are in this village].}
The condition of the soil is slightly below average. This village is located
alongside the river. Thus, it was named Kahanohe (beside the river).
Seka was named after a hunting incident involving Prince Homuda.
He cornered several wild boar and deer at this place and had his huntsmen shoot and kill [the animals]. Thus, the area was named Seka
(cornering). The prince continued to hunt until night fell and the
stars appeared in the sky.!** Therefore, it is called Hoshikura (numerous
stars).
Togaha Yama (sandstone-river hill) was so named because it produces
sandstone.
Village of Takawoka. {Kamusaki Yama and Nagusa Yama are in this
village.} The condition of the soil is about average. Takawoka (high
hills) was so named because of the high hills in this village.
Kamusaki Yama. The etymology is the same as [that for the name of
the] district.
'5! Families whose customs differ: It is significant that the HAR mentions these
people, for the NS and the SSR provide information about their possible forebears.
According to the NS, Yamato Takeru captured these aborigines in the northeastern region of the Japanese Islands and presented them to the Ise Shrine. Some of
them later moved to Harima (Nihongi, part 1, 209, 211-22).
'? In most texts, this sentence is placed after the Togaha Yama section, below.
Akimoto suggests that the Togaha Yama section was a later addition to the text.
My translation follows this suggestion.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 217
Nagusa Yama. {There is no etymological explanation for the name of
this hill. Cypress grows there.}
Village of Tada. {Ohowachino, Yachigusano,!? and Nuka Woka [are
included in this village].} The condition of the soil is slightly below
average. Tada was named for the words of Prince Homuda. Aganoko,
the forebear of the lord-in-waiting Sahekibe, earnestly requested that
the prince grant him this land when Prince Homuda came to the
area. The prince said, “You requested it so ardently.” Thus, it was
named Tada (ardently) .!%4
Ohowachino was named for the miscanthus used to construct a
fence around Ajisuki Takahikone’s palace. Ajisuki Takahikone (Prince
of the Shining Plough), who resided in the shrine of Nihisuki, built
the fence around his palace. That is why it was named Ohowachino
(tall miscanthus field) .!*
[The place known as Nuka Woka was named after bran piled high
at this place.| When the Great God of Iwa and the Prince of the
Shining Spear fought each other and mobilized their armies, the troops
of the great god gathered and pounded rice there. The bran from this
rice was piled high. These piles of the winnowed bran were called
tsuka (mounds). Some people also called them Kimure Yama (fortress
hills). According to another theory, people from Paekche built fortresses in this area [like the ones they knew in their homeland]. It
was during the reign of Prince Homuda that they came to this area.
Yashiro of the Miyake family, in the village of Kahanohe, is one of the
descendants of these Paekche people.!°
Yachigusano was named for the troops of the Prince of the Shining
Spear. The place was named Yachigusano (field of eight thousand
soldiers).
'53 Tn the following section, the description of Yachigusano is placed after that of
Nukawoka. Akimoto believes that the Nukawoka section may have been a later
addition.
'54 The word tada also means “directly.”
'55 Tt is generally agreed among Japanese scholars that ohowachi is a plant belonging to the miscanthus family. I concur in the general opinion.
156 The word kimure seems to be a compound composed of ki (fortress) and mure
(hills). Both words are of Korean origin. For the word nuka, see note 178.
218 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
Village of Kageyama. {Kage Woka and Kabuto Woka are in this village. }
The condition of the soil is slightly below average. Kageyama was named
after the headdress of Prince Homuda. Prince Homuda dropped his headdress while walking on the hill in this village. That is why [the village]
is called Kagayama (headdress hill) and [the hill] Kage Woka. On
the same outing, Prince Homuda discovered that his sword was not
sharp enough to cut his way through [the bushes and tall grass]. He
issued an order, saying, “Dig some sandstone and bring it to me.”!*’ That
is why the place was named the hamlet of Tohori (sandstone-digging).
Kabuto Woka was named for the helmet of the god Iyo. When the
god lyo was fighting Prince Uchikakumu (surrounding) Toyoho (strong
gates), the god dropped his helmet on this hill. Thus, the hill was
named Kabuto Woka (helmet hill).
Village of Ikuhabe. {The divine hill of Ihakura and the Takano Shrine
are in this village.} The condition of the soil is about average. The
village was named for the Ikuhabe who lived there.!®
Divine Hill of Ihakura. The god [Uchikakumu] Toyoho is consecrated
in this hill. Therefore, the hill is called Ihakura (divine rock chair).
The Takano Shrine was so named because of the height of the hill
on which it stands. It is the highest hill in the area. Therefore, it is
called Takano (high hill). The goddess Tamayori resides on this hill.
{The Japanese pagoda tree and the katsura tree grow there. }!9
District of Taka
Taka was named after the words spoken by a man in ancient times. Very
long ago there was a giant who always walked bent over. He went from
7 “Tig some standstone”: The original has four graphs that are variously interpreted by the commentators. Akimoto reads them as to horiko (dig sand stones and
bring them to me), while Inoue Michiyasu reads them as ma furiko (wave the
hemp strip). I have followed Akimoto.
'8 Tkuhabe: The SSR says that the Ikuha no Omi family was descended from
Kadzuraki Sotsuhiko, the general renowned for his military campaigns on the
Korean Peninsula during the reigh of Prince Homuda (Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku,
187, 199, 205).
'? Katsura is the Cercidiphyllum japonicum Sieb. et Zucc.

the South Sea to the North Sea, and from there he moved west. When
the giant arrived in this land, he said, “I always walked bent over
because in other places the sky is low. The sky of this land is high enough
so that I can stretch myself and walk upright.” This is why the district
was named Taka (being high). The giant’s footprints became marshes.!
Village of Kami. {Ohomi Yama and the hamlet of Arata.} The condition
of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior class. Kami (upper part)
was named after the location of the village on the upper part of the
river [called Sugihara Gaha].
Ohomi Yama was named for the people who lived in this area. In
the remote past people from the village of Ohomi in Akashi District
came to live at the foot of this hill. Thus, it was named Ohomi Yama.
Pine trees grow there.
Arata was named after the condition of the soil of this area. The
goddess of this area, who was named Michinushi (road mistress), gave
birth to a child deity whose father was unknown. The goddess wished
to learn the identity of her child’s father and so she planned to have
some oracle wine brewed. The goddess cultivated a rice field of about
fifteen acres. The rice ripened within seven days. The goddess then
prepared sake for oracle use, gathered a great number of gods, and
had her son serve the wine. The child god turned immediately, faced
the god Ame no Mahitotsu (Prince of the Heavenly Blacksmith), and
served him some wine. Thus did the child recognize his father. Afterward, this rice field went unused. That is why the hamlet is called
Arata (unused rice field.) !*
Village of Kuroda. {Ofu Yama, Kihe Woka, and Ohoamino are in this
village.} The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior
class. Kuroda was named after the color of the soil. It is dark; therefore, it [this place] is called Kuroda (black field).
Ofu Yama was named for the words spoken by the goddess
Okitsushima (island in the offing), the Great Goddess of Munakata.
In the remote past, the great goddess conceived a child by the great god
160 For an analysis of this tale, see Aoki, Ancient Myths, 118-19, 122.
'61 The tale strongly suggests the existence of matriarchal practices in ancient
Japan. For a more detailed discussion, see ibid., 157-58.
220 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
of Iwa, came to this hill, and said, “My time of waiting is over.” Thus,
the hill was named Ofu (is over) .!”
Kihe Woka was named for other words of the Great Goddess of
Munakata. The goddess said, “The time of my delivery has come.”
Thus, it was named Kihe (time has come).
Ohoamino was named for a net used to catch birds. In the remote
past there was an elderly couple [who made a living by catching birds].
They strung a huge net and caught birds on Ofu Yama. Once a great
number of birds came over, hit the net, and flew away with it. The
birds flew as far as this field where they dropped the net. That is why
it is called Ohoamino (big net field).
Village of Tsuma. {This village includes Tsutaki, Hiya Yama, Hiyano,
Suzuhori Yama, Iya Woka, Afu Yama, Takase, Masaki, Wanifutaki,
and Atakano.}!® The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the
inferior class. Tsuma was named for the tasty water of this area. When
they were determining the boundary between their territories, Harima
Tome [female chieftain of the land of Harima] and Taniha Tome
[female chieftain of the land of Taniha] came to this hill. They ladled
some water from a well in this village, tasted it, and said, “This water
tastes good.” Thus, the place is called Tsuma [an abbreviation of mitsu
umashi (water tastes good) ].!°
Tsutaki was named for the words spoken by the god Sanuki who
courted the female chieftain of this area. In ancient times the god Sanuki
came to court Hikami Tome (female chieftain of Hikami [in the land
of Taniha]). Hikami Tome consistently rejected him. But the god insistently kept courting her. This outraged the female chieftain, who asked,
“Why do you force me?” She finally hired Prince Take Iha and his troops
to get rid of the god Sanuki. The god Sanuki was severely defeated.
Upon returning to his home, he said, “How unskillful I am!” Thus, the
place was named Tsutaki [an abbreviation of tsutanaki (unskillful)].!%
‘6 The Great Goddess of Munakata was a tutelary deity of the Munakata no
Kimi family. The SSR lists this family name under the category of “earthly gods,”
namely, native chieftains (see Saeki, Shinsen shojiroku, 268).
' There is no description of Atakano in the text.
‘6+ Harima Tome and Janiha Tome: The word tome means “matron” and/or
“mistress.” From the context it can be taken to mean “female chieftain.”
' The story suggests a failed attempt at coalition. See “Village of Anashi,”
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 221
Hiya Yama was named for the cry of a deer. Once Prince Homuda
was hunting on this hill and came upon a deer. The deer cried “heehee.” Hearing the deer’s cry, the prince restrained his huntsmen.
Thus, the hill was named Hiya [in imitation of the deer’s cry. Likewise, ]
the field was named Hiyano.
Suzuhori Yama was named for a bell lost on this hill. When Prince
Homuda visited the area on an official inspection tour, he lost a bell
on this hill. Though the prince even had the soil turned over [with
shovels] to find the bell, it was never recovered. Thus, the hill was
named Suzuhori (bell-digging).'©
Iya Woka was named for an order of Prince Homuda. One of his
hunting dogs {whose name was Manashiro (snow white)} chased a
wild boar to this hilltop. The prince saw the chase and ordered his
men to shoot the boar. That is why the hill was named lya (arrowshooting). The dog died of wounds inflicted by the wild boar. The
prince buried its body on this hill. Inuhaka (dog grave) is on the west
side of this hill.
Afu Yama was named for a pole used to carry wild boar’s meat.
Thus, it was named Afu (carrying pole).
Takase was named for the shallowness of the river in this area.
Masaki was named for the prince’s hound whose eyes were injured
by the wild boar. Masaki means “eye-crushing.”!®
Atakano was named for the injured wild boar. While hunting in this
field, Prince Homuda [heard] the groaning of a wild boar that had been
shot with an arrow. It therefore was named Atakano (groaning field) .'*
Village of Hafuta. {Mika Saka and Hananami Yama are in this village. }
The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior class. Hafuta
under the “District of Shisaha,” above. Prince Take Iha is probably the Take
Thashiki described under the “District of Kamusaki”, above.
166 A similar story is related in the “Suzukuhi Woka” section under the “District
of Ihiho,” above. The bell had a special significance in terms of the owner’s magicopolitical power. [With shovels]: My addition. There is no such word as “shovel” in
the original.
'67 Another place known as Masaki has a different etymology. See “Village of
Masaki,” under the “District of Shikama,” above.
'68 Translated here as “groaning,” the word ataki may have had the connotation
of suffering in early times.
22). The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
was named for an act of the god Sanuki following his struggle with
Prince Take Iha. After he lost the battle, the god Sanuki crawled to
this area. That is why the place was named Hafuta (crawling field).
Mika Saka was named for Prince Take Iha’s cap. When he chased
the god Sanuki to this pass, Prince Take Iha said, “You will never be
able to cross this border again.” So saying, Prince Take Iha placed his
cap on this pass. That is why the pass is called Mika Saka [abbreviated
from mikage saka (cap pass) ].
According to another theory, Mika Saka was named for a large jar
buried at this place to mark the boundary between the lands of Taniha
and Harima. Therefore, it was named Mika Saka (jar pass).!”
Hananami Yama was named for the god who resides on this hill.
This is the god Hananami in Afumi.!”°
District of Kamo
Kamo was named for the wild geese that nested in the hamlet of
Kamo. It was during the reign of Prince Homuda that a pair of kamo
laid eggs there. Thus, the district was named for the birds, Kamo
(wild geese).!
Village of Kami Kamo. {The condition of the soil is slightly above average. }
Village of Shimo Kamo. {The condition of the soil is about average. }
The reason why these two townships are called Kamo was discussed
above. Kamo was originally one village. Later it was divided into the
two townships of Kami (upper) Kamo and Shimo (lower) Kamo.
While on an inspection tour, Prince Homuda saw a pair of geese
land in a tree near the Sufu no Wi (sucking well). The prince asked
what kind of birds these were. Sakitama of the Homuchibe no Kimi
'® This must be an indication of an existing custom. Haniwa, or clay figurines,
were used after burial to mark the boundary between this and the other world.
The early haniwa are in the shape of jars.
'0 According to the story of the village of Kahaahi in the district of Kamo,
below, this god was chased by his wife, the goddess from Afumi.
'! At one time this area was called Harima no Kamo no Kuni. (Fudoki
{Hisamatsu], 1:184).
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 223
in Tagima,'” the lord-in-waiting, replied that these were some of the
wild geese that flew along the rivers of the area. The prince ordered
the geese shot. [One of the prince’s huntsmen] shot the two birds
with an arrow. Although they were both pierced by the arrow, they
flew over the ridge of the hill in this village [that is, the old village of
Kamo] and fell into a dale. Thus, the ridge was named Kamo Saka
(geese pass) and the dale into which the birds fell was named Kamo
Tani (geese dale). [The prince’s men prepared the meat of the two
birds for his meal.] The spot where the meat was cooked was named
Nisaka (cooking pass).
There are three dales in the village of Shimo Kamo: Usuwi Tani,
Mitani, and Sakaya Tani. The place where the god Ohonamuchi
pounded rice was named Usuwi Tani (mortar dale) and the place
where he set his winnow was named Mitani (winnow dale). The spot
where the god Ohonamuchi built a sake brewery was named Sakaya
Tani (brewery dale).
Village of Sufu. {The condition of the soil is about average.} There is
a well in this village. Once a woman was sucked into the well as she
attempted to ladle water from it. Thus, the village was named Sufu
(sucking).
Kakuhi Yama. Kakuhi was named for a white deer that Prince Homuda
saw on this hill. The deer’s tongue was protruding when the prince
spotted it. That is why the hill was named Kakuhi (deer’s tongue
showing/tongue-showing deer) .!?
Hamlet of Homuchibe. Homuchibe was so named because Sakitama,
the forebear of the Homuchibe family, received a grant of land in this
area during the reign of Prince Homuda.
1722 The name Homuchibe has its etymology in the legend relating to a son of the
quasi-mythological Prince Ikume (posthumously known as Emperor Suinin) who
gained speech after seeing a swan, uttering its cry, flying over the palace (Nihongi,
part 1, 175). Note that the NS transcribes the name as Homutsube, while HAR
and Kojiki transcribe it as Homuchibe (NKBT 1, 198-99).
113 A similar story is related at the beginning of the section on the district of
Shisaha.
224 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
Village of Mihe. {The condition of the soil is about average.} Long ago
a woman [of this village] obtained a bamboo sprout. She wrapped it in
a cloth and nibbled at it. The woman then became numb. She
crouched in pain and was unable to stand. Therefore, the place came
to be called Mihe (crouching).'”
Village of Narahara. {The condition of the soil is about average. }
Narahara was named for the oak trees that grow there. Thus, the
village came to be known as Narahara (oak field).!”
Kisumino. Kisumino was named for the words spoken by Kurodawake,
the kuni no miyatsuko of this area. During the reign of Prince Homuda,
Ohotomo no Muraji petitioned the prince to grant him this land. The
prince summoned Kurodawake, the kuni no miyatsuko, for a report on
the condition of this place.!”° Kurodawake told him, “It is like a [refined]
garment stored at the bottom of a chest.”!”’ This phrase gave rise to
the name Kisumi (hidden treasure).
Ihimori Dake. The hill was so named because Ohonamuchi’s rice was
piled there.
Nuka Woka. Nuka Woka was named for the chaff that flew on this
hill when Ohonamuchi pounded rice in the village of lower Kamo.
That is why the place is called Nuka Woka (chaff hill) .!”8
There is a hamlet called Tamano [in this area]. The hamlet was
'4 This story seems to refer to an old custom of eating bamboo sprouts. It may be
related to the custom among Japanese children of wrapping a pickled plum in the
skin of a bamboo sprout and nibbling it. The word mihe literally means “three
folds.”
'5 Translated here as “oak trees,” the term in the original is nara, or Japanese
oak (Quercus glandulifera Blume).
'76 Kurodawake was probably the forebear of the kuni no miyatsuko of Kamo
(Saeki, Nihon kodai, 14). Ohotomo no Muraji: There are several places called
Otomo (the present-day designation of old Ohotomo) in this area. They must
have been named for this man and/or his descendants.
'1? By inference, this means “beautiful, well-conditioned, hidden land.”
"8 The original graph for nuka meant either “bran” or “chaff” in archaic Japanese.
Today it exclusively means “bran.”
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki 225
named after the jewels dedicated to the tomb of a beautiful woman
who died there. The royal princes Oke and Woke, who resided at the
palace in the village of Shijimi in Minagi District, sent Wotate of the
Yamabe [no Muraji] to court Nehime, the daughter of the kuni no
miyatsuko Koma of the Kurodawake family. Nehime accepted the
matriage proposal. The two princes, however, stood on ceremony [for
each was afraid of offending the other by marrying the girl first]. In
the end, neither of them married her.!”
Years passed, and the girl grew old and died. The princes were
grieved by her death. They sent Wotate with a royal proclamation
announcing their wishes regarding the girl’s funeral. The royal message
read “We shall have her tomb [placed] where the sun shines from
morning till evening. Be sure to bury her remains there, and decorate
her tomb with jewels.” That is why the hill was named Tama Woka
(jewel hill) and the village was called Tamano (jewel field).
Village of Kose. {The condition of the soil is the middle grade of the
inferior class. Kusaye and Kurokaha belong to this village.} Kose was
named after the Kosebe who lived in this village. That is why it is
called Kose.!*°
Kusaye. Kusaye was named for the smell of the corpses of people executed there. During the reign of Prince Homuda there were several
chieftains in the land of Harima who fought among themselves incessantly. Prince Homuda issued an edict prohibiting these contentious
and troublesome factions, and [then he] chased them all to this village
where they were executed. The bodies created a terrible stench, and
the blood of the dead turned black and flowed like a river. That is
'9 Princes Oke and Woke: Later these princes ascended the throne, the younger
Prince Woke first, then the older Oke. They are posthumously known as Emperor
Kenso (r. c. 480) and Ninken (r .c. 490). See Nihongi, part 1, 393. For Yamabe, see
note 130. Koma: The given name of this kunino miyatsuko, Koma, means “Korean”
in archaic Japanese.
180 The Kose family was influential in the Yamato region in the late seventh
century. The Kosebe were probably the people of the Kose family (Saeki, Shinsen
shojiroku, 173).

why this village is called Kusaye (stinking spot) and the river is called
Kurokaha (black river).'®!
Village of Yamada. {The condition of the soil is slightly below average. }
Ikahino is included in this village. Yamada was named for the people
who settled alongside the hill of this area. Therefore, the place is
called Yamada (hillside field).
Ikahino. Ikahino was named for a wild boar that was kept in this area.
During the reign of Prince Takatsu [posthumously known as Emperor
Nintoku] who governed the realm from Takatsu Palace in Naniha,
Asabe no Kimi, one of the Kumahito of Himuka [a resident of southeastern Kyushu], brought a wild boar to the boat in which the goddess
Amaterasu was consecrated. Asabe no Kimi asked the prince for a
place in which to keep the wild boar [in memory of the goddess
Amaterasu]. The prince gave this place to the man. The wild boar
was released on the hill. Thus, Ikahi (wild-boar keeping) became the
designation of this hill.!*
Village of Hashika. {The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the
inferior class.} Hashika was named for the words spoken by a god. In
ancient times there was a god who distributed nuts to the hamlets in
this area. But when he came to this hamlet he discovered that he was
short of nuts. The god said, “Indeed there are too few nuts.” Therefore, it was named Hashika (being short). {This deity still resides in
this village.} Even today, no trees in this village bear nuts. {Chinese
black pine, cypress, and Richard bald cypress grow there. }!*°
Village of Hotsumi. {Its former name was Shihono. Womeno belongs to
this village. } The condition of the soil is the upper grade of the inferior
'81 Several chieftains: The original has three graphs that can mean “one hundred
and eighty.” However, the word containing the graph denoting the number “eight” is
usually used to express a larger number. It is sufficient to assume that there were incessant battles for dominance in this area. See also the glossary, under momo-yaso.
'8? The Kumahito of Himuka were natives of southeastern Kyushu. Note that
Himuka traditionally is known as the place from which the first mythological
emperor of Japan [Jimmu] made a journey to the east.
'® Nuts: The original has the two graphs that read konomi in archaic Japanese.
Today the same graphs mean “sweet” (see glossary, under konomi).

class. Shihono was named after the salty water obtained in this village.
Thus, it was named Shihono (salt field). It is now called Hotsumi
because the Hotsumi no Omi family lives in this village.'*
Womeno. [Wome was named for words spoken by Prince Homuda while
he was on an inspection tour.] Prince Homuda stopped in this field,
looked all around, in every direction, and said, “What am I seeing
there? Is it a sea or a river?” “It is mist, your highness,” said the lordin-waiting. “I cannot see it in detail,” said the prince, “although I can
get a general idea of what it is.” Thus, the place was named Wome
(detailed view). The prince also composed a poem there.

Prince Homuda’s subjects dug a well at this place. It was named Sasa
no Miwi (bamboo-leaves well) .!*
Village of Urumi. {The condition of the soil is about average.} [The
original name of Urumi was Umi. It was named for the words of the
god Nitsuhiko.] The god Nitsuhiko wished to direct the water of
Hafuta Gaha toward Urumi, so he made a request to the great water
god of this village. The great water god disliked the idea, and said, “I
raise rice seedlings by using wild boar’s blood. I do not need river
water to do that.” The god Nitsuhiko reasoned aloud to himself, “This
god must be tired of digging the canal. That is why he does not agree
with me.” Thus, the place was named Umi (being tired). Today people
call it Urumi rather than Umi.!*
Village of Kafuchi. {The condition of the soil is slightly below average. }
184 The Hotsumi (also Hozumi) no Omi family had the same forebear as the
Mononobe family, namely, Ikaga Shikowo (ibid., 214, 272).
'85 Sasa no Miwi: Although the original places this section before the poem,
Akimoto considers the story about the well to be a later addition. Hence, he places
it after the poem. My translation follows Akimoto.

228 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
The village was named for the river that runs through it. Thus, the
village is called Kafuchi (within the river).
[Peasants] in this village do not spread straw before sowing rice
seeds; instead they sow the seeds [directly into the wet rice paddy].
[This custom came from an ancient episode.] The Great God of
Suminoye came to this village and had his [ritual] meal there. The
god’s servants scattered a haystack, which was made by a peasant [of
this village], to prepare seats for the meal. The owner of the haystack
naturally was upset by this, and he appealed to the god Suminoye.
The god judged the situation [to be serious, and he gave the man
a summary decision,] saying, “As to the seedlings of your rice field,
[I will cause them to grow] without the hay being spread over the
field. They will grow just as though [the seedlings were] protected
by [mulch].” That is how the farmers of this village came to use hotbeds for rice and no longer spread hay [on the ground prior to
replanting].!*’
Village of Kahaahi. {The condition of the soil is excellent.} Harasaki
Numa [is part of this village]. Kahaahi was named for the geographical
location of the village, which is situated where the Hashika Gaha
flows into the Kamo Gaha. It therefore is called Kahaahi (meeting
rivers).
Harasaki Numa. Harasaki was named for a goddess who disemboweled
herself and died at this marsh. The goddess from Afumi, the wife of
the god Hananami, came upon this place while she was chasing her
husband [and discovered that her husband had already gone elsewhere]. Greatly disappointed, the goddess disemboweled herself and
jumped into the marsh. This is why the place is called Harasaki (dis-
'87 The Great God of Suminoye (also known as Sumiyoshi) is a sea god who was
worshipped by seafarers. This god presides over Settsu. He traditionally was known
to have been married to a goddess in the Kako River Valley. Although it is lost in
the translation, the original text of this sentence employs the expression noboru (to
make a journey in the direction of the capital) where I have used the English word
came, indicating the direction in which the believer in this god travelled. In other
words, the belief came from the west, finally reaching Settsu Province. The legend
later became the story of Takasago Pine, a prototype of a No play. See Donald
Keene, No: The Classical Theatre of Japan (Tokyo: Kodansha International, 1966),
99, for a synopsis of the play. :

emboweling). The silver carp in this marsh are said to have no
entrails. !88
District of Minagi
Minagi was named for the words spoken by Prince Izahowake [posthumously known as Emperor Richu] while he was on a tour to determine the boundaries of his jurisdiction. When he arrived at the grove
of Koso, in the village of Shijimi, he said, “How beautiful are the
waters of this land.” Thus, the district came to be called Minagi [a
derivation of the word minagare uruhashi (beautiful rivers and
streams) ].'°°
Village of Shijimi. {The condition of the soil is about average.} Shijimi
was named for a clam that climbed up to the edge of Prince Izahowake’s
tice bowl. While Prince Izahowake was having a meal in this village,
he noticed a small clam that had climbed to the edge of his rice bowl.
The prince said, “This clam is identical to one I ate at Wanasa in
Aha.” That is how the village came to be called Shijimi (small clam) .!°
Shijimi is the place where the princes Oke and Woke [later known
as emperors Ninken and Kenso] spent their youth in exile. Following
the murder of their father, Prince Ichinohe [the son of Emperor Richu],
at Kutawatano in Afumi, the two princes fled to this village with the
assistance of Omi of the Kusakabe no Muraji. There they found shelter
in a stone cave.!?!
After securing this shelter for the princes, Omi unbridled their
horses, burned all their belongings to erase the evidence of their presence, and strangled himself. He strangled himself because he was aware
188 A similar story is related under the “District of Ihiho,” above.
'89 [zahowake was the heir to Prince Takatsu (Emperor Nintoku, r. c. 420) and
the grandfather of the princes Oke and Woke. The village of Shijimi was located
east of the present-day Yoshida, Miki-shi.
'9 Although it is translated here as “rice bowl,” the word literally means “box.”
In early times, steamed rice was carried and served in a small box.
'91 This section refers to the murder of Prince Ichinohe by Prince Oho Hatsuse.
Prince Ichinohe is here described as sumera mikoto, although he never ascended
the throne. This shows that the term sumera mikoto was not strictly reserved for the
emperor (see note 88; see also HIT, note 5). For the account relating to the murder
of Ichinohe, see Nihongi, part 1, 336, 378.
230 The Harima no Kuni Fudoki
that [by protecting contenders to the throne] he had committed a
grave offense [against the new ruler].!””
The two princes kept changing their shelters from one place: to
another, finally seeking refuge with Itomi, the village chief of Shijimi.
This they did by [disguising themselves] as servants. [Itomi was a rich
man, and he built a new dwelling while the princes were serving
him.] At the dedication of his new house, Itomi let the two princes
keep the light burning in the courtyard.!”
Later that night, Itomi asked them to sing congratulatory songs for
him. The princes told to each other, “After you,” but finally the younger
stood up and sang. Among the songs he sang was the following:
Tarachishi With iron hoe
Kibi no magane no Of Kibi,
Saguha mochi The sufficient,
Ta utsu nasu Till you the land.
Te ute kora Why not clap your hands;
Are ha mahi semu I will dance.
Also:
Afumi ha mitsu tamaru kuni The land of water is Afumi
Yamato ha Awogaki; The green fenced is Yamato;
Awogaki no Yamato ni mashishi He who governed the realm
Ichinohe no Sumera Mikoto ga _ In green fenced Yamato
Miana suye was Ichinohe; but his descendants,
Yatsuko rama Alas, are servants!
At this, everybody rushed to pay their respects to the princes. Among
them was Wotate, of the Yamabe no Muraji, who later was made supervisor of Yamato in the land of Harima, a territory under the direct rule
of the royal house. Wotate said, “They are indeed the sons of Princess
Tashiraga. I have heard that her grief at losing her sons is such that
she can neither eat nor sleep. She is dying of grief.”!™
'2 Omi was a toneri (royal attendant) at that time (see note 50).
"> A more elaborate account of this story is found in the NS (see Nihongi, part
1, 379-83).
"4 Princess Tashiraga: This name differs from the one given in the NS. According to that source, the mother of the princes was Hayahime (ibid., 377). Also see
“Nuka Woka,” under the “District of Kamo,” above.
The Harima no Kuni Fudoki Zon
Thus, Wotate journeyed to the Court [to see Princess Tashiraga]
and reported to her what he had witnessed. [By that time Prince
Ohohatsuse, who had murdered the princes’ father, had died.] Princess
Tashiraga’s joy was such that she shed tears at the good news. She
immediately sent Wotate to fetch her sons. The princess and her sons
rejoiced upon seeing each other and they spoke together of [their
long and painful separation].!”°
Afterward the princes returned to the village of Shijimi and constructed their palaces there. Thus, the palaces of Takano, Wono,
Kahamura, and Ikeno were built. Royal granaries were also constructed. The hamlet in which the granaries were built was named
Miyake, and the place where the granaries stood was named Mikurawo
(royal granary site) .!*°
[EDITOR’S NOTES]
The deities who reside in the shrine of Hafuta of the village of Takano
are Tamatarashihiko Ohoinawo and Tamatarashihime Toyoiname.
The god who resides in the shrine of Misaka in the village of Shijimi
is Ashihara no Shikowo (Ugly man in the Reed Field) whose other
name is Yatokakasu Mimoro. When he consolidated this land, the
Ugly Man in the Reed field ascended to the top of Misaka no Mine
[and became the guardian god of products].
The name of the village of Yegaha was so designated because the
goddess Yegaha no Ohotoji (female chief) resides there.
The name of the village of Hirano (flat field, or opened field) was
so decided because of the configuration of the land there.
The name of the village of Takano (highland) was so decided
because of the configuration of the land there.
'95 Probably this story was one of the sources of the Kojiki and the NS’s account
of the accession of the princes. The authenticity of the story, however, is open to
question.
'% Tt is significant that so many royal granaries were built in this area. The early
Yamato rulers seem to have used it as a base for their western and northern campaigns.
